  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the allegations I made was that six <span class="highlight">male</span> Aborigines were directed with the approval of the Superintendent to round up three girls and, as a punishment for an offence, take them out bush to be continually raped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 have referred both my allegations and your statement to  Mr Nichols  who originally supplied me wilh the information, and as a result he has informed me of the names of the three girls and the six males concerned and the names of eight staff members who would verify the accusations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Initiations, <span class="highlight">male</span> and female circumcisions, the promising of young girls in marriage to old men are all parts of traditional culture which are still practised in Aboriginal communities of the Territory but which, judged from Western eyes, are repugnant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we compare that price with the 61.34c a pound that they received in the 5 years from 1951-52 to 1955-56 we see that there has been a fall of 40%, notwithstanding the fact that the minimum weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> rate for a full weeks work, excluding overtime, has risen from $20.18 in 1950 to $49.14 today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second is the provision of our National Service Act compelling registration for national service by any <span class="highlight">male</span> person in this country, irrespective of who he is, in his twentieth year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the current periods of engagement were shortened, it is probable that there would be a marginal increase in the size of adult <span class="highlight">male</span> intakes but this could be more than nullified by the shorter periods of effective service that we would get from our trained personnel and the resultant increase in costs and in the training load. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700407_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am well aware that such  a  rent exceeds  20%  and could even be as much as  25%  of the current incomes of some families who receive at least the minimum wage but considerably less than the average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> eanrings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">male</span> red kangaroo is a comparatively large animal which comes out to graze and which can be seen, if properly nurtured, before dark and again after daylight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is completely indiscriminate slaughtering of the species regardless of whether the kangaroos are <span class="highlight">male</span> or female and regardless of whether there is a joey in the pouch or at foot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was when 1 first raised the charge of bad administration at Yuendumu and the sensational charge that orders were given to 6 <span class="highlight">male</span> Aboriginals to round up 3 Aboriginal girls and take them out into the bush for a fortnight to be continually raped as a penalty for some misdemeanour or some behaviour in the camp. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For a long time hospital and medical charges have been rising at about 3 times the rise of average <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I found that some of the measures in force to influence decentralisation of industry in the United Kingdom were: 40 per cent cash grants for plant and machinery; 25 per cent building grants given to service industries as well as manufacturing; discretionary loans and grants, including the possibility that the Board of Trade in the United Kingdom could subscribe to shares and stock; resettlement and removal grants for workers; grants to local authorities to rehabilitate derelict land and improve basic public services; controls on factory development in prosperous regions under industrial development certificates; and a wage subsidy of  1.10.0  as a regional development premium for each adult <span class="highlight">male</span> manufacturing employee in the development areas for at least 7 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should be noted that the survey related only to full-time adult <span class="highlight">male</span> employees and related only to weekly earnings in the particular pay-period in which the survey was conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that working women who receive pay and status equal to that of a <span class="highlight">male</span> worker can retire at age 60 years and receive the old age pension, when equal pay becomes the rule in this country will the Minister consider reducing the retiring age for the <span class="highlight">male</span> to 60 years instead of the present 65 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, males should be allowed to retire first so that they can have an equal number of years of leisure before they totally retire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All pensions will be immediately raised by $1.50 and thereafter, every spring and every autumn, the basic pension rate will be raised by $1.50 until it reaches 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government has approached the very sensitive and delicate field of diplomacy and foreign relations with the same finesse as would a rogue <span class="highlight">male</span> elephant in a herd of females and with the same devastating results to all those around it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pause there to emphasise the word ‘immediately’ -   by $1.50 and thereafter, every spring and every autumn, the basic pension rale will be raised by $1.50 until it reaches 25 per cent  of  average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already we find indications that with the rate of inflation this year, unless economic policies are changed by the new Government, it will not be possible at the rate proposed ever to achieve a base pension rate of 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  am sure that neither the Minister nor any other honourable senator opposite would deliberately set out to make a situation in which pensioners were not able to achieve the proposed 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 also make the point that the selected basis of 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings is something which in many ways is unfortunate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The trouble is that average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings fluctuate considerably from time to time during the year and, therefore, they are not as reliable a basis for varying pension rates as would be a relationship to national income per capita. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Austraiian Labor Party, running true to form and always honouring its promises, said in its policy speech that it would introduce these measures which would give a rise of $1.50 a week in the basic pension rate and again in the spring and in the autumn sessions until such time as the basic pension rate reaches 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another thing on which the Government has given an assurance is that while it is the Government - and this will be for many years - the pension rate will never again fall below 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All pensions will be immediately raised by St. 50 and thereafter, every spring and every autumn, the basic pension rats will be raised by $1.50 until it reaches 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope the Minister for the Media will answer the following 2 questions for me: How is it expected that the 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings level will be reached and by how much, if a S3 increase is paid to age pensioners this year, will the rate fall behind the projected figure due to the present inflationary trend? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because separate total income figures are not shown for males and females on pay-roll tax forms, estimates of average weekly earnings are calculated on the basis of ‘employed <span class="highlight">male</span> units’, i.e. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>total <span class="highlight">male</span> employment plus a proportion of female employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proportion is determined by the estimated ratio of female to <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I again state that it is not a true indication of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All pensions will be immediately raised by $1.50 and thereafter, every Spring and every Autumn, the basic pension rate will be raised by, $1.50 until it reaches 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator then queried - this just makes one smile - whether it was feasible for the Australian Labor Party, in accordance with the clear statement made by our leader, to increase the pension rates by $1.50 in the spring and autumn sessions of the Parliament until such time as they represented a full 25 per cent of the average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is now concerned that it may well be that because of the movement in the average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings $1.50 a session would not be adequate to reach that percentage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has claimed that it will be related to 25 per cent of the average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Minister may have admitted that his Government might have to review the question of the rate at which the pension shall be increased to achieve the target of 25 per cent of the average of the weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings, I think I must point out again that one of the important planks which the Labor Party put down in the election campaign was its desire to have a pension rate which, to quote the Prime Minister again, ‘will no longer be tied to financial and political considerations of annual Budgets’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has happened is that in the past there has been some hardship in regard to <span class="highlight">male</span> spouses, and I think that there needs to be rectification of their position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the fact that working women who receive pay and status equal to that of a <span class="highlight">male</span> worker can retire at age 60 years and receive the old age pension, when equal pay becomes the rule inthis country will the Minister consider reducing the retiring age for the <span class="highlight">male</span> to age 60 years instead of the present 65 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, males should be allowed to retire first so that they can have an equal number or years of leisure before they totally retire? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We propose that these lump sums be related to the national average weekly earnings, on a seasonally adjusted basis, per employed <span class="highlight">male</span> unit as published by the Commonwealth Statistician and this will provide an automatic adjustment at quarterly intervals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is in pursuance of a view which I held in relation to unmarried <span class="highlight">male</span> and female members of public superannuation schemes whether it is this scheme, the Commonwealth Public Service superannuation scheme or the parliamentary superannuation scheme andI disclosed my interest in my dissenting report in terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendment which I shall present is one which sets out to provide that unmarried <span class="highlight">male</span> and female contributors to the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund would have some entitlements to pass on in succession to a surviving mother, brother, sister or child, particularly if dependent, in the same way as can a married man in the Services in relation to his surviving widow and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Excluding unmarried service personnel below the age of 26 years (most of whom will marry or leave the Services) and presuming that those above the age of 45 years will not marry - on the figures in the First and Second Schedules 13.6 per cent of female personnel in that category will continue in the Service unmarried until retirement, but only 9.4 per cent of <span class="highlight">male</span> personnel in the same category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will recall that yesterday in the course of debate on the defence forces retirement benefits scheme I moved an amendment to the second reading to project the same principle in relation to <span class="highlight">male</span> and female unmarried members of the defence forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is Government policy that this type of rise should continue until the pension rate is 25 per cent of the average <span class="highlight">male</span> weekly earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He did not know whether it was 25 per cent or 30 per cent of the average <span class="highlight">male</span> wage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They went to the people and said: ‘We will raise pensions until they are one-quarter of the average <span class="highlight">male</span> wage’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Previously, the big red was neither pregnant- a phrase to which the honourable senator referred- - nor identifiably <span class="highlight">male</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would ask honourable senators to contrast what this Government has done- the generous rates of increase in pensions, both in money terms and percentage rates against the indices set out in the table- with the record of the last Government which in the year ended June 1971, for instance, when the average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings increased by over 13 per cent, increased married and standard rates of pensions by a mean and miserable 7.6 per cent and 6.7 per cent respectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">male</span> voice on the telephone then said:  Mr Dexter  is not here’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As announced in the Prime Minister’s Policy Speech, the Government intends to increase the basic pension rate every Spring and every Autumn until it reaches 2 5 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I confirmed, in that Speech, the Australian Government’s determination to achieve its goal of a standard rate pension of 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings and indicated that, if it is necessary, the pension increase for the Autumn Session will be greater than $1.50 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator will be aware that in the policy speech of the Prime Minister delivered before the last election the Labor Party undertook to increase pensions at the rate of $1.50 in each sessional period of the Parliament until the value of pensions had reached 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will continue that policy until the value of pensions is 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I told him that it was Government policy, in accordance with an election undertaking given by the Prime Minister, that in each session of the Parliament the Australian Government would increase the subvention payable to pensioners by $ 1 .50 a week until the pension reached 25 per cent of the average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But today it has been revealed to me that somebody in Canberra in an office, not in Parliament, not so far as I can learn even with ministerial approval and not so far as I can learn with Government confirmation, has devised a scheme whereby, if a partnership is exporting a crop, the view is taken in this edict from the office that the shares of the <span class="highlight">male</span> partners who actively participate in the orcharding activities are to be proportionate to their shareholding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a partnership of 3 <span class="highlight">male</span> partners has an export crop of 15,000 bushels, does it mean that each <span class="highlight">male</span> partner is entitled to $ 1 ,500? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before asking my question may I say that I acknowledge the fact that the Government increased the age pension by $1.50 in the last Budget and that these increases will be made twice yearly until the pension is 25 per cent of the <span class="highlight">male</span> average wage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But because it is impossible for me or anyone else to speculate on what the rate of inflation will be in future years it is naturally impossible for me to say when the full pension rate will amount to 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The shares of <span class="highlight">male</span> partners who actively participate in the orcharding activity are to be proportionate to their shareholding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if a partnership is exporting 20,000 cases and 4 <span class="highlight">male</span> partners are actively participating in it, each partner gets $1,500. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there are 8 partners who export 40,000 cases, each partner gets $ 1 ,500- if they are <span class="highlight">male</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On each occasion I have said that the Government’s policy is to increase the rate of pension until such time as it is equal to 25 per cent of the average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nonetheless, I reiterate that he belonged to a government which was in office for 23 years and which did not at any time give an undertaking that pensions would be based on a certain percentage of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said over and over again, as  Mr Hayden,  the Minister for Social Security, has said that this Government’s policy is to phase out the means test in the lifetime of the Parliament, assuming that the Parliament runs for 3 years, of course, and to increase pension rates until they are equal to at least 25 per cent of the average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government’s scheme to replace voluntary health insurance with a compulsory, tax-financed scheme is a creation of men- not doctors, mind you, but <span class="highlight">male</span> academics and economists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the point is that they are exhibiting themselves- I do not know whether they are discriminating against themselves as being males- as chauvinists and probably prigs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do not see how they can differentiate before themselves and <span class="highlight">male</span> academics and economists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seeing the farcical nature of that result, the Department put out an edict saying that in the case of partners, if there were 3 <span class="highlight">male</span> partners, it would give $1,500 to each. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The standard rate of pension at 1 December 1972 was $20.00 a week, representing 20.7 per cent of average weekly earnings per employed <span class="highlight">male</span> unit in the September 1972 quarter or 19.2 per cent of average weekly earnings in the December 1972 quarter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-84-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Acting Deputy President,  you would be aware that today the buying power of the basic pension is less in percentage terms of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings than it was when Labor took office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>4) on 18 September 1973 I said that the Australian Government was determined to achieve its goal of a standard rate pension of 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings and, if necessary, the pension increase for the autumn session would be greater than $ 1 .50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new standard rate of pension will be 22.57% of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings, seasonally adjusted for the December quarter 1973, of $115.20 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already we find indications that with the rate of inflation this year, unless economic policies are changed by the new Government, it will not be possible at the rate proposed ever to achieve a base pension rate of 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All pensions will be immediately raised by $1.50 and thereafter, every spring and every autumn, the basic pension rate will be raised by $ 1 .50 until it reaches 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inherent in that statement was the belief and the pledge that by increasing the pension by $1.50 twice a year it would reach, and reach in quick time, 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These pension increases are to be seen, not in the terms of an increase of $1.50 twice a year until the basic rate is 25 per cent of the average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings but in terms of the fact that today the Government would have to give more than $3 twice a year; it would have to give something like $4.50 or $4.60, maybe $6, which is double the present increase, to achieve its goal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When this Government came into office, the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  gave an undertaking to the Australian people, and particularly to those people on pensions, that we would move in Parliament each session for an increase of $1.50 a week until such time as the pension was 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Re-engagement rates for the December 1973 quarter compared with the December 1972 quarter for <span class="highlight">male</span> other ranks were as follows: For the quarter ended December 1972, it was 59.3 per cent for the Navy, 72.3 per cent for the Army and 72.3 per cent for the Air Force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As honourable senators know the Government is committed to increasing pensions twice annually until the standard rate of pensions reaches 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new standard rate established by this Bill will be 26 per cent of seasonally adjusted average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings for the March quarter 1974, the latest quarter for which figures are available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be almost 25 per cent of the estimated average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings seasonally adjusted for the June quarter of 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the interim report of the Australian Government’s Commission of Inquiry into Poverty, Professor Henderson proposed that, for the Budget of 1974, the standard rate of pension should be $27 a week, increased by rises in average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings since August 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the basis of estimated average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings for the June quarter 1974 this would justify an increase in the standard rate of pension of approximately $4.90 over the present weekly rate of $26. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The anomaly is that if a widow is caring for such children there are government programs to assist her, but if a <span class="highlight">male</span> parent has accepted the total responsibility for the children there is no government assistance to which he is entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A voter for the Assembly had to- be 2 1 years of age, and <span class="highlight">male</span> possess freehold property to the value of 50 or the annual value of 5, or occupy a leasehold worth 10 per annum, or be a householder of the annual value of  1 0, or  be in legal occupation of Crown lands for a period of 1 2 months in consideration of any payment to the public revenue, or  be in receipt of an annual salary of 100. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suppose that within our traditional <span class="highlight">male</span> chauvinist society it did cause a little confusion that the Government was at least recognising the fact that there were men who were placed in the position, which has traditionally been ascribed to women, of having the responsibility of looking after children without the assistance of the mother of the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure my <span class="highlight">male</span> colleagues on this side of the chamber are very pleased to have yet another civilised woman in this place who can raise the standard of debate in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is an accusation that approximately 2 years ago a naked Aboriginal girl was bashed by a <span class="highlight">male</span> warder at Boggo Road Goal and left without medical attention for 4 days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741022_senate_29_s61/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the reasons is that female warders will not stay in the place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741022_senate_29_s61/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a very amusing book which introduced us for the first time, in English fiction at least, to the occupation of the professional co-respondent- the person, be it <span class="highlight">male</span> or female, who was available for a fee to establish, complete with private detectives, photographs and so on, instant proof of the commission of adultery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To give an example, take the case of a couple who married comparatively young and the <span class="highlight">male</span> partner undertook, say, a medical course and, in order to make it possible for him to study fulltime, his wife went out to work and, in effect, kept him for a few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The population statistics for Aboriginals in 1971 show that, of some 106,290 individuals, 53,919 were <span class="highlight">male</span> adults and children and 52,371 were females. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is probably very obvious to all those married <span class="highlight">male</span> senators who are present that if they did not have wives prepared to support them strongly and to supplement the job they do here in the Senate and also in their home States then they would not be able to do the same job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What concerns me further is the fact that although <span class="highlight">male</span> senators are under some restriction as to what they are allowed to wear in this chamber, female senators appear to be under no restriction because if I look to my right tonight I can see a newly elected female senator,  Senator Coleman,  dressed in what I would describe as an open-neck shirt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The banks will endeavour to use their allocation under the Act so as to achieve as high a proportion as practicable of their total housing loan approvals under this scheme to persons earning less than $150 per week, and will continue not to make any distinction between <span class="highlight">male</span> and female applicants in the approval of housing loans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Northern Development and the Northern Territory been drawn to newspaper reports that the women of Darwin are pressing for a bigger say in the reconstruction of the city because the old city had ample resources for <span class="highlight">male</span> leisure and recreation but little for women and children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet I put it to you,  Mr Deputy President,  that a lot of women in this day and age would be more financially stable than their <span class="highlight">male</span> counterparts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that that <span class="highlight">male</span> relative may have been already fully committed to his own family or that he may in fact have been unemployed, or even that the sole <span class="highlight">male</span> relative available to put his signature on a piece of paper may have been an alcoholic, did not make the slightest bit of difference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is one difference which I think I pointed out some time earlier this year in answer to a question by  Senator Coleman  about repatriation benefits, and that is that the widows of <span class="highlight">male</span> veterans are entitled to war widow benefits whereas the widowers of deceased women veterans are not entitled to similar benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the precarious balance outlined last night by the Treasurer in that he is predicting an increase of 22 per cent in the average <span class="highlight">male</span> weekly earnings for this financial year, I ask: What measures are the Minister and the Government taking to support private employers who are expected to resist over-award claims for increased wages in view of the Government’s proclaimed support for wage indexation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is possibly a fair proportion of the <span class="highlight">male</span> population who have or could develop some disability relating to the prostrate gland, but the insurance company does not consider that worthy of the endorsements or discriminatory clauses that apply to female disorders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She may want to have the same type of insurance coverage as she provides for the <span class="highlight">male</span> executives she employs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, a white collar worker- <span class="highlight">male</span>, of course- probably would be on the lowest scale of risk, while a labourer probably would be nearer the highest scale, depending on the type of labouring job that he was doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So what those discriminatory clauses mean is that a woman pays 50 per cent more than her <span class="highlight">male</span> counterpart for each $10 a week coverage for the sickness component, even if they are doing the same job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Would they consider, even though their counterparts are female, that they are still second rate citizens and not entitled to equality? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I find it even more astounding when considering the figure with which I have already provided the Senate which shows that more than 50 per cent of the entire population are female. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She may not even be able to take out insurance coverage for those goods- it depends entirely on the insurance company- but a <span class="highlight">male</span> in the household will be able to take out insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me to be totally wrong that an Australian <span class="highlight">male</span> should be obliged to work until he is 65 years of age before he can retire and receive a pension, while thousands of teenagers are walking around the streets of this country looking for employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will know it is the Government’s objective to progressively lift the standard of living of pensioners by raising the standard rate of pension twice a year until it reaches 25 per cent of seasonally adjusted average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposed standard rate of pension is $38.75 a week which is equivalent to 25.2 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings for the June quarter 1975, the latest quarter for which figures are available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Already we find indications that with the rate of inflation this year, unless economic policies are changed by the new Government, it will not be possible at the rate proposed ever to achieve a base pension rate of 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So I ask you,  Mr President,  if you would give serious consideration to allowing honourable senators to come into the chamber, not necessarily wearing shorts- that might be something that would have to be put to a test- but allowing them, if they so desire, at least to come into the chamber coatless so that they can be a little more comfortable, just as the female senators can be when they take their place in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I see this as a retrograde step and one which will reduce the rate of pension below the rate that would have applied had the normal procedure of bringing the pension to 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings been followed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Applying the Labor Party’s policy of 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings the standard pension would increase by $2.75 a week making a total of $43 a week or S1.75 more than the amount proposed by the Government in legislation to be introduced later in this session. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that it raises a bit of a giggle among my <span class="highlight">male</span> colleagues and even my <span class="highlight">male</span> constituents, but the fact of the matter is that women are depicted on radio and television and in the newspapers as happy little twirps who have no mind of their own and as some sort of a vegetable that has a continual smile on its face, that is never allowed to lose its temper, that is never allowed to be a human being and that is never allowed to have hates and loves of its own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So, a Bill like this, designed simply to carry on the old ship for the purpose of providing the old pensioner’s legal right to float through the rest of his life, is being taken advantage of to give to those <span class="highlight">male</span> dependants not merely a pension until remarriage or death, as is the entitlement under section 46 of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister comment on what seems to be the practice, although not the policy, of her department in respect of supporting mothers; that is, where a supporting mother shares accommodation with a <span class="highlight">male</span> person she is automatically assumed to be in a de facto relationship with that person and thus to be ineligible for the supporting mothers’ benefit? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As some of these officers are now posted to senior established positions previously considered to be exclusively for <span class="highlight">male</span> officers, will the Minister request the Minister for Defence to consider a special review of salary scales applicable to these officers which are less than those applicable to <span class="highlight">male</span> officers and to consider any similar situation or anomaly affecting other servicewomen? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that a pay rate differential of 20 per cent still exists between <span class="highlight">male</span> and female Army officers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However I shall pass on to him  Senator Missen  ‘s question about the discrepancy, which does appear to be revealed in the question, between the pay of <span class="highlight">male</span> and female members of the defence forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A very distressing case was brought to my attention yesterday concerning a <span class="highlight">male</span> age pensioner caring for his totally blind wife, who is also additionally handicapped by the loss of a leg. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, the annual income of a <span class="highlight">male</span> employee on average weekly earnings of $180,30 would be about $9,300. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So actually a wage earner today receiving average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings would be paying the 2.5 per cent levy on $9,300 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, a wage earner earning average <span class="highlight">male</span> weekly earnings of $ 1 80.30 will pay under the proposed levy $232.50 a year, whereas that same wage earner in 1974 under Labor’s proposed 1.35 per cent levy would have paid only approximately $120 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although the female work force had grown much faster than the <span class="highlight">male</span> work force over the nine year period, in recent times between June, 197S and June, 1976, the female workforce did not expand at all, while the <span class="highlight">male</span> work force grew by 5000 or by 2 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>The reason I posed the question in that form was that I did not think any <span class="highlight">male</span> over the age of 35 years would be silly enough to leave Australia to serve in a foreign army. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suppose that if she had had a grown-up son he could have found some items of <span class="highlight">male</span> clothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As it is, she has two young sons but I presume that he was looking for adult <span class="highlight">male</span> items of clothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mrs Miller  was terrified and said that she did not have a man friend although in fact she did have a <span class="highlight">male</span> friend who visited here from time to time but with whom she had never had a de facto relationship nor had she ever had such a relationship with any man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That night  Mrs Miller  contacted her parents and on their advice went to the Social Security Office next day and saw a social worker and explained about her <span class="highlight">male</span> friend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the only reason she told him that she did not have a <span class="highlight">male</span> friend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was only because she was worried that she went to the Department and told it that she had a <span class="highlight">male</span> friend who visited her at her home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The effects of televised violence emerged as one of the major issues, but much concern was shown also about the effects of the constant exposure of children to programs which portrayed <span class="highlight">male</span> and female role stereotypes, unreal or foreign lifestyles and the gratuitous use of sex. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Based on an average weekly wage of $ 160- which is the minimum adult <span class="highlight">male</span> rate- and taking into consideration that a proportion of workers would be single taxpayers and a proportion would claim for dependent spouse, another $620m would be involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have drawn up a table which shows the tax payable by a single adult <span class="highlight">male</span> on average weekly earnings, comparing the September quarter of 1978 with the September quarter of 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last month’s unemployment figures showed the unemployment rate to be 5.2 per cent for the <span class="highlight">male</span> work force and 9.4 per cent for the female work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The unemployment rates for adolescents were 15.7 per cent for males and 23.5 per cent for females. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The higher rate of unemployment for females directly relates to their concentration in but a few occupations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a <span class="highlight">male</span> in a particular area of the work force is named to be redeployed or retrenched, who is most at risk? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the females in those areas are most at risk when a man is declared ‘in excess’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ratio of female to <span class="highlight">male</span> trainee technicians is unlikely to change substantially in the near future because of the very few applications being received from suitably qualified females and, in the case of the Navy, the requirement to maintain a satisfactory sea-to-shore service ratio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-86-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Reviews by  Mr Wraith,  then State Director of the Department in Tasmania, and  Mr Lanigan,  the Director-General of Social Security, decided in December 1977 that  Mrs Clarke  was not eligible for the widows pension because she was living in what was called a de facto relationship with a <span class="highlight">male</span> in the house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As unemployment grows and as more <span class="highlight">male</span> breadwinners find themselves trapped, as it were, back at home in a situation to which they are unaccustomed with small children under their feet hour after hour- these people are low in self-esteem because of lack of employment and are frustrated- they will take out their frustrations on the small children who are under their feet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is granted five years earlier than the age pension to a veteran who has served in a theatre of war, has reached the age of 60 years if a <span class="highlight">male</span>, or 55 years if a female, or has become permanently unemployable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In relation to an allied veteran the specific requirements he will have to meet are that he- served as a member of a formally raised force; served in a theatre of war; resided in Australia for at least 10 years; satisfies the income test applicable to Australian and British Commonwealth veterans; and reached 60 years of age if a <span class="highlight">male</span> or 55 years if a female or become permanently unemployable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister agree that such a scheme has merit and might be a convenient way of eliminating the anomaly whereby men receive age pensions at 65 years and women at 60 years, even though the life expectancy of a female is much greater than that of a <span class="highlight">male</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Another major influence on the participation of women in senior levels in the Service is that the average length of service of female officers is significantly less than that of their <span class="highlight">male</span> counterparts, reflecting in part the higher resignation rates of female officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Possibly it could be argued that there is some discrimination against men insofar as a <span class="highlight">male</span> dependant of a deceased female veteran does not receive the same benefits, not as high benefits, as a female dependant of a deceased <span class="highlight">male</span> veteran. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
