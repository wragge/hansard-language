    <p>If we look at that 9-point formula to which the Commonwealth has adhered and which it persuaded the Commission to adopt, we see that it contains, among other things, a provision that to merit equal pay the work performed by females must be the same or substantially the same as that performed by males under the same award; that the work must have the same range and volume as work performed by males; and that it must be performed under the same conditions as that done by males, lt is also provided that females must be doing work which is not usually performed by females unless a corresponding classification applies to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The one and only satisfactory method of providing a fair and just pension is to adopt the policy enunciated by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  during the 1969 election campaign - that is, that the pension should be 25 per cent of the average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The results are representative of 2,180,000 fulltime adult <span class="highlight">male</span> employees whose normal hours of work are 30 or more a week and who were paid for their full normal hours of work for the payperiod which included 12th May 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-44-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The level of this ratio is affected by the factthat the proportion of females in lower paid occupations is greater than that for males, and that overtime and over-award payments constitute a higher proportion of <span class="highlight">male</span> than of female earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The results are representative of 2,213,000 fulltime adult <span class="highlight">male</span> employees whose normal hours of work are 30 or more a week and who were paid for their full normal hours of work during the survey period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-21-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The estimates are based on the assumption that, for the total weekly earnings group in which the average weekly total earnings figure falk, employees are evenly distributed (consideration being given separately to managerial, etc., staff and to all other full-time adult males). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-21-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not have the figures at hand, but I do know that the level is considerably higher than it was a few years ago and that it now approaches the levels which have long operated in European and, since long before that, Asian countries where almost entirely predominantly rural occupations are engaged in by both the <span class="highlight">male</span> and female populations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we accept the- ‘Budget assumption that average weekly earnings  will increase by 9 per cent, the single pension at the new rate will be only 19.7 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings: The married pensioners are in an even worse position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, in the meantime the Labor Party policy provides that the pension should equal 25 per cent of the average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings which at the moment approximates $96 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, if we are concerned about social costs - believe me, I appreciate that the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  is not only aware of them but is genuinely concerned - arising in our community because of the destruction of the nuclear family unit, we also should be concerned about the tremendous social and economic cost of the single unattached <span class="highlight">male</span> in our community and of his particular problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not very encouraging for people who are 65 years of age or more - that is the starting age for a <span class="highlight">male</span> aged pensioner - to be told at 65 or later that they have to wait some 5 or 6 years for a house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A basic pension rate of 25 per cent of average <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings, as the Labor Party advocates, was in fact paid to pensioners more than 3 decades ago in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While presenting the House with some caution about the possible disruption to dispensing services available to the public, I think it is also relevant to recall the evidence given before the Select Committee to the effect that enrolments into pharmacy courses have dropped dramatically in recent years and that there also has been a sharp change to female rather than <span class="highlight">male</span> enrolment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The experience of the industry has been that female pharmacists do not spend many years actively in the profession and this, together with the likely closure of pharmacies, presents us with a potential problem regarding the future ready availability of dispensing services to the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As to the pension rate reaching 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings, it has been pointed out already that with the present rate of inflation in this country and a twice yearly increase of $1.50, pension rates will never reach 25 per cent of average weekly earnings because the inflation rate would have to drop below  7i  per cent per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has said that its first move in that direction will be to increase pensions by $1.50 a week and that thereafter the base rates will be raised by a further $1.50 a week during each spring and autumn session of the Parliament until such time as the pension reaches 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While the proposal to establish a nexus between pension rates and some external index has merit, it is questionable that the planned course of tying pensions to average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings is the most effective way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That all words after That’ be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading the House is of opinion that provision should have been made (a) for the effective period of service to be 6 years, (b) for the concessions granted to single or widowed female members of the Forces without dependants to be granted also to single or widowed <span class="highlight">male</span> members of the Forces without dependants and (c) for amendments to be made to the principal Act in respect of the title to the dwelling-house, unit or lot to enable the serviceman to borrow on second mortgage and give valid security to the lender”. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wilh regard to the provision in the Bill that this concession be granted to single or widowed female members of the forces without dependants, 1 think this is an excellent suggestion, but I fail to understand why the Government did not take the logical further step and include <span class="highlight">male</span> members in the same category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These female members in my opinion are entitled to the concession, but why the difference between sexes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel there should be no discrimination between the sexes as far as this concession is concerned and I ask the Government to extend the Bill’s provisions to include these <span class="highlight">male</span> members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The statistics also show that males tend to marry at an older age than females and that there is not a significant imbalance of the sexes in general. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is also interesting, I think, as a <span class="highlight">male</span> in a <span class="highlight">male</span> assembly, to note that for every 105 males born there are 100 females born, but the death rate among males is much higher than among females. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, by the time, males reach the age of 23 to 24 they still outnumber females though more of them die off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If it proves necessary to increase the twice annual rate of increase in pensions which we are proposing to ensure that pensions do achieve 25 per cent of the average <span class="highlight">male</span> weekly earnings within a reasonable time then that will be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So I do not believe that pensioners have achieved very much towards gaining their promised rate of 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings because the March increase in the minimum wage has not yet been fully felt in increased costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the first place the Bill confirms the Government’s intention to honour its election commitment to increase the standard rate pension twice a year by at least $1.50 a week on each occasion until a pension level equal to 25 per cent of the average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings is achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will be seen from the table that has been incorporated that in 23 years of government the Liberal and Country parties, far from achieving a pension level of 25 per cent of the average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings, never once reached a level so high as 22i per cent and in their last 6 years in office could never even manage a 20 per cent level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst I naturally support my Party’s program, I therefore cannot help feeling that, rather than committing ourselves to means test abolition within 3 years and to a 25 per cent average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings level as soon as possible, the emphasis could perhaps have been better put the other way around. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I explained in this chamber during the Budget debate, a 10 per cent increase in a person’s salary, taking a base salary of $100 increasing to $110 - that is the average <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings today - means that whilst his costs have- increased 10 per cent, what appears to be an increased return in his salary turns out to be not another $10 but only $6.40. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that I am speaking on the same subject as did the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)  but I am quite happy to do that because I believe that there is one area still outstanding which is the single most serious area of social welfare injustice in Australia, and that is the single <span class="highlight">male</span> parent with dependent children, the widower, the divorced or the deserted father. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The single <span class="highlight">male</span> parent usually has a greater earning capacity than has the woman so the general benefit level cannot be applicable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In spite of all the comments from various sources, to my mind these officers, both <span class="highlight">male</span> and female, are genuine and hardworking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is because the New South Wales Parliament has passed laws with respect to incomes that in that State all wage and salary earners, <span class="highlight">male</span> and female, were able to get equal wages and salaries, paid annual holidays, paid long service leave, quarterly cost of living adjustments, sick leave and a great number of other benefits - all done by a Parliament which had the power to pass laws with respect to incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But apparently at some period beyond formal education the habit is to discriminate between males and females. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, the achieving of the objective of raising pensions to 25 per cent of the average <span class="highlight">male</span> weekly earnings is receding because of the vast costs involved due to inflation and the enormous demands on revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This means that a person on an adjusted income of $4,545 per annum or $87.40 a week, which is very much below the average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings, receives a Commonwealth secondary scholarship of the magnificent sum of $15 per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I make a suggestion to the pensions of Australia who are far from happy with the deal that they are presently receiving in view of the fact that the Government promised to increase the rate of pension to 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How far wrong could he be, because the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in his 1972 policy speech promised that he would raise pensions by $1.50 twice a year until such time as the single rate pension reached 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For my constituents it has resulted in increasing prosperity in 1972 and 1973, as instanced by an average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earning of $99 per week for 1972-73. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, because of increasing costs and the fact that the Government has not lived up to its preelection promise to make social security benefits equal to 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings, these people find it impossible to make ends meet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>4) on 11 September 1973 I said that the Australian Government was determined to achieve its goal of a standard rate pension of 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings and, if necessary, the pension increase for the autumn session would be greater than $1.50 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The new standard rate of pension will be 22.57 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings, seasonally adjusted for the December quarter 1973, of $115.20 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, I respond to the taunt of the Minister for Social Security to my Party about its attitude to the Labor Party’s claim for pensions to rise to 25 per cent of the average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings seasonally adjusted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one denies that there has been inflation; but the fact of the matter is that pensions languished between 18 per cent and 19 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings under consecutive Liberal-Country Party governments, whereas pensions are now 22.6 per cent of such earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same is true of average <span class="highlight">male</span> weekly earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us take the other measure that the Government uses - the standard rate of pension as a percentage of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, again, the average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings should be related to the mid-point of the quarter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one does this one comes up with these results: On 15 November 1972 the pension had a real value of 20 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have proceeded more than half way towards our objective of raising the pension rate to 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Indi compared the present situation where repatriation benefit rates are to be tied to 50 per cent of the minimum wage with general social service benefits which are tied to average <span class="highlight">male</span> weekly earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has been most vocal on its decision to tie such benefits to average <span class="highlight">male</span> weekly earnings but with repatriation benefits that procedure is disregarded and such benefits are tied to a minimum wage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the arguments put forward by the employer opponents of equal pay in the 1969 equal pay case was, by implication, that equal pay should not be granted because it would jeopardise the status of the <span class="highlight">male</span> in the family unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw the attention of the honourable member for Hotham, who is no longer in the chamber, to a statement by the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  that this Government stands firm by its commitment to increase pensions twice a year until they reach 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What he does not tell the House is that the figure for the June quarter actually relates to the middle of the June quarter so, he is talking about average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings which applied somewhere about the middle of May, and now it is towards the end of July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Given that nearly 70 per cent of adult full time <span class="highlight">male</span> wage earners in the Australian work force earn much less than average weekly earnings and that an actual income of $6,000 a year is above average weekly earnings, we are excluding the great bulk of people in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the following table sets out the lowest rates of medical and hospital contributions charged by the major fund as a percentage of the Federal adult <span class="highlight">male</span> basic wage and, later, the Federal adult <span class="highlight">male</span> minimum weekly wage in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-11">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Therefore hospital fund contribution rates remained unchanged and when expressed as percentages of Federal adult <span class="highlight">male</span> minimum wage levels, they declined between June, 1972 and August 1974 due to hospital fund contribution rates having remained unchanged during that period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not sure whether this is to confuse but as I see the average <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings rising and, no doubt, the minimum wage rising I wonder how long it will be before the 100 per cent rate repatriation pension reaches 50 per cent of the minimum wage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That basis involves estimating the increase in employment during the year, converting that increase to a <span class="highlight">male</span>-unit basis, and making an assumption about the increase in average weekly earnings per employed <span class="highlight">male</span> unit (22.5 per cent for 1974-75). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-50-91">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It also seems to me to be an acceptance of the proposition that the role of the female is to be nothing more than an apendage of the <span class="highlight">male</span> of the species. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the question of costs, I have been rather surprised by the representations that have been made to me about the unjust treatment of the female- perhaps the <span class="highlight">male</span> also, for that matterwho can be called upon to pay costs in an action that is brought for dissolution of marriage against her consent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Australian society’s views of marriage and practice, notwithstanding the present trend towards equality of <span class="highlight">male</span> and female roles, is I believe that the husband financially in the generality of cases supports his wife, while the wife supports her husband in the home environment, particularly during the childbearing years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That means that the <span class="highlight">male</span> partner to the marriage can live for 12 months with his fancy girl friend and during that time he can even have his washing done by his wife, because the Bill states that there are certain domestic services which the parties can provide one to the other or to each other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Furthermore, I see no reason why the Government should not arrange for the banks, which it has power to do, to take family income into account when granting loans rather than <span class="highlight">male</span> income only, which is the system under which banks and financial institutions operate at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He makes the point proudly that the increase brings the pension up to 24.5 per cent of <span class="highlight">male</span> average weekly earnings, seasonally adjusted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I wish he would tell the full story because as of today, 13 May, when the $5 has not yet been paid to pensioners, the pension which pensioners are now receiving is 21.1 per cent of <span class="highlight">male</span> average weekly earnings, seasonally adjusted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They know full well under this present Government that their pensions will be adjusted twice annually to try to maintain the pension level at 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I often wonder why the honourable member for Hotham so vigorously denies that he is a <span class="highlight">male</span> chauvinist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe it is because he is a <span class="highlight">male</span> chauvinist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will pensioners actually be any better 00 The Minister stated in his second reading speech that the basic pension of $36 per week will represent 24.5 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings in the December quarter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member for Hotham quickly and correctly pointed out, as at the commencement date for the payment of the new rates in May, the pension as a percentage of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings has been reduced to 21.1 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What percentage of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings will the basic penison be in October when inflation is roaring on in this country at the present rate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The table indicates the increases in pensions over the years, firstly in relation to average weekly earnings per <span class="highlight">male</span> unit employed and secondly in relation to the consumer price index. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, it is said immediately that the contract or undertaking of the Government to make that pension payment equivalent to a quarter or 25 per cent of average <span class="highlight">male</span> weekly earnings has been met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the period of time for which the payment of this $36 a week will operate- it will operate up until late September or October- it will not be worth 25 per cent or a quarter of average <span class="highlight">male</span> weekly earnings; it will be worth something like 2 1.5 per cent of average <span class="highlight">male</span> weekly earnings, which is a very significant difference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say this, believing that there would be little chance of contradiction: At the time at which this Government will go to an election the pension payable will not be equivalent to 25 per cent of the then average <span class="highlight">male</span> weekly earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Despite its imperfections, this Bill which seeks to establish a Children’s Commission is a genuine attempt to overcome one of the major social problems arising from a technologically advanced consumer society which claims a high standard of living, therefore requiring a large percentage of its work force, both <span class="highlight">male</span> and female, to participate fully in the production of the goods and services required by the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition will not oppose the legislation because, as the Minister has pointed out, the cost to the patient for a prescription fee will be approximately the same as it was in 1971 when it was last increased by the previous Government; that is to say the prescription fee or charge of $1.50 will approximate one per cent of average <span class="highlight">male</span> weekly earnings now as it did at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will know it is the Government’s objective to lift progressively the standard of living of pensioners by raising the standard rate of pension twice a year until it reaches 25 per cent of seasonally adjusted average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think the second reading speech of the Minister for Tourism and Recreation and Minister assisting the Minister for Social Security claims that the standard pension has reached 25.2 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings, but the Minister did not say that that is based upon figures for the June 1975 quarter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The point I am making is that the Government promised 25 per cent of average <span class="highlight">male</span> weekly earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All pensions will be immediately raised by $1.30 and thereafter, every Spring and every Autumn, the basic pension rate will be raised by $1.50 until it reaches 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in any case this argument about the 25 per cent of average weekly earnings becomes fallacious because the average weekly earnings are defined as the seasonlly adjusted average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst in theory <span class="highlight">male</span> and female earnings in Australia are now equal, there is still a significant difference between average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings and average weekly female earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp),  our shadow Minister for social security so adequately put it yesterday in the debate on the Social Services Bill, the Government has changed its course from aiming to provide as a base for pensions 25 per cent of average weekly <span class="highlight">male</span> earnings to providing increases tied to percentage increases in the consumer price index. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The new allowances comprise a basic allowance equal to the rate of unemployment benefit for such a person, or whatever other benefit he or she qualifies for, plus a training component of $23.40 which is calculated on the basis of 20 per cent of the average <span class="highlight">male</span> award rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of what is now happening, it is extraordinarily interesting to note that the Committee decided nevertheless to reject the welfare approach and did so on the advice of then Department of Labor, which Department recommended not only abandonment of the welfare approach but also that the allowance be based on the average adult <span class="highlight">male</span> award wage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the former Government approved the introduction of its national employment and training scheme it accepted that the full time training allowance should be equal to the average adult <span class="highlight">male</span> award wage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But in addition to the unemployment benefit to which the individual is entitled, a training component equal to 20 per cent of the average <span class="highlight">male</span> award wage is also payable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the full-time training allowance for all adult trainees be equal to the average adult <span class="highlight">male</span> award wage derived quarterly from the Australian Government Statistician’s series “Adult Males- weighted average for Australia of the minimum weekly rates for a full week’s work, excluding overtime, as prescribed in awards, determinations and collective agreements”; and adjusted in the first pay period following the publication of the series for the December, March, June and September quarters; (in December 1973 this was $76.28); <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the same period the minimum adult wage index has increased by 90.8 per cent and the average <span class="highlight">male</span> weekly earnings have increased by 73.8 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Furthermore, it should be noted that: In February 1972, about 30 per cent of unemployed registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service received unemployment benefit, and this had increased to 70 per cent in February 1976; about 70 per cent of <span class="highlight">male</span> recipients at the latest analysis last year were unmarried; some two-fifths were under 21 years; and three-quarters of them had been on benefit for more than one month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest for the consideration of various Ministers in the negotiation of any new agreement that they give special consideration to the position of a person who is eligible to obtain a rental home through the Housing Commission because he is in receipt of 85 per cent or less of the average weekly earnings per <span class="highlight">male</span> unit employed- at present in Queensland this is $135 for a man, his wife and 2 childrenbut who is not allowed to purchase his home because his income has climbed above this figure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>About 70 per cent of <span class="highlight">male</span> recipients at the latest analysis last year were unmarried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the time of the minimum wage case in 1973, when the minimum wage was increased to $60 the going rate in some awards for an adult <span class="highlight">male</span> was $47. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would not have been reasonable to say to a person who was out of work: ‘You have to take a job as a carriage cleaner for $47 a week’, when the minimum wage was $60 although the award rate for an adult <span class="highlight">male</span> carriage cleaner was only $47. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, in 1933, 28 per cent of the <span class="highlight">male</span> work force was employed in the rural sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was asking that the minimum wage for adult males be extended to adult females; I was asking that wage indexation on the minimum wage be introduced and later on the average weekly earnings; I was asking for an increase in the minimum wage; and Treasury was opposing the concept of extending the adult <span class="highlight">male</span> minimum wage to adult females. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be another arena of negotiations, another arena of wage claims which will not be dealt with or which will not be overcome by what the Government sees as some partial success in having people above the average <span class="highlight">male</span> adult wage, which has been indexed by the full 3 per cent, brought into line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The announcement of the Minister for Defence caused officials of several organisations concerned with imbuing young people, both <span class="highlight">male</span> and female, with the same qualities stressed by the Minister to contact me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They stress that their organisations cater for hundreds of thousands of young people from all sections of the community, not a mere 42 000 young males who attend our more affluent private schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In all 42 000 young <span class="highlight">male</span> students will be covered, and a large proportion of those will come from our more affluent private schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the 5 years from 1971 to 1976-the period to June 1973 can largely be identified with the present Government in its then period of office from 1971 to 1972- <span class="highlight">male</span> employment, which is the major part of total employment in Australia, rose from 2 924 000 to 2 940 000-an increase of about 16 000 or something like  2  per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Finer Report, the report of a community on one-parent families in the United Kingdom in July 1974 found that even at the level of disposing of everyday chores and despite the degree of merger between the traditional roles of <span class="highlight">male</span> and female which has taken place in the last decade, many household tasks still tend to be allocated sexually. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the 2 years to the December quarter 1974, real <span class="highlight">male</span> award wage rates rose by the staggering figure of 1 6 per cent Bearing in mind that the long-term annual average is approximately 3 per cent, it is evident that the equivalent of a little over 5 years normal growth in real award wage rates was crammed into two. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The figure is pretty constant, and the rather alarming thing is that the only plus is an increase in female employment greater than the decline in <span class="highlight">male</span> employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be a more appropriate exercise for the honourable gentleman to ask himself and his colleagues why they still continue to prosecute the case for full wage indexation in Australia, because it is the high level of wages that has effectively priced many Australian workers- <span class="highlight">male</span> and female, young and old- out of jobs in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Gill figures reveal the situation only with regard to males but in the past few weeks a project conducted by four Melbourne students under the control of a professional social worker entitled ‘A Study of Homeless Women in Melbourne’ has unveiled a crisis in Melbourne that the nature of the homeless women problem generally has hidden from society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is indeed a question which we should all consider carefully and seriously, but the point that I want to make above all other points is that this legislation would not have my support- would not have my vote- if it did anything to restrict the right of the Australian citizen, <span class="highlight">male</span> or female, to follow a particular cause in any corner of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One implication of great importance is that any increase in price offered in a market- in this case the wages of female labour- is likely to attract a greater supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has thus witnessed a massive rise in female participation in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the positions they occupy correspond to those which would have been held by young people, both <span class="highlight">male</span> and female who, in earlier periods would have entered the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most income earners, most full-time, adult, <span class="highlight">male</span> wage earners in the work force are getting $ 1 80 a week or less which means that simply by supporting a wife and two children they have to try to make ends meet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-35-2">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a clear indication, particularly in the <span class="highlight">male</span> employment figures, of a significant and magnificant, I suggest, reduction in unemployment as a result of the increasing job opportunities in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, female employment was again stronger than <span class="highlight">male</span> employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>b) The highest proportion of seasonally adjusted average weekly earnings per employed <span class="highlight">male</span> unit reached by the standard rate of pension between the March quarter 1970 and the June quarter 1 979 was 24.00 per cent; the lowest was 17.5 percent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-31-12">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Based on the latest available figure for seasonally adjusted average weekly earnings per employed <span class="highlight">male</span> unit ($231.40 in the June quarter 1979), the information sought by the honourable member is: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-31-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is granted five years earlier than the age pension to a veteran who has served in a theatre of war, has reached the age of 60 years if a <span class="highlight">male</span>, or 55 years if a female, or has become permanently unemployable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to an allied veteran the specific requirements he will have to meet are that he served as a member of a formally raised force; served in a theatre of war; resided in Australia for at least 10 years; satisfies the income test applicable to Australian and British Commonwealth veterans; and reached 60 years of age if a <span class="highlight">male</span> or 55 years if a female or has become permanently unemployable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The comparison for that period is made between academic salaries, including the salaries of high school principals in New South Wales, and average weekly earnings, the consumer price index, weighted average minimum weekly rates of pay for both <span class="highlight">male</span> and female- Federal and Stateand for Commonwealth Public Service salaries and basic salaries for Commonwealth senators and members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-32-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Weighted average minimum weekly rates of pay for <span class="highlight">male</span> and female, both Federal and State, were of a similar order- some 80 per cent to an 83 per cent increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-32-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The McMahon Liberal-National Country Party Government extended the allowance so that where the <span class="highlight">male</span> partner was over 65 years of age but the wife under 60, she received the rate of pension payable had she been over 60.

    <p>Unless she can go before an officer of the Department of Social Security who is quite likely to be a young <span class="highlight">male</span>- and I say ‘quite likely’ because that is a SO per cent chance with an assessment officer- and proves that the conditions under which she was employed were intolerable to her personally- and, I would suggest, it is not unusual; that it does happen that girls are taken advantage of- she has to take the choice of whether she will put up with the indignities of maintaining her employment under those circumstances or suffer the further and doubtful indignities of trying to prove to an officer in an abstract situation that she has been treated in a way which probably would have criminal implications if it could be proved in court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think there is a tendency for them to get involved in what we consider to be illegal behaviour whether it be the drug use which we were talking about this afternoon in another connection, prostitution, both <span class="highlight">male</span> and female, or all kinds of other unpleasant things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
