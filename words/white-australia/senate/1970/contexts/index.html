<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact that the Prime Minister recently stated in Asia that to all intents and purposes, the former policy, commonly referred to as the <span class="highlight">white Australia</span> policy is dead and buried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration have stated in South-East Asia that the <span class="highlight">white Australia</span> policy is officially dead? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many people in the Australian Labor Party who will stand up and complain about  Mr Gregory  being refused entry to Australia but who, if he came to this country, would say that because of the colour of his skin and the <span class="highlight">white Australia</span> policy he should not have been allowed to come here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But 1 did not ever hear them complain when Sergeant Gamboa was being kept out because of his racial origin, and I did not ever hear them complain when  Mrs O’Reilly  was being kept out because of the <span class="highlight">white Australia</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third case that I raise is appropriate to the statement made by no less a person than the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  a few days ago that the <span class="highlight">white Australia</span> policy cannot be justified on moral grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But because he is of Chinese descent, the <span class="highlight">white Australia</span> policy and all the immigration bars that one could think of are applied to him.I respectfully request that each of these three cases be reviewed and justice granted to each of the three persons concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it will back up my submission that the Australian policy on immigration is still a <span class="highlight">White Australia</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 want to refer to one other thing before I leave what I believe is the <span class="highlight">white Australia</span> policy of the Liberal-Country Party coalition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take that to is logical conclusion and let people say: ‘Well, that is fair enough; this country should or should not have a <span class="highlight">White Australia</span> policy’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I was in the Labor Party- I moved for the abandonment of the <span class="highlight">White Australia</span> policy at Labor Party conferences . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-113-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the years its members were the people who talked about <span class="highlight">white Australia</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They wanted a <span class="highlight">white Australia</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Years ago my Party, before anybody else thought of doing so in this country, abandoned the concept of a controlled immigration policy being known as a <span class="highlight">white Australia</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aborigines, I draw attention to the fact that Opposition senators are trying to gain political capital by saying that the ‘Government is bad and is racist and that they, who have seen the light of a <span class="highlight">White Australia</span> policy only a year or two ago, are the purists now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were only about 15 years ahead of the Labor Party in advocating the abandonment of the <span class="highlight">white Australia</span> policy and things of this nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have argued with Japanese friends who have queried our immigration policies and have wrongly designated them as a <span class="highlight">White Australia</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lately the Prime Minister has been in Asia making statements that he and he alone has buried the <span class="highlight">white Australia</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say this clearly and categorically; the <span class="highlight">White Australia</span> Policy is under no challenge in this Parliament or in this country, except by bad administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to be hoped that we can avoid that sort of experience in our country, but I wonder whether we can when I hear honourable senators opposite and when I read the outmoded and outdated attitudes expressed in the other place by people who hitherto slavishly wedded themselves to the <span class="highlight">white Australia</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In another document which the National <span class="highlight">White Australia</span> Policy League has sent to us all there is reference to the ‘Stalinistic formula’ in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are lots of people who have various views on this matter and it was until only recently that the <span class="highlight">white Australia</span> policy operated in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the reasons they stopped coming here, one of the reasons it became almost impossible to obtain immigrants from Western Europe and one of the reasons the previous Government stretched the <span class="highlight">White Australia</span> Policy to include Turks was because it could not get people to come here from countries such as Austria, West Germany and other parts of Western Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 1974 Senate Election a number of persons enrolled under such names, including <span class="highlight">White Australia</span>’ and ‘StopAsianImmigrationNow’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President,  the only thing I would say about  Senator Baume-  very few words are required to deal with what he said- is that this long panegyric upon the drug companies and this rather garbled version of the history of social development whereby credit for the eradication of whooping cough, measles, the slave trade and the <span class="highlight">white Australia</span> policy can be given to the private drug industry, interesting and inaccurate though it may have been, have absolutely no bearing on the legislation which is before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Keeffe  pointed out, <span class="highlight">white Australia</span> has a sorry history in terms of our relations with the indigenous people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The blood of Aboriginal people is on our hands and on the hands of past generations of white Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since that time these causes have been identified, recognised and wiped out within the whole of Western Europe, the United States and <span class="highlight">white Australia</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have also written this book in order to bring <span class="highlight">White Australia</span> to some greater compassion through understanding and to enlighten it to its responsibilities in the areas of land and compensation for Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">White Australia</span> has come a long way since Governor Philip met his first aborigines, ls not Black Australia also entitled to some advancement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the aim of this suggested advance must not be to blend <span class="highlight">white Australia</span> with black. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>assimilation of Aborigines into <span class="highlight">white Australia</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">White Australia</span> policy is long dead, that our immigration policy today is totally nondiscriminatory and is applied consistently to all applicants regardless of race, colour, nationality, descent, national or ethnic origin and sex. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware of allegations arising from that program that the recently suspended  president  of the New South Wales Liberal Ethnic Council, Lyenko Urbanchich, is a former Nazi collaborator, is on the Yugoslav list of wanted war criminals and currently argues in favour of a <span class="highlight">White Australia</span> policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
