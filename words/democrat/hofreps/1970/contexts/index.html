<ul>
  <li>
    <p>As I represent the electorate in which the Brisbane abattoir is situated I ask: Has the Minister seen reports of a claim made in the United States Congress by  Mr J.  Melcher,  a <span class="highlight">Democrat</span>, that Australian meat was dirty? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am glad we have heard that sincere though misguided <span class="highlight">democrat</span>, the honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant)  tell us of some of his beliefs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he is going to hold himself up as the great <span class="highlight">democrat</span>, let him be consistent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem with people getting up and posing as great democrats is that they are very rarely consistent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But on Wednesday night we saw the difference between a <span class="highlight">democrat</span> and one who poses as one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he is going to be a <span class="highlight">democrat</span> he should not be a demagogue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he is going to pose as a <span class="highlight">democrat</span> he should be consistent and have some respect for the society in which he lives and for the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Later in the article the writer in referring to rebels mentions the honourable member for Lilley  (Mr Kevin Cairns),  that great <span class="highlight">democrat</span> the honourable member for Macarthur  (Mr Jeff Bate),  the honourable member for Casey  (Mr Howson)  and the honourable member for Ballaarat  (Mr Erwin). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As K found in all of Kafka’s writings, he was shuttled from minor official to minor official, always skirmishing on the periphery but never really quite reaching the heart of where the decisions were made, never quite reaching where he should be entitled to reach as a citizen within a democratic society, to put his case for his rights within a society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has the right to establish that he is an individual, that this is a democratic society and that no bureaucracy and no person has a right to take these privileges from any individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Immigration  (Mr Lynch),  the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  or any other Minister in the Government - not even that great <span class="highlight">democrat</span> who looks after the Department of External Territories - has not a right to deprive a person of citizenship in this country if he meets normal requirements and standards which are not regarded as illegal if they are held by other Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where they are rejected there ought to be a tribunal to which these people can make a public appeal, so that they can exercise democratic rights, otherwise the expression is an empty slogan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a disreputable and contemptible thing that is for a man who calls himself a <span class="highlight">democrat</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our amendment, which gives all political parties, including the Country Party, equal opportunities to advance their points of view, should be warmly embraced bv every honourable member who likes to think that he is a <span class="highlight">democrat</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today we witness in public the spectacle of this once great Party bickering in a way that to some extent confounds us but at the same time distresses every true <span class="highlight">democrat</span> in the place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask this House today to debate this issue that the honourable member for Lilley has raised, to place the facts before the Australian people and to let them know that these smearing and innuendo tactics have no place in our public life and that the type of legislation and restrictions that the Liberal Party would seek to force on the Australian people must be rejected and opposed by every <span class="highlight">democrat</span> in the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The agitator, the malcontent, the anti-<span class="highlight">democrat</span>, shouts his opponents down with slogans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The genuine <span class="highlight">democrat</span> submits to a constituted authority even though he dislikes most of its representatives and believes that most of their decisions are mistaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parliamentarians from both sides of the fence, Republicans and Democrats alike, have condemned the barbarism and the action of the United States Government, whether it be a <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> or Republican administration, in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would think that Government supporters at least would examine their guilt, as members of Congress in the United States, both Republicans and Democrats, did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those members were critical of the Administration - whether it was a <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> Administration or a Republican Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Premier of Queensland, that notable, militant social <span class="highlight">democrat</span>, felt that Opposition members were being very remiss and irresponsible when we went up there and talked about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least 1 am a <span class="highlight">democrat</span> who believes that people count for more than cows, sheep or horses, and that numbers of people is the significant feature in democratic decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister is working on the theory that it is better to deny them a vote and be certain that the majority will not vote against him in preference to giving them democratic justice, and a say in the election of their Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Harold Wilson - a true <span class="highlight">democrat</span> - went to the polls in 1970 when 18 to 20-year-olds voted for the first time and was defeated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>had made it clear to the committee recommending the proposal that there was no constitutional power to bring in such legislation as was passed in West Germany by the Christian <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> Government there, 20 years ago or thereabouts <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this not a way which the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory, an alleged <span class="highlight">democrat</span> - I would concede that he is - would agree was the proper way for the hypothecation of expenditure, or does he want it to be hidden away, with bureaucrats and officers making decisions, giving directions and spending money without the Parliament knowing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a liberal <span class="highlight">democrat</span>, I can assure him that we will all miss him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A period of 3 hours 23 minutes was allowed for discussion in the Committee stage as against an average time of 1 hour 22 minutes which this great <span class="highlight">democrat</span> supported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great social reformer, the great <span class="highlight">democrat</span> who moved the motion to suspend the Standing Orders, the honourable member for Hotham, when Leader of the House put General Business at the bottom of the notice paper and we never got a vote on it at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why did not some <span class="highlight">democrat</span> opposite move that we sit on Saturday, Sunday and Monday? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why did not some <span class="highlight">democrat</span> opposite move that we sit on Saturday, Sunday and Monday? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Democratic Labor Party in Queensland - in Brisbane anyway - is distributing a paper called “The <span class="highlight">Democrat</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for McMillan  (Mr Hewson)  is a real <span class="highlight">democrat</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member has become a real <span class="highlight">democrat</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member suggesting the reforms is one of those great democrats who got 10 per cent of the Australian votes at the last couple of elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a dreadful argument for a <span class="highlight">democrat</span> to bring forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely if the people want 2 Liberals, 2 Labor members or 2 Democratic Labor Party members and they vote that way they are entitled to have them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member has become a real <span class="highlight">democrat</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He knows full well that he never sought reform to bring about democratic practices until he sat in opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has only become a <span class="highlight">democrat</span> since he has sat in opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is a reformed <span class="highlight">democrat</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am a reasonable man, but you can understand how I have been roused tonight by this new-found <span class="highlight">democrat</span> in our midst. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who reads through the list will see that the one who leads it is the great <span class="highlight">democrat</span> who attacked me tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely no <span class="highlight">democrat</span> can oppose this proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that from the time this Federal Labor Government was democratically elected by the people of Australia, the backward Premier of Queensland has done nothing but attack it and make statements saying that he would not support any measures which come from this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is a great <span class="highlight">democrat</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No wonder the great <span class="highlight">democrat</span> who has just spoken does not want a change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister holds himself out as a great <span class="highlight">democrat</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am informed by a reliable authority that the great <span class="highlight">democrat</span>, the Premier of Queensland, has told councils in that State that should they receive any direct financial assistance from the Australian Grants Commission, there will be a corresponding reduction in the amount of financial aid which they receive from the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely that is not the distinguished <span class="highlight">democrat</span> whom I heard a few moments ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one who is a <span class="highlight">democrat</span>, I hate to see the Deputy Leader of the Opposition threatening us with action in another place, unless we give way here on certain of our proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That great <span class="highlight">democrat</span>, the Premier of Queensland, as I understand it, has told local government authorities that if they accept assistance from the Australian Government their State Government assistance will be reduced correspondingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That great <span class="highlight">democrat</span> - the Premier of Queensland,  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  - has told local government that it has  to  make up its mind whether it is going to accept finance from the Australian Government or the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some attacks were made on the role of the Senate by none other than the great selfproclaimed <span class="highlight">democrat</span>, the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been reelected on a fair and democratic basis and it has been re-elected with a job to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This week we had the incredible situation in which the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  who I notice now describes himself as the head of Australia’s social <span class="highlight">democrat</span> government- whatever that might be- tell the world what Australia will do with its resources, while back home in Australia there is almost total ignorance of our own resources policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Of course, he did not consult the Minister for Defence  (Mr Barnard)  on this issue but he did consult that well-known <span class="highlight">democrat</span>, the Premier of New South Wales,  Sir Robert  Askin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The most undemocratic statement he ever made was: ‘Run the bastards over’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that great <span class="highlight">democrat</span> who leads Queensland hopes that his 1 9 per cent of the vote will continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure them that under the democratic proposals of the present Whitlam Government such a state of affairs will never happen in the Federal arena where people will have to get the majority of the votes to get the results that are necessary in any democracy, and that is democratic majority rule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am ashamed that a man who says that he is a social <span class="highlight">democrat</span> should be supporting these countries of which only one- the Lebanon- is remotely democratic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have always believed as a good <span class="highlight">democrat</span> that the pen should be mightier than the sword but when the pen begins to be used as a sword we are destroying the freedom that the Press claims to want to have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a laughing matter too- that you would call yourself a <span class="highlight">democrat</span>! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can any <span class="highlight">democrat</span> object to that kind of procedure? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope to God the day comes that when this sort of statement is made by a socalled social <span class="highlight">democrat</span> it is hammered at by everybody in the community and that the person who makes the statement is shown up for what he is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment they are talking about doing something which I, as a <span class="highlight">democrat</span>, regard as being quite repugnant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us hear the words of this famous <span class="highlight">democrat</span>, the Leader of the Opposition, who just spoke, demanding that the people’s voice be heard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us hear the words of the <span class="highlight">democrat</span> who sits opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a disturbing spectacle for any <span class="highlight">democrat</span> to observe that the Liberal Party with 3 248 000 votes or 42 per cent of the total votes can gain 68 seats in this House while the Australian Labor Party with 64 868 more votes than the Liberal Party, with a total of 3 313 000 votes or 42.8 per cent of the total, can gain only 36 seats in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not know the difference between a <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> and a Geeveston Fanny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He had a speech written for him by that other leading <span class="highlight">democrat</span>,  Sir Robert  Menzies as he now is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose it is a pointless exercise, but I believe that I am a true <span class="highlight">democrat</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I come to a point which I believe, as a <span class="highlight">democrat</span>, is a matter of considerable principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a <span class="highlight">democrat</span> I will accept their decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember meetings at which the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth), Mr Jack  Kane- that other leading <span class="highlight">democrat</span> from New South Wales- and I were on the same platform, or almost the same platform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  President  brings to the search for a lasting peace the highest intellectual qualities of any American  President  since another southerner and <span class="highlight">Democrat</span>, Woodrow Wilson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>BARBER, Janice Ann- Australian <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No Liberal member, no other National Country Party member and no Australian <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> member in either House voted with us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot see why any person who regards himself as a true <span class="highlight">democrat</span> would prevent discussion of political issues in the period coming up to an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us face it: Elections are the actual exercise of a democratic process and should not be interfered with by this kind of paternalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How the Liberal Party chooses its office bearers is a matter for it, but it must be a matter of deep concern to every <span class="highlight">democrat</span> in the Liberal Party- there are some- and certainly to all democrats in Australia when, bearing in mind the allegations against  Mr Urbanchich, Mr Urbanchich  stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
