<ul>
  <li>
    <p>At the same rime as they are doing this Prince Souvanna Phouma, who was a Social <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> in the old French tradition and who was fighting his half brother Prince Souphanouvong, has said that he is still prepared to meet his half brother while the war continues on the Plain of Jars in an effort to negotiate for peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I advise him to examine the records of the visit to Australia of that great <span class="highlight">democrat</span> Air Vice-Marshal Ky. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the inhabitants of the Australian Capital Territory do not want to acknowledge what has been done by Liberal-Country Party governments and if they wish to persist in saying that Australia would be governed better by an Australian Labor Party government, I - and I think I am a fair <span class="highlight">democrat</span>– am prepared to acknowledge their right to say so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If any <span class="highlight">democrat</span> were io allow such a challenge to succeed he would be helping to destroy the very basis of his democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those honourable senators who do not believe me are, 1 would suggest, not democrats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think  I  can always talk, my friends, just to get back to this one thought: unless the Governors of the state,  I  don’t give a hoot whether a <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> or Republican is in this kind of a job, we are Americans, in the Federal Government, unless we can cooperate on the basis of understanding of the facts and progress steadily, surely and confidently in carrying out a program that we believe will establish the security of the United States, not only from a bomb, from some kind of destructive action of the enemy, but make sure that its surpluses are carried abroad and in return for those surpluses we get back goods that will allow those people to buy our surpluses; unless we have that kind of economic strength we are going to have to live a very different kind of life than we do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Vice-President Agnew was the star performer in the campaign for law and order and he campaigned very vigorously against people such as Adlai Stevenson III, a former Marine Corps officer who was the Democratic Party candidate for United States senator from the State of Illinois; against  Mr Tunney,  the Democratic Party candidate for the Senate in California; and against many other eminent Americans who have been opposed to the Vietnam war and who have supported the civil rights movement in the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result of the law and order campaign in the United States was a repudiation of the policies which have become identified’ with the name of Vice-President Agnew, to such an extent that the Republican Party analysts have now concluded that, in those States where Agnew went with his law and order campaign, far from benefiting his own party he benefited the Democratic Party, so that even in the conservative State of Illinois the seat which had been held by the former Republican leader in the Senate,  Senator Dirksen,  was won by a liberal <span class="highlight">Democrat</span>, the son of the former Democratic Party Presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a person uses the argument here to justify the strike of industrial power for some cause in which somebody believes then he must of course, if he is a <span class="highlight">democrat</span>, support the right of others to do exactly the same thing for a cause which is near and dear to his heart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-113-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet persistently, throughout the years that Prince Souvanna Phouma, a Social <span class="highlight">Democrat</span>, has been in power in Laos, he has maintained that Communist China should be admitted to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a part of the democratic process in this country that minority parties have their say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any true <span class="highlight">democrat</span> will acknowledge that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact, he could even have gone back to the previous government in Chile which was more of a Christian <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> character as distinct from a socialist government, although I know that there are degrees of socialism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 4th June 1971 - over a year ago - that distinguished <span class="highlight">democrat</span>,  Mr Whitlam,  spoke to the ABC Staff Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that there is very much in those 6 points to which any <span class="highlight">democrat</span> could take reasonable exception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that  Senator Byrne,  as a <span class="highlight">democrat</span>, should support me in this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The picture becomes a little muddy when we consider the views of that great Queensland <span class="highlight">democrat</span>,  Mr Bjelke-Petersen,  who, as we know, is under slightly more pressure from the activities of the League of Rights, who went to the extent of having this organisation investigated and who is on record as having said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same publication, in a further reference to the Attorney-General, quotes a question asked by another great <span class="highlight">democrat</span> of this institution,  Senator Little,  who I am sorry to see is not in his seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a <span class="highlight">democrat</span> I concede to them the right - if 1 did not concede it to them they would take the advantage of saying it anyhow - to say what they wish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Democratic Labor Party have always been prepared to dish it out, but we take it and we take it without squealing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I trust that in the interests of labour relations in this country the appointees will carry out their duties as well as members of the Democratic Labor Party who have been appointed to similar positions have carried out their duties in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Queensland the Country Party, led by this great <span class="highlight">democrat</span> Bjelke-Petersen, can poll less than  20  per cent of the total vote and win  26  of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sent himself here as a <span class="highlight">democrat</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have exchanged a good deal of correspondence with  Senator Jackson  who might be deemed a middle of the road <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> from the State of Washington. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely any person who claims to be a <span class="highlight">democrat</span> will agree that union officials ought to be elected only in properly supervised ballots, and that those ballots which are open to rigging ought to be properly supervised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But he made the allegations that he did about Lee Kuan Yew and the state of affairs in the government of his country, and suggested that Lee Kuan Yew was no <span class="highlight">democrat</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This representative of the ABC said: ‘Now, is that not very undemocratic?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should appeal to the heart of any <span class="highlight">democrat</span> that he is given the opportunity, through the safety of these plush red seats, to issue a protest and a challenge that may well result in benefit to courageous people many thousands of miles away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wright,  the great <span class="highlight">democrat</span>, tried to say that the Prime Minister had ratted on undertakings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Greenwood, the great <span class="highlight">democrat</span> who has refused the Leader of our Party leave to do something in the Senate on more than one occasion, will keep. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was a left wing social <span class="highlight">democrat</span> closely associated with the Independent Labor Party in Great Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that while all of us welcome the relaxation in tension between the Soviet Union and the U.S.A., we should be very cautious lest a consequence of such a relaxation could be a division of spoils between 2 super powers with neither of which democratic people have a great deal in common. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is something to which any <span class="highlight">democrat</span> must be opposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Being a <span class="highlight">democrat</span> I always had thought that these decisions were to be taken by the duly elected government but apparently that is a thought which does not commend itself to honourable gentlemen opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any man who votes against allowing the people to vote on the proposition which the elected Government wishes to put to them can hardly claim to be a <span class="highlight">democrat</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those people who call themselves democrats and those who are members of the Opposition are trying to prevent the Government from putting it to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the <span class="highlight">democrat</span> on the other side of the House,  Senator Wood,  would find it hard in his own mind to deny us the right to go to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No <span class="highlight">democrat</span> can object to a procedure whereby the people will make the decision if a conflict exists between 2 Houses equally entitled to claim that they are democratically elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No <span class="highlight">democrat</span>- I know that there is a vaunted claim by members of the Government that they are virtually the only democrats in Australiashould challenge any course of action which enables the people themselves to decide what are the merits of legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the ethics that are paraded by the Opposition as those of a great <span class="highlight">democrat</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a democratically elected chamber does it, and when it will submit itself to the people to have its conduct judged, why should any <span class="highlight">democrat</span> cavil at what is being done? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some attacks were made on the role of the Senate by none other than the great selfproclaimed <span class="highlight">democrat</span>, the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been reelected on a fair and democratic basis and it has been re-elected with a job to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many respects Norman Kirk can be regarded as a man who was a model social <span class="highlight">democrat</span>, a man who stood for parliamentary democracy, for orderly processes of law at the same time coupled with the alleviation of the conditions of the people of his country and of other countries with which his country came into association, not by warlike, aggressive or belligerent actions but by cooperation and by entering into a peaceful social contract. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the words of  Mr Whitlam,  this is the first social <span class="highlight">democrat</span> government of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Senator Withers, with all the erudition which befits the Leader of the Liberal Party in the Senate, said ‘I thought you were a democratic socialist’, which, of course, is the same thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The terms ‘social <span class="highlight">democrat</span>’ and ‘democratic socialist’ are the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assure  Senator Withers  that the words ‘social <span class="highlight">democrat</span>’ and ‘democratic socialist’ have precisely the same meaning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So this great <span class="highlight">democrat</span> who bemoans the failure of the Constitutional Convention because his view as an Opposition member was not acceptable to the rest of the Senate and who has helped increase instability in Australian politics for years to come, is now trying to find an excuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Baume  adopted the very respectable and proper view that it is the democratic right of an elected government to implement its policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a true individual <span class="highlight">democrat</span>  Senator Baume  put forward that point of view in the Senate and I think the whole chamber should be reminded of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may seem odd that a radical social <span class="highlight">democrat</span> party such as ours should appeal so unashamedly to the precedent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the statement of a <span class="highlight">democrat</span> in the great Liberal Party tradition, as the Party once was or was claimed to be in the days of  Sir Robert  Menzies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When in a democracy should a <span class="highlight">democrat</span> cavil at the people’s judgment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is disappointing to me that the members of a party, which for some extraordinary reason calls itself the Liberal Party, in this House will follow the instructions of this group and will obey the call of those who attempt to defeat this democratically elected government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those of us who were reactivated politically, if that is the word, in the 1960s by the gross distortions of view which were presented then, who saw this country dragged through the shambles of Vietnam and who saw that everyone who professed to be a social <span class="highlight">democrat</span> or a democratic socialist was labelled a communist by people such as Senators Carrick and Greenwood, were dismayed with what we saw and heard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be pertinent to mention that right throughout the debate there were presentin the chamber  Mr Martyr,  the honourable member for Swan, who was the secretary of the Democratic Labor Party in Western Australia in 14 years, and the other fanatical <span class="highlight">democrat</span>,  Mr Wentworth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Larry O’Brien, a leading <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> campaign director not merely for the late  President  Kennedy but also in the unsuccessful <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> campaigns, in the Nixon era pointed out how in the United States of America the National Broadcasting Corporation and the Colombia Network- in the United States of America there is no government agency to strike a balance- had prostituted that country’s political television shows in favour of the artful dodger, Richard Milhous Nixon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Anybody who is aware of the history of that period would know that Stalin’s slogan was: Scratch a social <span class="highlight">democrat</span> and find a social fascist’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was Stalin who organised the campaign by the German Communist Party in collusion with the German Nazi Party to bring down the social democratic government in Prussia in 1931. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, the only reference that I can remember about brothers- and it was certainly not the remark that  Senator Lajovic,  this latter-day Haldane, attributed to Stalin, that social democrats and communists are twin brothers- is the exchange that once took place between Otto Grotewohl. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Grotewohl said to Schumacher: Communists and Social Democrats are really brothers’, to which Schumacher replied: ‘Yes, like Cain and Abel’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to mention first- I think it is important- that this is an expression of Australian <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> policy rather than my own view exclusively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is small wonder that any government- even a <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> government, if there were one under these circumstances- is afraid to say to society: ‘Look, unless we do these things now, at this cost, we will be in bad trouble in 10 years from now’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a <span class="highlight">democrat</span> I believe that the parliament’s authority is given by the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every senator on this side, as on the other side, has a right to be here, be they Liberal, <span class="highlight">Democrat</span>, Independent or Labor, because every senator has gained a sufficient proportion of support from the Australian people: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The then shadow Minister for Social Security and for a short time the caretaker Minister for Social Security, who is now an Australian <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> senator in this place, promised, on behalf of the Government- he has said repeatedly since then that he had the support of both the Liberal and National Country Parties- that pensions would be automatically and immediately indexed to the consumer price index twice yearly and that pensions would be taken out of politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am conscious that standing here, the youngest person to address this chamber for over six decades, I do so in several capacities: Firstly, as an individual- unique I hope, and if not yet worth cloning, at least worth listening to; secondly, as a <span class="highlight">democrat</span> who believes that to govern is to serve; thirdly, as a member of a unique chamber; and, finally, as a Liberal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a <span class="highlight">democrat</span> I regret the imperfections of our political system which are within our power to remedy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While speaking as a <span class="highlight">democrat</span>, I wish to pause to comment upon the role of the Press in our system of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So I plead with those people in government to realise that excessive secrecy, far from advancing the democratic processes, is in fact potentially destructive of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have many good trade unionists in the Australian Democrats and every day we welcome more as members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing pleases me more than to see ex-activists of the Liberal Party and Labor Party working together amicably and constructively in so many <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> branches because in that process we have a microcosm of a future Australia which operates through the politics of cooperation rather than the present politics which in spite of words to the contrary continue in practice to be confrontative <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to take up the point of area ownership a little further because I believe it is a fundamentally new idea which has come from Australian <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I reinforce my point by saying that this was indicated by a secret written ballot conducted of 6,000 Australian <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> members last year to determine our policy on uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not complaining about that because the Opposition has been remarkably kind to members of the Australian Democrats since we got into this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am just raising in passing the fact that  Senator Mason  and I, as the two Australian <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> senators in this chamber, represent about one million voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government probably will adjourn this debate at the end of my speech because this is an Australian <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> initiative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attractive though it is maybe, for any <span class="highlight">democrat</span> to favour the idea of the people making the decisions, the fact is that it is just no longer possible, if indeed it ever was possible, for the people to be aware of all the factors that are necessary to sensibly determine an issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The success of that policy in Sweden under a social <span class="highlight">democrat</span> government is shown by the fact that that Government has been much better able to withstand the recession that has hit all the Western world countries over the past three or four years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> view that Australia should indulge in foreign adventurism or that we should involve ourselves extensively in a network of alliances that might attract unfavourable attention to us in time of war; but it is certainly the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> view, and I suggest the view of the citizens of this country, that we should be in a position to defend ourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I had not intended to rise again on the Bills, but since  Senator Keeffe  has chosen to make an unspecific statement concerning Australian <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> policy in this regard, I feel that I should stress to him and to other honourable senators that the relevant point of Australian <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> policy is very basic to our Party: It is that this country is a multi-racial society and that, within reason, all Australians should share the same privileges and responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although  Mr Baker  stood as an Australian <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> candidate in 1977, the Australian Democrats are not liable for debts incurred by him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The letter of  Senator Chipp  ‘s Assistant Private Secretary clearly indicates that  Mr Baker  was recognised as an Australian <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> candidate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe there is a moral obligation on the Australian Democrats, as a political organisation and as a political party, to honour a debt incurred in terms of material prepared not only for the promotion of  Mr Baker  as a candidate but for the promotion of  Senator Mason,  who gathered together the 6.6 per cent of the votes that he received in the electorate of Paterson, in amassing the total of votes which brought him, as an Australian <span class="highlight">Democrat</span>, into this Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My constituents, who run the Regency Press as a small private concern, accepted the account of  Mr Baker;  they printed the material in good faith, in the belief that the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> candidate would honour this account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frankly, they cannot afford to carry a debt of $ 1 ,300, which it appears that the Australian Democrats are not prepared to honour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of these economic factors, will the Government now use its influence to persuade the Government of South Australia to support the recently expressed policy of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> Legislative Councillor,  Mr Lance  Milne, to mine copper, gold and rare earths at Roxby Downs and to return the uranium ore to the ground as mine fill, as is being done elsewhere in the world? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to a paper headed ‘<span class="highlight">Democrat</span> Deceit ‘ which states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  explanation for having said that the Democrats, whom he expects will hold the balance of power after 1980, will introduce private member’s Bills to do three things appears to be that, from the Bills that he proposes to introduce, the sections that actually appropriate the money will be omitted and therefore the Bills will not be disqualified by virtue of section 53 of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What he is really saying is that the Democrats propose to introduce meaningless Bills as some sort of a political stunt by which they hope to secure support within the country, without delivering the goods that they have promised to deliver. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
