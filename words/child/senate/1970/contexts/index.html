<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that the Allied forces in Vietnam are prepared to spend about half a million dollars per capita for every Vietnamese man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> they kill, will the Government give further consideration to its proposed payment of a paltry$ 15,000 for relief of victims of the Peruvian earthquake? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister representing the Minister for Social Services inform the Parliament whether <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments are made only to the mother or, where the <span class="highlight">child</span> is not in the custody of the mother, to an approved guardian or an approved institution? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Education and Science aware that, according to recent psychological studies carried out under the sponsorship of the Carnegie Corporation ot the United States of America, half of ali growth in human intelligence takes place between birth and age 4 and a further 30% between age 4 and age 8 or that, in relation to formal education, two-thirds of a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s intellectual development takes place before he even commences  primary  education? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister also aware that for many children, especially children of poverty, lack of intellectual stimulus preordains failure in later life? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for External Territories: Was a 9-year-old Papuan boy sentenced to 6 months gaol on each of 4 charges in the Port Moresby Children’s Court last Friday, and did the magistrate direct that this 2-year sentence be served in Bomana Gaol as there is no reformatory for juvenile offenders? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister take immediate action to ensure that, firstly, this <span class="highlight">child</span> will not be imprisoned for any period in a gaol where he might come into contact with adult criminals and, secondly, arrangements are made for the adequate accommodation and rehabilitation of juvenile offenders in the Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister explain why the striking of one person by another constitutes assault under law except where the victim is a school <span class="highlight">child</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister raise this matter at the next meeting of the Attorneys-General with a view to outlawing this nineteenth century practice and thus ensuring that no <span class="highlight">child</span> is the victim of emotionally unstable schoolmasters? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of statements suggesting that the Government favours more creches and <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres, will the Government consider financing home help facilities to assist mothers who for health or other good reasons need help with young families so that the children can be kept in the home? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>by leave - It gives me great pleasure to announce that the Commonwealth Department of Social Services with the full support and co-operation of the State departments concerned with social and <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare has commissioned a family research project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill amends the definition of ‘<span class="highlight">child</span>’ in the principal Act in order to give effect  to  the extension of eligibility for war pensions to student children between the ages of 16 and 21. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720921_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question refers to the extraordinary happening yesterday where a school and school children in the national capital area were made available for the production of a commercial film of a political character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: As it is specifically admitted that this was a commercial film, will the <span class="highlight">child</span> labour employed in the production be paid the award rate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would think that the honourable senator would imply that the <span class="highlight">child</span> labour should be remunerated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security aware that a family with 4 children would receive <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment of $5.75 a week and yet if, due to divorce, the family were divided into 2 groups with each parent, looking after 2 children, each group would receive only $1.50 a week - a total of $3? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable senators I present the report on the survey of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Migrant Education in Schools of High Migrant Density in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 am sorry if 1 missed, it, but I did not hear any explanation of the inquiry  Senator Greenwood  made as to why the distinction between an adopted <span class="highlight">child</span> and a natural, legitimate <span class="highlight">child</span> is preserved? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I inquire of the Special Minister of State  (Senator Willesee)  whether the law that it was feared might be infringed in the State sphere is the Adoption of Children Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot see why, for the purpose of consenting to a marriage, a parent who has become a parent by adoption is in any position different from the parent of a legal and natural <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the AttorneyGeneral whether he contemplates any action to prevent a repetition of the ordeal imposed upon  Mrs Weber,  whose <span class="highlight">child</span> was abducted to Austria, to ensure that an Australian court ruling in respect of <span class="highlight">child</span> custody remains of paramount importance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730821_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is a Press statement correct that an Aboriginal <span class="highlight">child</span> of about 7 years of age was transported with the assistance of the Commonwealth from her foster parents back to her parents in order that the <span class="highlight">child</span> might be married to one of the older men of her tribe? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the action was taken after some 3 years of requests being made by the parents for the return of their <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister give any information regarding areas of research being developed under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Centre Research Programme, particularly relating to assistance to the States for training courses for staff who will be subsidised under the programme resulting from the Government’s $200,000 research allocation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Before the day is out I shall endeavour to get for the honourable senator information on the training of those engaged in <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that for some time the Government and in particular the Minister for Social Security have been aware of the fact that very great disabilities are imposed on parents of children who need medical attention and cannot obtain it near where they live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no real difference in the disabilities whether it is a <span class="highlight">child</span> or an adult who needs medical attention and has to travel some considerable distance in order to obtain this assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs whether he can inform the Parliament whether it is a fact that the Queensland Aboriginal and Island Affairs Department pays to a single Aboriginal mother approximately only half the allowance paid to similar nonAboriginal mothers by the appropriate State department during the first 6 month period after the birth of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is ongoing departmental monitoring of the effectiveness of the <span class="highlight">child</span> screening and rehabilitation services, and continual team assessment of the treatment of individual cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-71-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One feasible alternative might be to adapt medical record linkage systems, once established, to alert the authorities to cases of repeated injury to the same <span class="highlight">child</span> or to siblings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-101-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) What facilities exist in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory for management of families with a battered <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-101-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are there systems in existence in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory adequate to allow comprehensive reporting of cases of the ‘battered <span class="highlight">child</span> syndrome’; if not, what changes of procedure are planned to make the system of reporting more adequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-101-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the sources of referrals of cases ofbattered <span class="highlight">child</span> syndrome’ in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory and how many referrals in the past five years have come respectively from: (a) general practitioners, (b) dentists, (c) lawyers, (d) hospitals, (e) welfare agencies, (f) police, (g) teachers and (h) others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-101-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there a system for bringing to the attention of authorities cases of the ‘battered <span class="highlight">child</span> syndrome’ occurring in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-101-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That this reduction will impose hardships on many parents who have children attending school, whether nongovernment or government; and particularly on parents with more than one <span class="highlight">child</span> at school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why are grants under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Migrant Education Program as shown in the Minister’s press release of 9 December 1974, made to Roman Catholic, but not to other nonGovernment Schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Migrant Education Program the Australian Government provides special assistance to both Government and non-Government schools to assist migrant children in learning English. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Did a Resolution of the House of Representatives of 13 September 1973 call for the Royal Commission into Human Relationships to include in its terms of reference that the Commissioners should have regard to the United Nations declaration on the rights of the <span class="highlight">child</span>, the sanctity of life and the preservation of human life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My advice is that it is being established under the same powers as applied to the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act which was passed by the Liberal-Country Party Government in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The comments made in respect of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act may be appropriate if the Government wishes to find them consistent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other information that was supplied by  Senator Knight  in relation to <span class="highlight">child</span> care programs, I feel sure, is of assistance and interest to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the duty of the police to assume responsibility for cases of <span class="highlight">child</span> abuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-47-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No separate statistics are kept on the instances of <span class="highlight">child</span> abuse but officers who have been with the Northern Territory Police Force and with the Social Development Branch of the Department of the Northern Territory can recall only two (2) cases, as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-47-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Statutory responsibility relating to matters of <span class="highlight">child</span> bashing and battered babies in the Australian Capital Territory rests with the Police under the provisions of the Crimes Act of New South Wales in its application to the Territory because the act of <span class="highlight">child</span> bashing may well lead to criminal charges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-57-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I cannot follow the reason why a woman cannot claim a supporting mother’s benefit if the <span class="highlight">child</span> is not born in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have consulted UNICEF and other bodies active in promoting the celebration of the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> and I would hope that the announcement to which I have referred will lead to the formation of a committee to undertake this work and to ensure that this Year is celebrated in the community in a way that represents a fitting contribution by Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the National Health and Medical Research Council ever proposed a regulation which would have served to protect women of <span class="highlight">child</span> bearing age or pregnant women against exposure to 2,4,5-T? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister inform the Senate of the position of Australian Capital Territory <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education programs, particularly as to whether adequate numbers of such teachers are available and whether the provision of facilities for teaching English as a second language in the Australian Capital Territory are adequate for migrant children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I shall draw to the attention of the Minister for Health the question raised by the honourable senator and his suggestion that further steps should be taken to see that as many young girls and women of <span class="highlight">child</span> bearing age as possible do have immunisation against rubella because of the disastrous consequences for newly-born children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>One can imagine the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> of a pensioner, because of his or her difficulties, needing to be considered as a student <span class="highlight">child</span> until after the age of 25 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for Social Security: Is it true that children with coeliac disease have been accepted as being eligible for the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance of $15 a week when, in the absence of any other handicap, the only disadvantage they incur is the need to avoid wheat and rye products in their diet in order to enjoy normal health? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister agree that the philosophy behind the original legislation for the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance was to recompense parents of children with handicaps such as cerebral palsy and mental retardation, whose care required both financial effort and effort of time and emotional stress? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat: The purpose of the amendment is to extend a wife’s pension to women who are inmates of approved benevolent homes and also to women who have no <span class="highlight">child</span> in their care, or who are under 50 years of age, where their husband is an inmate of a benevolent home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I feel that this Government is falling down on the essential job of helping the family and of helping to populate this country when it again fails to increase <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, when it leaves maternity allowances at the miserable rates at which they have been for so many years, and when in regard to education it still has not done all it should, although I must be fair and admit that the Government has done a lot in recent years for education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the previous night she had been called out at 2.00 a.m. to an Aboriginal <span class="highlight">child</span>, who was suffering from a painful ant bite (nothing more serious) and whose mother was worried sick because the <span class="highlight">child</span> had screamed for some time before dropping into a sobbing sleep. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The provision of maternity allowances, widows’’ pensions, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, unemployment, pharmaceutical, sickness and hospital benefits, medical and dental services (but not so as to authorise any form of civil conscription). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government does not do this when it is collecting for other social services such as <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, age pensions and the rest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>of the principal Act comes under division 5a which refers to handicapped children in approved handicapped persons homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a benefit payable is  in  respect of handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> care under the present scheme of Si. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>50 for each day  on  which the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> receives handicapped person care in that home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Handicapped children are under a great disadvantage compared with the normal <span class="highlight">child</span> in the Australian community and we believe that the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> should not be further deprived of benefit by having the amount of $1.50 included in an Act of this nature when the general provision for all other sections of the community is $2. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will place the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> at least on the same basis financially as other sections of the community which are receiving benefits under this Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say that it is an important matter which is in the interests of the handicapped children and 1 have therefore moved the amendment on behalf of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore whilst I would always be sympathetic to the needs of the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> I would not be certain in my mind that the payment of $1.50 was the correct way of assisting them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is so much that money cannot provide for the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> - that is in terms of a small benefit or subsidy on behalf of the <span class="highlight">child</span> - and [ would hope that the Commonwealth and the States would be able to develop schemes to assist physically handicapped children which would be much more generous than the payment of$1. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Dame ANNABELLE RANKIN (Queensland - Minister for Housing)[5.7] - Everyone in this chamber is conscious of the sadness of a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone, 1 know, is concerned with what can be done for both the parents and the <span class="highlight">child</span>, and with the future of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This benefit has provided very valuable assistance to the parents of handicapped children and is considered to be adequate in the present circumstances and having regard to the Commonwealth’s overall commitments in the field of health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be noted that where a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> who is covered by hospital insurance receives hospital treatment, the full Commonwealth benefit of $2 is paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, if a <span class="highlight">child</span> is receiving nursing home care and the institution is approved as a nursing home, then the benefits are paid accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The section now under notice refers to the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> who is in a handicapped children’s home where the medical treatment required is not so intensive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our view assistance to the full amount of contributions for standard hospital and medical coverage should be provided by the Commonwealth Government to the head of a family with two dependent children where the family income, exclusive of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, for a defined period, does not exceed the minimum wage payable under Commonwealth awards or the State in which they reside (with appropriate adjustment for assets). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This amount should be reduced by $4 where there is only one <span class="highlight">child</span> and by a further $4 where there are no children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly where there are more than two dependent children in the family the amount should be increased by $4 for each additional <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, as we read it the Nimmo Committee recommended that a person in this category with more than 2 children should be allowed for assessment purposes an additional $4 per week per <span class="highlight">child</span> and would obtain health insurance coverage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under such a proposal a person earning $58.50 with 6 dependent children would be entitled to receive some protection, but under the Government’s proposals once a person’s income exceeds $48.50 he has to find the wherewithal for insurance purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all right to talk about the 55 limit applying to surgery, but the young <span class="highlight">child</span> of a low income earner could get some infectious disease and require the daily visit of a medical practitioner for over a week or so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the Commonwealth bears a large share of the responsibility for looking after handicapped adults - through invalid pensions, its own rehabilitation service, its subsidies to sheltered workshops and in other ways - <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare, broadly speaking, has been a matter for the States and the many admirable voluntary organisations that have so successfully pioneered and carried on their humanitarian work in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government of course provides a subsidy of $1.50 per day in respect of the accommodation away from home of certain handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>disabled it is important that it should ensure that all possible help is given to handicapped people as early as possible because a <span class="highlight">child</span> - even an infant - is easier to train than an adult. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the measures proposed in the Bill  are designed specifically to assist  in  providing facilities for the training of handicapped children, from pre-school onwards, it is not only the children who will benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most honourable  senators will know something of the problems that confront the parents of the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is also on these parents that much of the responsibility rests to establish many of the special schools, training centres and hostels that these children need to enable them to live as normal a life as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No Government could hope to duplicate the type of service that is provided by parents and those who dedicate themselves to supplying the needs of these children because no Government service could supply the love and sympathy and understanding that is every bit as necessary as the classrooms, the play areas and the special equipment that these children require. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless the measures proposed in the Bill will materially help some handicapped children to take their place in the work-force and to join fully in the life of the community; it will help others to enter sheltered employment or al least to become more a part of our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Social Services aware of the heavy erosion through inflation of the real value of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister tell us how a mother depending on <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment copes with the increase in costs through inflation and the fall in the real value of these payments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will she make the strongest representations to the Minister for Social Services and to the Treasurer to obtain a restoration of the real values of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment in the next Budget? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister seen reports that the first Australian science course for primary schools will be introduced in Victoria next year to give primary  school  children a grounding in several branches of science including physics, chemistry and biology? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could  this consideration be undertaken in the light of overseas experience which shows that children in their formative years are able to absorb knowledge al a much younger age than was thought to be the case hitherto? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he agree that studies have shown that the younger a <span class="highlight">child</span> begins to learn another language the easier it is for that <span class="highlight">child</span> to become proficient in it and that the step suggested could be of tremendous benefit to future Australian generations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand, the Government is prepared to spend and is spending a great deal of money making sure that the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> is protected and yet, on the other hand, I read in the ‘Sydney Morning Herald’, this morning, that members of the Liberal Party have asked for an extension of the abortion laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me, I repeat, a contradiction that on one hand the Commonwealth spends money to protect the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> and to make certain, as far as it is humanly possible, that that <span class="highlight">child</span> will be born a normal human being, yet on the other hand it is suggested that these laws should be relaxed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By extension of such laws, we take from the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> the right to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that, as a result of the passage of this legislation, the necessary benefits that we hope the vaccine will produce will be facilitated so that we may make certain that the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> is not denied its right to be born as a normal human being and not be malformed in any way whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures I have just given are by way of illustration and are based on afamilyof husband and wife and would vary if the family included one or more dependent children, or conisisted of  1  parent and a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to draw the Minister’s attention to the definition of handicapped children in clause 4 and to put forward a submission put to me in the hope that in due course it will receive attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The definition reads:  “ handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> “ means a person who is suffering from a physical or mental disability and - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill provides for a $2 subsidy for every $1 subscribed from private or local government funds for capital expenditure on training institutions for handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Organisations do not regard as their real problem the raising of capital expenditure for buildings to help the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tremendous problem is the recurring expenditure, how to pay the specialised staff - the physiotherapist, the speech therapist, the occupational therapist, the psychologist and the nursing staff at these homes and the staff who visit families who have children in need of care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are also the social welfare workers who assist parents in the education of handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister estimates that there are some 50,000 handicapped children in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is only an estimate, for the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  in replying to a question in the House of Representatives in May of this year advised that the number of handicapped children in Australia is not known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the latest figures of the World Health Organisation, Australia has an estimated 300,000 mentally retarded children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These children are divided into 3 categories - mildly, modestly and severely retarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is further estimated that every 78 minutes a <span class="highlight">child</span> is born in this country which falls within one of these categories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe there is one member in this place or one person in the whole of Australia who is not concerned with the problems of mental retardation or the physically handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> or adult. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know it affects every person, who could rightly think ‘There but for the grace of God goes one of our children.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the luncheon adjournment 1 was asked whether I had any personal reasons for being interested in this matter; in effect, whether I had a physically or mentally handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me here express concern for parents who have known the tragedy of a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> and I believe that proper scientific treatment, which should be available, may be able to bring some benefits to these people I mentioned also that  Senator Anderson,  when a member of the New South Wales Parliament back in 1952, moved a motion for adjournment of the Legislative Assembly to debate these problems, and that by so doing he was largely responsible for the provision of teachers for retarded children in New South Wales, and particularly in the area that he represented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was one of the Marcus Welby, M.D., series and portrayed an autistic <span class="highlight">child</span> and the terrifying implications of this complaint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Autistic children pose a grave problem today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is estimated that there are 1,500 autistic children in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might add that there arc twice as many autistic children as blind children, and more autistic children than deaf children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the benefit of some senators who on different occasions have asked what an autistic <span class="highlight">child</span> is, an autistic <span class="highlight">child</span> is a <span class="highlight">child</span> who lives in a world apart, completely divorced from his social, physical and emotional environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is becoming increasingly evident that the earlier the autistic <span class="highlight">child</span> can be diagnosed and helped, the better the chance will be of returning him to society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we can get these children early enough, there is hope that something can possibly be done for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One need only reflect back to one’s early childhood to remember the nasty references we may have made to some children who came along to school who were referred to as dummies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Each of us as a <span class="highlight">child</span> would have been involved in that type of feeling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today there is a greater acceptance of these children, and indeed this measure is again pushing ahead Federal assistance for the first time in attempting to build institutions where they can be housed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I note that the Director General, where he is satisfied that training is provided or proposed to be provided at any premise for handicapped children who, by reason of their handicap, are in need of training for which special facilities are required and that training so provided or proposed to be provided will meet that need, may for the purposes of this Act assist with the training so provided or proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have had some interest over a number of years in this matter as I have been fortunate to have been since 1954 part of the management of the largest school for deaf children in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Victorian School for Deaf Children was some years ago known as the Victorian Deaf and Dumb Society, and the changed name is again an indication that society has changed its views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Victorian School for Deaf Children carries out the ideas which are proposed to be assisted by this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the housing of children these days I am certain that unless there is a love content present among people who are likely to run the organisation the problems that arise for these children in their later life are made even greater by the fact that, because of their affliction, they must be away from their families, lt brings one to realise that the assistance that may flow in future years from this particular measure is not only assistance for the children but, indeed, for a <span class="highlight">child</span> being born with some affliction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, the word does not apply, for instance, if the <span class="highlight">child</span> is injured in a motor accident, but if the <span class="highlight">child</span> is born with some affliction - and this is the point that I wish to mention to the Senate - the assistance flows not only to the parents of the <span class="highlight">child</span> but to the other children who may be within the family or, indeed, to the close relatives and people of the particular family from which the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> comes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Also, they have not given sufficient attention to supplying the facilities necessary for those children who may require special schools for the treatment of their illness, whether they be institutions for deaf children, blind children, spastic children or those who have an autistic problem, as was mentioned by  Senator Fitzgerald,  and certainly those who have multiple sclerosis, who we know need very special care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I had an early interest in these children because very many years ago it was one of my voluntary efforts 1 day a week to take the rubella children to a pre-oral kindergarten run by the State for the purpose of trying to rehabilitate these children into society, so that they could perform useful functions in life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1959, in Geneva, Australia was a signatory lo the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>, Principle 1 of which reads: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we have an obligation for the education and the welfare of the able <span class="highlight">child</span>, we have at least an equal obligation to the disabled <span class="highlight">child</span>, and it should not be a question of a 2 for 1 subsidy to voluntary contributions where schools are provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the <span class="highlight">child</span> who ultimately grows to become an apparently normal adult and then becomes an alcoholic was born with an affliction thai, was not recognisable at the time; little recognition was given to it until it was far too late. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If he asks me to define il, I may have difficulty, but it is the love of parents who I know who have had spastic and even mongol children, and their dedication and refusal to abandon those children to institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some of us, of course, live a lifetime and do nol leave that much behind us; yet a <span class="highlight">child</span> who was born a spastic and died at the age of 7 can be the beginning of erecting a monument that may one day be a credit to mankind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that because, being interested in this problem for a lifetime because of that, 1 questioned recently many parents as to how they stand on some of the more modern ideas of curing some of the other alleged problems that beset mankind and whether they would have preferred never to have a spastic <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that  Senator Fitzgerald  will support me when 1 say that so many of them are still interested long after a member of their own family or their own <span class="highlight">child</span> has passed out of the ambit where they can be assisted or have been assisted to the fullest extent possible and are dedicating themselves to helping others because they have become involved in the problem at (his level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the fact that the Minister could not tell me to whom <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment must be and can be paid, 1 now ask this question: Will the Minister inform the Parliament why schools, persons and hostels in Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia are able legally to collect <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments by a dubious gentlemen’s arrangement with the Department of Social Services and why this arrangement operates only where the mother is an Aboriginal? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I ask this question: As the Government has been so solicitous for the children of  Mrs Biggs  - and I am grateful that it has been because 1 think the children ought to be kept with their mother - why differentiate and say that the children in the Taylor case ought to be kept with their father and that therefore the mother has to go through a life that neither the Minister nor I can envisage? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to refer to an extract from ‘Trends in the Social Situation of Children’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a report on children by the Secretary-General of the United Nations on 8th January 1970 it was stated that there could be 300,000 mentally retarded children in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those children are divided into 3 categories: Mildly, moderately, and severely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was further estimated that every 78 minutes a <span class="highlight">child</span> is born in this country which falls within one of those 3 categories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact I hope that the estimate of the Minister as to handicapped children is correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The undersigned members of the start of this school have taken this unusual step of writing lo you because of the serious situation which is developing in relation to the provision of adequately trained teachers to teach your <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn to the provision in the Budget for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, lt will be seen that $20m less is being budgeted in this financial year than was the case last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Budget merely plugs holes in social services and makes no provision for a comprehensive national insurance scheme or for necessary aid for family life through better <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, maternity allowances, housing, health and education assistance; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My attitude has been that, if it were possible to save $280m, then that sum should have been devoted to the pensioners, to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, to education and to other deserving causes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pressure must be applied to the lid of the container in order to open it, so no <span class="highlight">child</span> under the age of 5 years would possibly be able to open them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some brilliant children might be able to do so, but at least the bulk of them would not be able to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Budget does not make any provision for an increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government had seen fit to do something about increasing <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment instead of reducing the level of personal income taxation on taxpapers in the lower and middle income groups I feel that it would have been more beneficial to the family man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I feel that an increase of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment could have been more beneficial to the family man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that assistance to the people in the lower income bracket by way of increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments would have given them a greater opportunity to better their standard of living than a reduction in their level of personal income taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So far as the Migration Act 1958-1.966 is concerned section 62 makes it an offence to take away from Australia any <span class="highlight">child</span> under the age of 17 years in respect of whom there exists a court order as to custody, guardianship or access or where proceedings have been instituted in an Australian court for the making of such an order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In July 1964, after the circumstances  of  Barry McKenzie’s departure had come to notice, passport procedures were amended to require the production  of  a full birth certificate, which names the parents  of  the <span class="highlight">child</span>, when persons seek to have the names  of  children included in their passports at the time of issue or added subsequently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to this the procedures did not require any documentary evidence of the birth of a <span class="highlight">child</span> to be produced for passport purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to  Dr Henry  Schoenheimer, for the <span class="highlight">child</span> of a professional or senior executive family the chances of obtaining a tertiary education are 18 times higher than those of a <span class="highlight">child</span> with semi-skilled or unskilled parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know a little about this survey because it concerns my own <span class="highlight">child</span> and children of friends of mine, lt has been found that scholarships were going to children of families which could economically afford to send their kiddies through secondary school and on to university. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the basis for the figures which show that the chances of obtaining a tertiary education are 18 times higher for a <span class="highlight">child</span> who has professional or senior executive parents than they are for a <span class="highlight">child</span> who has semi-skilled or unskilled parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The children of the unskilled have not the same opportunities for enlightenment as those whose parents have had the advantage of secondary education and tertiary education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If you do get married you should continue to work and have no children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not make the mistake of getting married first and having .children because housing costs are such that you will never be able to obtain a home.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Flat owners seem to object  to having as tenants couples who have children, so of necessity a family man who does not own a home must rent a house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no provision in this Budget by way of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to assist the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is of little use to the wife and 3 children of an unemployed man to know that the family would be getting more money to meet their needs if the husband was an invalid or a TPI pensioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Deductions for a wife and <span class="highlight">child</span>, superannuation, health costs and so on are worth far more, to those on a high income than to those on a low income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the intention of tax deductions is to assist the lower income man with dependants, he would be much better off if deductions were abolished and the extra revenue raised given back either as a form of negative taxation or as drastically increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I come back to this subject of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In effect, it has not recognised the existence of families; rather it has tended to place importance on large scale and expensive immigration programmes and deprive Australia of the best source of population - that is the children born in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the increased amounts of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment were taxed, this revenue could be redistributed back to where it is most needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The disadvantage  of  flat rate benefits such as <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment is that they are the same regardless of need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding of his proposition is that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment should be increased and be made a part of one’s taxable income so that the rich will pay income tax on it and the lower income group will not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place, the Government has failed horribly in relation to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the Government must hang its head in shame when it realises that it has failed parents by not providing better <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment than is paid today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A little later  Senator Murphy  referred to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, which was last increased in 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>implication in that is that, were we the Government, we would see that an alteration was made to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us consider the case of a family man who has a wife and 4 children and receives $60 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compare the plight of this person with the situation of a man who has a wife and only 1 <span class="highlight">child</span> and who earns $160 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is the first family man who requires more assistance, the family man with 4 or 5 children who is on a low income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These statistics prove the need for some improvement in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments on the lines advocated by the Democratic Labor Party because only increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment will assist these persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Commissioner of Taxation in assessing the returns submitted by these people should grant greater rebates for each of the children dependent upon them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been no <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment increase since 1967 - prior to the last Senate election - and the previous increase was in 1964, which also was a Senate election year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that basis I had hoped that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment would be increased this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This year being a Senate election year, I hope that we will again see an increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Gair  pointed out that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment has not been increased since 1967 and said that the previous increase was in 1964. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are such things as maternity and <span class="highlight">child</span> allowances and an increase in the pension at least to compensate for cost of living adjustments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>In addition, there will be an extra $2 per week if any one of the children is under 6 years of age or an invalid, plus, of course, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment at ordinary rates in all cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will cite the things that this boy needed and I think every honourable senator will agree that it is the barest minimum: 2 pairs of college grey trousers at $12.50 per pair; a Lloyd Mason blazer at $16.99; 3 school shirts at $5.10 - I do not know of any youngster who would need only 3 shirts in a year: a school hat costing $4.99; a plastic hat cover costing 50c: one pullover at $6.99 - in this climate one pullover would be insufficient; 3 pairs of golf socks at $1.15 per pair; one pair of white golf socks at $1.20; 2 pairs of school shoes at $6.99 - and they would be a pretty cheap type of shoe; 2 pairs of white sandshoes at $2.10: one raincoat at $1.80 - that is the ordinary cheap plastic raincoat which is bought at the chain stores; one sports shirt at $1.20; one pair of sports shorts at $1.75; one leather belt at $1.50; a school badge at 80c; one school tie at $1.20 - and the average <span class="highlight">child</span> needs at least 3 ties a year, not one; a hatband at 75c: one pair of swim trunks at $2.50; and one briefcase at $7.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Bourke also referred to endowment of the first <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know of cases, particularly of public servants, who have neither chick nor <span class="highlight">child</span> but only themselves and their wives and who finish up with the bare compulsory units of superannuation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compare the situation of those people with that of a man with 3 or 4 children whom he had educated and who, because he has contributed to a superannuation scheme at. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I recall it,  Senator Keeffe  relied upon basically the same figures in speaking of the costs faced by mothers in clothing children for school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is good enough for my children and no doubt for great numbers of school children in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That old system very substantially reduces the costs involved in clothing school children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures cited by  Senator Keeffe  are quite unreal because they are based on the supposition that every parent of school children buys new clothing for each <span class="highlight">child</span> and that no school <span class="highlight">child</span>  s  ever accepts hand-me-down clothing from a brother or cousin to be worn for as long as it fits and then passed on to somebody else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the basic wage to which  Senator Rae  referred was based on the needs of a family unit of a man and his wife and their 2 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This meant that those couples who had more than 2 children had to curtail some of their expenditure and live somewhat cheaper than a man who had only his wife and 2 children to support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the family unit with less than 2 children, including the single man, received a higher income and did somewhat better out of the basic wage which was determined from time to time according to cost of Irving figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chifley Government introduced the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment system in order to give some justice to those couples who had more than 2 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We could even come down the list quite a way and regard recreational activities, family and <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare as well as counselling services, as coming within the field of social services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I mentioned during the Budget debate, an independent body at the Melbourne University pointed out that the minimum rate which should have been paid to pensioners was $2 a week - not 50c a week - that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment should have been increased to $3.50 a week, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that the Chifley Government introduced <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to assist larger than average families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was the Menzies Government that introduced <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment in 1941. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that in 1950 we introduced legislation to extend endowment to the first <span class="highlight">child</span> and that legislation was delayed by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Third Schedule will be amended to provide increases of 60c per week for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> of an ex-serviceman, who dies from war causes, and 75c for the second and subsequent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a double orphan, that is a <span class="highlight">child</span> who has also lost the other parent, the increase will be $1.85 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the average youngster today, 1 suppose even those in the lower income group, 60c a week is about the amount of pocket money he receives, but here is this benevolent Government granting an increase of 60c a week to a <span class="highlight">child</span> who will never know its father. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments only made to the mother of a <span class="highlight">child</span>, or, where the <span class="highlight">child</span> is not in the custody of the mother, to an approved guardian or approved institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Social Services Act, endowment is payable to a person having the custody, care and control of a <span class="highlight">child</span> - in practice this is usually the mother - or to an institution of which the <span class="highlight">child</span> is an inmate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister representing the Minister for Social Services inform the Parliament who authorises the payment of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to a person other than the mother when the <span class="highlight">child</span> is temporarily in the care of another person but where an authority for the collection of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment has not been authorised by the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s mother or its legal guardian? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700930_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that the problem of <span class="highlight">child</span> poisonings should be of very real concern to us all and in bringing the Council statement to your notice I would urge you to give serious consideration to this problem and to the feasibility of implementing the Council recommendation concerning the use of safety closures for dispensed medicines.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700930_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth also makes an annual grant of $150,000 to the Lady Gowrie <span class="highlight">Child</span> Centres and an annual grant ($18,800 in 1970-71) to the Australian Pre-School Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Section 109 of the Life Insurance Act 1945-61 prevents an insurance company from paying even for the funeral expenses at the death of a <span class="highlight">child</span> under the age of 10 years although life insurance on the <span class="highlight">child</span> may have been paid for a period of up to 9 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701014_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is <span class="highlight">Child</span> Endowment paid continuously to approved institutions  in  respect of Aboriginal children who are inmates, and is the continuity of payment not broken, even when the children return to their parents during school vacation periods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701014_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister take appropriate steps to ensure that <span class="highlight">Child</span> Endowment payments are paid to the mothers during the period when such Aboriginal children are not actually residents ‘ of institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701014_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (2) Where a <span class="highlight">child</span>, whether or not an Aboriginal, leaves an approved institution for a school vacation on the understanding he will return at the end of the vacation, it is usual to continue to pay endowment to the institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701014_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a <span class="highlight">child</span> leaves an institution permanently, or if the parent/guardian and the institution are unable to agree as to terms in respect of the vacation period, the endowment is paid, on application, to the parent or guardian of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701014_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Why are schools, persons and hostels in Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia legally able to collect <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments, by a gentleman’s agreement with the Departmentof Social Services, but thisarrangement operates only where the mother is an Aboriginal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701020_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Social Services Act provides for the payment of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to a person having custody, care and control of a <span class="highlight">child</span> or to an approved institution (see section 95 of the Act). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701020_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Social Services Act provides for the grant of <span class="highlight">child</span> andowment to persons having the custody, care and control of children and to approved institutions of which children are inmates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701020_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any question about the entitlement of a claimant to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, e.g. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701020_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>involving the custody, care and control of a <span class="highlight">child</span>, would be resolved by a duly authorised officer of the Department of Social Services after examination of all the circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701020_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is a demand for increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and for immense sums to be spent upon education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our feeling was that since it was such a small amount there was a good case - we expressed that case - for leaving taxation as it was and for using the money to assist the farmers, for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, for education, and to give the pensioners a fair deal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the average good hearted Australian were asked: ‘Do you want the few dollars that you are to get out of this or would you sooner see more money given to the pensioners and the farmers, for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and education, and to other good causes?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would have been better to give the money to help families through <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and education, to increase pensions and to help farmers in necessity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator McManus,  on behalf of the Australian Democratic Labor Party, has stated that because of the demands of farmers, because of the demands for increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment - there has been no increase for at least 15 years - because of the demands for increased amounts to be awarded to pensioners, because of the demands for larger amounts to be spent on education and because of the requirements for decentralisation, it is difficult to see avenues in which taxation can be reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever the Government may have given the taxpayer by way of reduced income tax it has not worried very much about <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment instead of reducing income tax, more people would benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On at least 2 occasions, my Party has moved for the withdrawal of a budget in toto because it did not contain provision for an increase to pensioners and because it did not increase <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment or contain many other things we thought it should have contained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I deplored also the fact that there was no additional provision for the family man in the form of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As you know,  Mr Deputy President,  the Party which I am privileged to lead has been a strong advocate for generous payments under the heading of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment because we believe the family man is bearing a burden out of proportion to what he should be bearing today because of increased costs of living and because of the relatively poor position that he is in compared with his married fellow worker with no family or the single man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not contesting the justice of that principle, but a spinster could be working in a job side by side with a married man who has five or six children and they both receive the same income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No-one could tell me that there should not be a generous provision for that man for the maintenance of his wife and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only means that I can see of doing justice to him is under the heading of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Generally speaking payments made by a parent for the attendance of his <span class="highlight">child</span> at a pre-school or kindergarten would be deductible for income tax purposes under the heading of education expenses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is accepted that a <span class="highlight">child</span> who attends preschool or kindergarten for the maximum period each week appropriate to his or her age is receiving full-time education at a school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Payments to such establishments are considered to be for the care, supervision and maintenance of a <span class="highlight">child</span>, rather than for full-time education; any education that a <span class="highlight">child</span> may receive being no more than incidental and ancillary to the care and maintenance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>(8.26) -  Senator Poyser  raised the question of what would happen if a European family adopted a <span class="highlight">child</span> who would not normally come within the category- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In connection with that part of the answer given today the honourable senator asked what would be the position if they had adopted a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My reply to the honourable senator is: Sympathetic consideration would be given to the adopted <span class="highlight">child</span> being given an assisted passage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also included is the cost of equipping initially and establishing <span class="highlight">child</span> migrants arriving in Australia and proceeding to approved institutions for care and maintenance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only reply I could get from the Minister in response to my queries in relation to this matter was that the only concession that would be made is that sympathetic consideration would be given to a <span class="highlight">child</span> adopted by European people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer is obviously a flat ‘no’ in relation to a European who has married a non-European and then has children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>I presume the one or more in this case would be the wife and the 3 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a disgraceful situation when, because he chose somebody he desired to spend the rest of his life with and because he chose to have a family and bring young children into this community, the Government says ‘No’ because the colour of his wife’s skin is different, and because the colour of his children’s skin will be different, from the colour of his own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a most disgraceful thing and cannot be fobbed off as far as I am concerned by the Minister saying that if it was an adopted <span class="highlight">child</span>- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I inform the honourable senator that entry of the wife or children of a European migrant is not denied because they are not fully European, but an assisted passage is not normally granted to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Minister thinks that $8 plus <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment is enough to keep a family of five or six kiddies in proper health, I would ask her to draw up a diet chart showing what they are required to eat and how much they can purchase with this amount of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Tt will finance the purchase of approved capital equipment of the language laboratory type for use in the special classes which will be established, lt will provide suitable teaching and learning materials not only to schools where special classes are formed but also to schools where there are insufficient numbers of migrant children with language problems to justify the appointment of a special teacher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because what is planned in the adult programme and with intensive courses is essentially an extension of existing programmes, the Bill is concerned largely with the area of the major new initiative in <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education^ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>of clause 9 relates to certain types of payments, which it was thought desirable to refer to specifically, with respect to arrangements entered into with the government of a State - under- both’ the adult programme and the <span class="highlight">child</span> programme-as well as with an independent school -authority under the <span class="highlight">child</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be useful,  Mr President,  if 1 were to explain that schools which will qualify for financial assistance under the special programme for <span class="highlight">child</span> migrants will be those where a special teacher is employed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The appointment of a special teacher will in turn require, as a general “rule, a minimum of 30 migrant children in the school in need of special instruction in the English language - though the children may be taught in smaller groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>of clause 9 is intended to provide for the situation where the State Education Department or independent school authority may wish to purchase teaching and learning materials which are not suitable for production under the arrangement referred to in clause S but which may be considered necessary to the effective implementation of the <span class="highlight">child</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is important that migrant parents, who are adult people and therefore might not have learnt English in their native country should be able to communicate very freely with their children at their various age groups and various levels of experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This takes on a new importance when it is recognised that children, by virtue of their going to school or having an association with Australian-born children, have a distinct advantage in acquiring a knowledge of the English language rather more rapidly than their parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In relation to migrant children it was pointed out that many of them, in both government and independent schools, were handicapped by some difficulty with the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The greatest area of problem and the most frequently occurring type of difficulty involving 76 per cent of the migrant school children involved was in the comprehension of English and difficulty in reading and speaking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Taking the matter of communication a step further, the subjects most affected by a migrant <span class="highlight">child</span>’s difficulty with English were those in which some form of communication was involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As has been stated already in this House and by the Minister in another place, in February 1960 a special committee of the Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Council submitted a report on the progress and assimilation of migrant children in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This involved a study of both pre-school children and children in primary and secondary schools, a survey of schools in which migrant children .were enrolled and consultation with the teachers who were dealing with these children very closely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was the planning of a major survey of the education needs of both adult and <span class="highlight">child</span> migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This led to the report which has been referred to previously on the situation of migrant children in schools in New South Wales and which has provided such an important basis for the new initiatives in <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, the <span class="highlight">child</span> of a Turkish national covered by themedical benefits scheme who undergoes circumcision at 8 years of age would qualify for benefit under eitheritem 3755 or Item 3756 according to the circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710315_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What action does his Department intend to take to correct the shocking neglect of Aboriginal children as shown by the research of the Queensland Director of Maternal and <span class="highlight">Child</span> Services in that the Aboriginal infant mortality rate was up to 10 times the national average and the death rate of Aboriginal children aged between 12 months and 4 years was up to 17 times the overall Australian rate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To illustrate my argument on how discrimination can exist between States, I take the case of a lad who was born in Brisbane at 12.20 on the morning of 20th March” 1951 and compare it with the case of a <span class="highlight">child</span> who was born at that same instant in South Australia or Western Australia, lt would not be unreasonable that a male <span class="highlight">child</span> could have been born at the same time in those States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710420_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although they were born at the same instant, the <span class="highlight">child</span> born in South Australia or Western Australia would register his date of birth as 19th March 1951 whereas the <span class="highlight">child</span> born in Queensland would register 20th March 1951 as his date of birth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710420_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While wages have increased repeatedly at the instance of arbitration tribunals as a result of the representations of employee organisations and while there have been reductions in taxation - no doubt as a result of representations by the taxpayer associations and organisations which are looking after the interests of taxpayers, there has been no variation in the level of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments since 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> endowment payments have not been increased as fast as incomes have risen in Australia in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been a tragic deterioration in the relativity of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to gross national expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has shown that in 1949 <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment represented 2.6 per cent of the average national earnings, but by 1970 it had dropped to 0.7 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment has become virtually a worthless contribution towards the assistance, succour and welfare of families of this nature, but nothing has been done about the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My Party has over a number of years - by resolutions at its federal conferences, by the presentation in this place in 1966 of a Bill designed to increase the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment rates and by an annual amendment to the motion for the presentation of the Budget papers - constantly waged a campaign to have this matter receive the particular attention of the Government, but my Party has not been successful since 1967 in persuading the Government to’ increase <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that period there has been virtually a 100 per cent increase in the national financial appropriation for immigration but only about a 16 per cent increase in the appropriation for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other point I make with respect to  Senator Byrne’s  reference to the Henderson report concerns what Professor Henderson himself recommended with regard to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the book People in Poverty’ - actually it was his report - he wrote that the obvious remedy for poverty in large families is an increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He proposed rates in respect of children under 16 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were as follows: For the first <span class="highlight">child</span>,  Si  a week - at the moment it is 50c; for the second <span class="highlight">child</span>, $1.50 a week, whereas at the moment it is $1; for the third <span class="highlight">child</span> $3.50 a week, whereas at the present time it is  Si  -SO; for the fourth and subsequent children $4.50 per week for each <span class="highlight">child</span>, whereas for the fourth <span class="highlight">child</span> the present rate is $1.75, increasing to $3.25 a week for the tenth <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was also made on the assumption, as appears in that book, that all the concessional taxation deductions for children should be abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost of the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment provision which the Government made available in the last financial year was $220m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you add $185m to $220m you get more than $400m as the amount payable for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one takes <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment as an example, it was the first government headed by  Sir Robert  Menzies which introduced <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment as a Federal social service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the government headed by  Sir Robert  Menzies assumed office in 1949-50 it made the first change to the rates of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, notwithstanding that the Australian Labor Party said that it could not be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first change I mention was in June 1950 when endowment at the rate of 50c a week became payable for the first or only <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The payment of $1 a week continued for the second <span class="highlight">child</span> and subsequent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second change I mention occurred in 1964 when the rate for the third <span class="highlight">child</span> and subsequent children in a family was increased by 50c to $1.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time the rate of endowment for children who were in institutions was increased to $1.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1967 endowment rates were further increased by 25c a week for the fourth <span class="highlight">child</span> and subsequent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rate for the fourth <span class="highlight">child</span> was increased to $1.75 a week, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where there are 2 children in the family the amount received is a mere $1.50 a week, but when there are 8 children in the family the amount received is $14.25 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there are 9 in the family it is $17.25 a week, and if there are 10 children it is $20.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am endeavouring to point out is that the Government has been conscious of the need to give consideration to these <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment rates and it has done so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important point I make is that the situation in which <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment originally was introduced is not the situation prevailing today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1941 when <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment was introduced the situation was, as the Government said, that the family unit was the cornerstone of national life and the key to our national progress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That social objective was met partly by <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>vagaries of unemployment which existed when <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment was introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They can therefore better provide for their families than could parents raising children in the latter part of the 1930s and the early war years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many other factors have been introduced which change the whole pattern of our social fabric, contrasting the present position with that which prevailed when <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment was introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span>, endowment is only one of those concessions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  remind honourable senators that income tax deductions for children have been substantially increased since 1949-50 Of course, they bear no relationship to the position which prevailed in 1940. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Concessional deductions are allowable for all children under the age of 16 years and for students up to the age of 21 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also remind honourable senators of the concessional deductions allowable to a taxpayer in respect of his spouse, a daughter housekeeper, student children, invalid relatives, parents., subscriptions to hospital and medical benefit insurance funds, medical and dental expenses, funeral expenses and education expenses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each of those deductions represents government assistance in ways other than <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the approach of the Australian Democratic Labor Party would certainly have been fairer had it referred to the various ways in which assistance is rendered to families by the Government, instead of being based on the assumption that the Government has culpably neglected <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Byrne  said, the rates of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment have not changed since 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through the national health scheme families have a very real ability to insure so that they will be able to offset medical and hospital expenses, a safeguard that was not available when <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment was introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I make is that in considering <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment one must have regard to the factual position when <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment was introduced and must consider what other facilities, benefits - and services were then available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If by contrasting the position in 1971 with the factual position in the way of the provision of benefits, concessions and other services it is found that it is totally different now from that obtaining at the time <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment was introduced, the relevance and importance of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment in the social scheme which the Government is providing becomes less significant. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 do not suggest that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment is riot a real benefit, but I say that it does not loom as large in the social fabric in 1971 as it did in 1941. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the Government constantly considers <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must bear them in mind in the light of its other obligations, and in particular the other services it pro1vides to assist parents and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have stressed that the cost of increasing <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment in the way that Professor Henderson indicated would be  SI  85m annually. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment was increased by 50c a week in respect of each endowed <span class="highlight">child</span> according to his place in the family, based upon statistics of the people receiving <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment at 4th January last the cost annually would bc about  SI  01m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the concurrence of honourable senators I incorporate in Hansard a table which sets out the cost of increasing <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment by 50c a week for each <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The following table sets out the current cost of paying a 50c per week increase in respect of each endowed <span class="highlight">child</span> according to his place in the family based on statistics relating to 4 January 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will appreciate from the amount involved that it is not so easy to increase <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment by 50c a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The motion of urgency moved by  Senator Byrne  involves matters other than <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He limited his remarks to the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment issue and I have responded similarly, but 1 am sure that my colleague  Senator Buttfield,  when she speaks in due course, will look at other aspects of what the Government has been doing which are under attack. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sense that in the areas in which  Senator Byrne  has criticised the Government it has a record of achievement which cannot be brushed aside simply by saying that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment rates have not been increased, and taking that factor as a measure for critical purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He referred to the culpability of the Federal Government in allowing <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment rates, particularly those for 3 or more children, and maternity allowances, to deteriorate in real value to such an extent that a family obtains no great assistance from the receipt of such payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly my own Party right throughout its ranks has shown great concern since its formation to fight for concessions in all forms of social service including <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, it is very difficult for them, in view of the affluence in which they live, to understand the situation that confronts the ordinary family, particularly the family with more than 2 or 3 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He referred to motions on social service payments, superannuation schemes and now <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this question of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment I have had the opportunity to go through policy speeches and our ‘Platform, Constitution and Rules’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his policy speeches  Mr Gough  Whitlam has stated what we will do in the fields of social services, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, housing and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> endowment rales have not been changed since the Menzies Government came to power, although the first <span class="highlight">child</span> has been endowed since 1950. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor will immediately legislate for these rates - for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> 10s per week; for tha second 17s 6d; and for each additional <span class="highlight">child</span> 1 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor’s policy proposes that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment be adjusted in accordance with living costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New South Wales under J. T. Lang which introduced <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> endowment has been an issue of ours right from the early days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe in the importance of healthy, happy children, in a home ownership community and in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to go to the mother for the direct assistance of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 certainly hope that in time the Government will be able to increase <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it has assisted the happy family and the happy, healthy <span class="highlight">child</span> in many other ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is the reason for objecting to the fact that the Government has not increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment why does not the honourable senator suggest a means test so that it will go specifically to those in most urgent need? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why does he not suggest that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment bc made taxable in all cases because obviously those in the higher income bracket will not then receive anything. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has suggested that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment should be raised but he has stressed it is for the people who are in need and in the poverty bracket. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not going into detail because of lack of time but I shall repeat the things this Government has done to assist the family, either indirectly or directly, and also to assist children in addition to the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has introduced the pharmaceutical benefits which assists the family and the <span class="highlight">child</span> and introduced income tax concessions in respect of children at a total cost to revenue in the year 1967-68 - the latest figure I could obtain - of $266m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has made free milk available for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has made provision for handicapped children and the children of pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that it is unrealistic to pick on one aspect and say that the Government has been culpably neglectful of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second item in the matter of urgency was in respect of a New Zealand scheme for capitalisation of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then the <span class="highlight">child</span> suffers very much because there is no regular payment coming in as our system provides when a mother is receiving a payment directly for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a much better scheme in Australia where the mother knows that while her children are under 16 years of age she will receive a weekly payment for their direct assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the combination of the 2 schemes which we have in Australia - the home savings grant and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment - are much more equitable, generous and effective for children than if we adopted a scheme like the New Zealand one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On the matter of costs I should like to cite a few figures to show what would be the cost of implementing the first point contained in the proposal advanced by the Opposition, that is, to raise <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment If the endowment for each <span class="highlight">child</span> were raised by 50c per week it would cost about $101m <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that there are 1,700,000 first children in respect of whom parents are receiving <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, that there are 1,165,000 second children, 569,000 third children, 232,000 fourth children, 85,000 fifth children, 32,000 sixth children, 12,000 seventh children, 4,000 eighth children, 1,500 ninth children and 818 tenth or later children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To increase the endowment in respect of each of those children would cost $!01m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tt seems to me that we should be praising the Government for what it is doing, for having such a wide range of interests in respect of which improvements are made regularly for the benefit of the family and the children, instead of picking out one item and saying that in this respect the Government has been culpably neglectful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that T hope that the Government can increase <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, but T would not like to see it sacrifice other community interests and community services to achieve an improvement in one area only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that it was the Democratic Labor Party which supported the Government in all its action during the last Budget session when it increased indirect taxation and effected other changes which immediately reduced the value to the recipients of social service benefits and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now members of the Democratic Labor Party complain that the Government has not seen fit to increase <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment or to do other things which are outlined in the motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view this is sheer political humbug because they, aided and abetted by the Government, were the instruments by which <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments have deteriorated to the point they have now reached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we were to ask any mother what the position is with regard to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments today, without recourse to statistics she would reply that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment has eroded to such an extent that its effect is now almost negligible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Democratic Labor Party are the very ones who have prevented <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments from being increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On innumerable occasions the Australian Labor Party has put forward proposals to increase <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, but the DLP has supported the Liberal Party and the Country Party at election times and has thus denied to the Australian Labor Party an opportunity to give effect to what the DLP now says should be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that it is sheer political humbug to come into this place crying that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments have been eroded when those senators, combined with Government supporters, have been the instrument by which <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments have been eroded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A cold analysis of the situation reveals starkly that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments have deteriorated to a degree that is a disgrace to the Government of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it being suggested that the Government will never give consideration to the erosion in value of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments and has no intention of increasing <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment in the future? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The parents of Australian children should be made aware of the Government’s lack of interest in this direction and should realise that if, unhappily, the Government is returned at the next general election, whether it is in 1971 or 1972, it will be the fate of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments to remain at their present stagnated level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a very happy thought for the parents of children born in Australia to realise that they are expected to rear their children in the most difficult circumstances and that in future they will be given no relief or assistance by way of increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet it comes before this Parliament and says: ‘Look, we have done so much for the parents of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first was raised by the Minister for Health  (Senator Greenwood)  who is frightened at what an increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment might cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Health  (Senator Greenwood)  talked of taxation concessions to supplement <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The increases in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment have not kept pace with the general increases in the inflationary spiral which the Government admits have taken place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me remind him that the man most affected by the increases - the man on the basic wage, whose wife does not .work, and who has 3 or 4 children - does not pay any tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say this to him: These frightening amounts of millions, which he suggested, will not disappear if the Government pays increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet leave was denied to me in my humble efforts to do something for the family man under the heading of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He decides that the Opposition will not approve of the gag in order to get a vote on the proposal of the Democratic Labor Party in regard to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know from the motions moved by the Democratic Labor Party to enable debates on urgent matters earlier this year that the DLP is concerned about social service pensions and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we consider those 2 specific items we know that to give the Democratic Labor Party what it was seeking in terms of an increase of $1 a week in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment would cost Australia $185m in one year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major area of expenditure is in the field of pensions which are provided not only for aged persons but also for disabled persons and for the wives and children of such pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Other benefits are <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and funeral benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, I believe one would need to be a <span class="highlight">child</span> of nature to suggest that something of that kind is not occurring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have examined the information Report by  Mr B.  E. Reynolds on his observations of overseas methods of teaching the deaf and multiple handicapped deaf <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Reynolds  stated that he considered the Combined Method of instruction used by teachers at the Victoria School for Deaf Children is ‘equal to, if not superior to, any combined method being used in any one of the countries visited’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payable in Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A -Bill was -introduced by- the Menzies Government in, I think, 1940 when Judge Beeby said that unless <span class="highlight">child</span>’ endowment was given to all children but the first <span class="highlight">child</span> there would have to be a very significant increase in the basic wage of the day.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Menzies Administration thought out this tax in order that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment could be paid for each <span class="highlight">child</span> other than the first. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also stated that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment money in a bank account had been seized by the trustee  and added to the estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issue of the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment referred to by  Senator O’Byrne  involved a question as to whether a bank account was part of the property of the debtor’s estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal and State governments of this country saw the justice of spending at least portion of the funds allotted from the public purse for education on children attending private schools only when they were driven to it by sheer necessity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seemed that the State system would collapse completely because the children educated privately would also need to be catered for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These children had been taken off the back of the taxpayers in respect of education expenditure because their parents were paying for their education in addition to their contributions to the public purse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of us who are interested in children and in their education well know that the educational opportunities of the second, third and fourth <span class="highlight">child</span> in a family were being neglected because of the sheer lack of finance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A family could not provide the money to continue educating the third, fourth and perhaps the fifth <span class="highlight">child</span> who might have, been particularly brilliant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would not be a private school, whether it has a religious background or not, in this community that would not be thoroughly satisfied to receive from the public purse per pupil the amount that it costs to educate each <span class="highlight">child</span> in a state school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are talking of spending more money on education, it is high time we had an investigation to inform us ali why it costs so much more to educate each <span class="highlight">child</span> in a state school than in the private schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps it is the efficiency of the private schools, because the standard to which a <span class="highlight">child</span> has to be educated still is set by the State and it ultimately has to be met by the schools, private or state, irrespective of their circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But no grants at all had been made available for science laboratories or anything else in private schools until quite recently, and even now the -grants are a fraction only of what it costs to educate a <span class="highlight">child</span> to the standard set for state schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least that would bring a substantial measure of justice to that section of the community, that section of  my Australian brothers and neighbours who have paid their taxes for a lifetime for the education of their children and have then paid out of their own pockets as well for that education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So did the parents of the <span class="highlight">child</span> next door, but they did not get the same advantage because they also paid for their <span class="highlight">child</span>’s education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In South Australia the amount in respect of a <span class="highlight">child</span> is $5  a  week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet- the Commonwealth compensation payment for a man, wife and <span class="highlight">child</span> is only $43.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation then is that under the Commonwealth Act the family unit - a man, wife and <span class="highlight">child</span> - receives only 50c more than the rate prescribed in South Australia for a single man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We consider rates of $35 a week for an unmarried man, $43.50 for a married man and $48.50 for a married man with one <span class="highlight">child</span> are quite inappropriate in this day and age when the average weekly wage is about $84 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 5 defines a <span class="highlight">child</span> to whom this Act applies as a person under the age of 16 years or a person who has attained the age of 16 years but is under the age of 21 years and is receiving full time education at a school, college or university. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a <span class="highlight">child</span> continues at university after he has attained the age of 21 years and is receiving a full time education, under the provisions of this Bill he is not a dependant <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the education of the <span class="highlight">child</span> remains the responsibility of the parent the <span class="highlight">child</span> should be classed as a dependant of the worker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consideration should also be given to inclusion of an invalid <span class="highlight">child</span> as a dependant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spastic children and paraplegics rely on whatever they get as a pension plus supplementary assistance from the parent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the interdepartmental committee which is to study this matter should consider the question of the <span class="highlight">child</span> over 21 years of age and the <span class="highlight">child</span> who, for some reason or other, is dependent for some assistance from the parent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I instance spastic children, those with mental illnesses, paraplegics, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She may have a <span class="highlight">child</span> to the deceased and the <span class="highlight">child</span> gets an allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time of the death of the deceased she may be pregnant to him and as I understand it the <span class="highlight">child</span> gets an allowance from birth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the mother of the <span class="highlight">child</span>, although she and the deceased had a de facto relationship and although they met all the requirements other than that of time, gets no allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could understand it if the definition referred to a person who formed the relationship in the belief that the individual was dying but I cannot understand it when it refers to a bona fide domestic relationship, particularly when the de facto wife finds that she will be supporting the <span class="highlight">child</span> of the deceased person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place, the definition of a <span class="highlight">child</span> is strictly a <span class="highlight">child</span> in relation to whom this Act applies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there are references to a <span class="highlight">child</span> in relation to whom this Act applies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that if any problem arises from time to time about children who remain at university after 21 years of age and who ought to be regarded as falling within this definition, that is a matter which will be reviewed by the interdepartmental committee because it is one of the points which has been raised by  Senator Cavanagh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be recognised that an invalid <span class="highlight">child</span> will receive some support by way of pension and will come also within the meaning of ‘dependant’ under the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if there is a reference at any time to a dependent <span class="highlight">child</span>, it relates to a <span class="highlight">child</span> who is dependent for economic support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second proposition that we brought forward was one relating to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-95-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that families of four or more children are penalised by a reduction in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payment when the eldest <span class="highlight">child</span> becomes eligible for student endowment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it also true that in a family of 8 children endowment is reduced from $57 a week to $46 a. week when the eldest <span class="highlight">child</span> becomes eligible for the $1.25 a week student allowance, thereby losing $65 a year endowment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All 1 can say is that in the presentation of the Budget last week significant advances were made, consistent with the economy’s capacity to bear them, in social service pensions and in endowment paid for the second <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> endowment is raised by 50c per week for the third and successive children; yet the 21/2 per cent increase in income tax more than takes away that benefit for the average income earner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has denied increases in social services, in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and other fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We of the Australian Democratic Labor Party believe that we have cause for some satisfaction inasmuch as matters which we believed merited urgency debates in this Senate, such as pensions, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and a readjustment of superannuation to exCommonwealth employees, have received the attention of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I heard  Senator Murphy  say that as far as the family man was concerned  2i  per cent would be more than he would gain from additional <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would be a decision based on a quick assessment, because the average family man - the man I have in mind would have 4, 5 or 6 children - on an average rate of pay does not pay tax at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the time he receives a rebate for his wife and children and for various expenses he would not pay tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my speech on last year’s Budget 1 pointed out that it was the family man on a low income with 4 or 5 children or more who was particularly in need of the Government’s concern and assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the Democratic Labor Party is particularly satisfied to note that the increases in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment in this Budget are to apply to the third and subsequent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Democratic Labor Party would like to see the capitalisation of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, the updating of the homes savings grants, as well as provision for marriage loans rebatable on the birth of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another is  Mr King,  who no doubt could qualify for student <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the purpose of fixing a poverty line, the people conducting the survey decided to take as the base the weekly income of a man with a wife and 2 children, which was below the basic wage plus <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, as at 30th June 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-55-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to weary honourable senators with a lot of detailed statistics but those who conducted the survey proposed to increase the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment rate for the third and subsequent children by $2. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-55-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this policy was adopted and the tax concession for children was abolished the amount needed to eliminate poverty in Australia in our time wouldbe reduced from$1 89m to $100m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-55-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Psychiatrists can trace every one of these cases back to a disturbed early childhood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-55-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Invariably a disturbed early childhood can be detected at school when a <span class="highlight">child</span> is 6 or 7 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-55-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Backward children can be detected because they will not co-operate with the class or with society, or they are in revolt against society, or they have an inability to mix. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-55-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Leader of the Government in the Senate remember that during the 1970 Senate election campaign, 10 months ago, the then Prime Minister promised to establish <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres for working mothers and suggested that between 500 and 750 centres were contemplated? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government consider that <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres are still necessary or has it repudiated the election promise? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government re-examine the critical problem of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres with a view to subsidising fully their construction? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This has been a big help to Aboriginal children in many parts of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have heard a lot about <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and how good the proposed increases will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At long last the Government has recognised that there is such a thing as <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as it has been revealed that the pension increase was not a full pension increase but a very partial one - that fact was concealed by the Government for quite a long time until finally the cat was let out of the bag - the proposed increases in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment are not quite as good as they sounded on Budget night because only 31.9 per cent of families will receive increased benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, less than onethird of the families with children will receive increased benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>And what about the election promise of <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government refuses
          to levy a capital gain tax - a tax which would enable pensions and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment rates
          . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This figure includes increased welfare services in
          the form of pensions, maternity allowances, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, unemployment and sickness
          benefits, rehabilitation services, sheltered employment allowances, funeral benefits,
          deserted wives benefits, personal care subsidy, national health services, nursing home
          benefits, handicapped children’s benefits, payments to public hospitals for
          pensioners, homes savings grants and matters such as these. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Instruction within the school needs
            to be individualised and ungraded (so that the <span class="highlight">child</span> will go at his own pace in each

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We talk about increases in social service pensions, education payments and
          <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, but if we take note of the sort of thing that  Dr Ehrlich  was talking about a week or so ago it seems
          that somewhere someone must say: This far and no farther’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer now to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He referred to the case of a family with 8 wholly supported children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the
          new <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment rates, when the eldest school <span class="highlight">child</span> turns 16 the endowment cheque of
          that family drops by $7. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, with a family of 2 wholly supported children the
          endowment cheque rises by $2 when the eldest school <span class="highlight">child</span> turns 16. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On page 7 of the Budget Speech he referred to the increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note that the payment for children under 16 years in institutions and for each <span class="highlight">child</span> under the age of 16 years where there are more than  2  children in a family will be increased by 50c a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We look at the payment of such things as pensions and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We note that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments to those with youngsters who are facing a continual struggle that the payment for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> has not been increased since 1950 - 21 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The wife of an age pensioner who is totally and permanently incapacitated, or who has one <span class="highlight">child</span>, receives $8 per week as a wife’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only reason a wife receives such an allowance is because her husband is incapacitated, is an invalid or they have one <span class="highlight">child</span>- If that wife goes out to work, she is debarred immediately from receiving the wife’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish now to deal with <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that families of 4 or more children are penalised by a reduction in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payment when the eldest <span class="highlight">child</span> becomes eligible for student endowment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it also true that in a family of 8 children endowment is reduced from $57 a week to $46 a week when the eldest <span class="highlight">child</span> becomes eligible for the $1.25 a week student allowance, thereby losing $65 a’ year endowment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I can say is that in the presentation of the Budget last week significant advances were made, consistent with the economy’s capacity to bear them, in social service pensions and in endowment paid for the second <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I asked the question I had full knowledge of the fact that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment had been increased in the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I was seeking to find out whether large families were being penalised when the eldest <span class="highlight">child</span> became eligible for student endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They produced documents and payment cards to show that their <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment had been reduced from $57 to $46 a week because the eldest <span class="highlight">child</span> at 16 years of age had become eligible for student endowment, which is paid every 3 months instead of every month as is the case with <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After a lapse of 3 months they would receive full payment for the student <span class="highlight">child</span> at the rate of $1.25 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is correct, I feel that the Government should quickly ensure that the people affected have restored to them their entitlement to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in  its  approach to age, invalid, widows and Service pensions <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, payments to those who are institutionalised, repatriation and the other aspects of social welfare in general the Government is working to a satisfactory plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another aspect of the Budget is <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed increase of 50c a week will provide some relief for families with more than 2 children but 1 believe that an anomaly that does exist in the Social Services Act, and which has been referred to today by  Senator Drury,  has been exposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that he is quite correct when he says that the amount of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment received by a family with more than 2 children decreases when the eldest of those children reaches the age of 16 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Australia, 1,750,000 families receive <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of those families, 12,700 have more than 6 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The anomaly which exists is that the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments received by a family with more than 2 children are reduced when the eldest <span class="highlight">child</span> attains 16 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed increase of 50c in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for the third and subsequent children, I believe, creates a worse anomaly as far as the income received from <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment by a family with more than 2 children is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the proposed increase of 50c, the first born <span class="highlight">child</span> in a family will attract a payment of 50c a week, the second <span class="highlight">child</span> will be paid $1 a week and the third <span class="highlight">child</span> will now receive $2 a week in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a total of $3.50 a week which is paid until the first <span class="highlight">child</span> reaches 16 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the first <span class="highlight">child</span> attains 16 years of age the parents of those 3 children are in this situation: The first <span class="highlight">child</span> does not receive 50c a week but is paid $1.50 a week as a student’s allowance if he continues bis education at school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third <span class="highlight">child</span> in the family becomes the second <span class="highlight">child</span> for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The payment in respect of that <span class="highlight">child</span> is reduced from $2 a week to $1 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second <span class="highlight">child</span> becomes the first <span class="highlight">child</span> for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment purposes and the payment in respect of that <span class="highlight">child</span> is reduced from $1 a week to 50c a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, that family with only 3 children loses a total of $1 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The parents of a family of 13 children wrote to me and drew this matter to my attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The more children in a family, the greater the anomaly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government decided that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments should continue until the <span class="highlight">child</span> reached the age of 21, not a great deal more expenditure would be involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I mentioned earlier, only 12,700 families in Australia have 6 or more children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments were to continue after a <span class="highlight">child</span> reached 16 years of age, and that <span class="highlight">child</span> did not receive the student’s allowance, the cost to the Government would not be very much especially when we recognise that an amount of $2,950m has been allocated for social welfare purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>50c in the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payable to each <span class="highlight">child</span> after the first 2 children would not cost the Government a substantial amount of additional funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Three of the children in this family of 13 of which I have spoken are students receiving the student’s allowance of $1.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that the total loss to this family when the eldest <span class="highlight">child</span> for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment purposes reaches 16 years of age is $8.25 a week because that <span class="highlight">child</span> loses his <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment entitlement and receives a student’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely these people could be given continuing assistance while they try to educate their children and to provide for them the same opportunities as other children are entitled to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Budget we find a contrast between what the Government provides to wealthy parents who can afford to send their children to private schools, and to other parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to this Budget, parents were allowed for each dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> an education deduction of  $300  a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only children of whom ( am aware who attend private schools and in respect of whom fees ranging between  S300  and  $400  a year are paid, are the children of wealthy  paren’s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Budget recently provided that the amount of tax deduction claimable for the education expenses of each dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> would rise from $300 a year to $400. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, if  a  man earning  a  taxable income of $3,000 per annum pays $100 per <span class="highlight">child</span> per annum on education, the tax rebate is $23 as against  a  possible maximum of $280 for ‘  a  taxpayer who could afford to spend $400. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When a <span class="highlight">child</span> is brought up under great mental strain with no knowledge of the background of his parentage, due in part to the attitude that we in our Christian society adopt, the basis of descent into crime is established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The rate of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for tho third and each subsequent <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 years in a family is to be increased by 50c per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment will cost about $26.5m per year, and will benefit about 1,020,000 children in about 610,000 families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I now come to the provisions of the Bill which are specifically oriented towards the family and the welfare of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First let me deal with the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment provisions in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment is payable at the rate of 50c per week for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 years in a family, $1 per week for the second <span class="highlight">child</span>, and $1.50 for the third <span class="highlight">child</span>, with cumulative increases of 25c per week for each subsequent <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Endowment in respect of children in institutions is paid at a flat rate of $1.50 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> endowment is now an accepted feature of family income and for some time the Government has been concerned that the larger family has been more adversely affected by wage and price increases than the smaller family with, say, one or two children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government believes that at the present time an effective way of providing real benefits to the larger family is by way of increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, the proposal in the Bill before the Senate is to increase endowment for the third and each subsequent <span class="highlight">child</span> in a family by 50c per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will mean that the rate- of endowment in respect of the third <span class="highlight">child</span> in a family will become 2 per week, in respect of the fourth <span class="highlight">child</span> $2.25 per week and so on, increasing by 25c for each additional <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment increases in the Bill will, as 1 have said, benefit over 1,000,000 children, spread in more than 600,000 families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be remembered also that there are many other benefits and concessions provided by the Commonwealth that tend to offset the cost to parents of maintaining children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost to revenue of providing income tax concessional deductions for children, including deductions in respect of education, exceeds some $250m per year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assistance is given to families through the National Health Act where the family insurance rates for a family with children - however many children - are pegged at the rate applicable to a married couple without children; special assistance is also provided for handicapped children and children of pensioners - the latter being a matter which I shall deal with more fully in a moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these exemplify the attitude of a responsible government, which is to provide benefits in respect of children in a way which will render positive assistance to the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now let me come to a most significant part of the Bill - a massive increase in the additional payments for children of all pensioners - age, invalid and widow - and of recipients of unemployment and sickness benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has examined their representations very carefully, and now proposes to increase the payment for the first <span class="highlight">child</span>, which at present is $2.50 per week by $2 per week, making it $4.50 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The payment for children other than the first, which is at present $3.50 per week, will be increased to the same uniform level of $4.50 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance was introduced in 1943, and at the time the Chifley Government went out of office in 1949 it was payable only in respect of the first <span class="highlight">child</span> of invalid pensioners, and age pensioners who were invalids, and then only at the rate of 90c per week - equal to about $2.25 per week at today’s prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Widows received no <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance at all, except for the 50c per week difference between the class A widow’s pension and the age and invalid pension rates then current. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 90c per week payable for the first or only <span class="highlight">child</span> of invalid and permanently incapacitated age pensioners was increased to $1.15 in 1951. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1956, additional pension at the rate of $1 per week was introduced for the second and each subsequent <span class="highlight">child</span> of invalid and permanently incapacitated age pensioners, and for the second and each subsequent <span class="highlight">child</span> of widows. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1961 the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance payable for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> of invalid pensioners and age pensioners who were invalids was increased to $1.50 per week, as also was the payment for the second and subsequent children of widows. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1963 payments for the second and subsequent children of invalid pensioners and age pensioners who were invalids, were increased to $1.50 per week and a payment of $1.50 per week was introduced for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> of widows. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Widows with dependent children received a mother’s allowance of $4 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1965 the children of all age pensioners were included, and a guardian’s allowance of $4 per week was introduced for single pensioners who had the custody of a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1968, the rate of payment for all children was increased to $2.50 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, the reference to the payment for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> of age and invalid pensioners as ‘<span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance’ was dropped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1969 the rate for the second and subsequent children was increased to $3.50 per week, and mothers’ and guardians’ allowances were increased to $6 per week where there was a <span class="highlight">child</span> under 6 or an invalid <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, in this present Budget, it is proposed to increase the payment for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> from $2.50 per week to $4.50 per week, and the payment for the second and subsequent children from $3.50 per week to the same level of $4.50 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have set out this history in some detail, because it shows the development of provisions under which entirely new treatment of children in bereaved or deprived circumstances has been given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the position under the Chifley Government, where a widow received nothing extra for her children beyond her 50c per week, and invalid pensioners got only 90c per week allowance, however many children they had, we have now progressed to the point where all children of pensioners - age, invalid and widow - attract $4.50 per week each; where all widows- with dependent children are entitled to a mother’s allowance of $4 per week; where some widows are also entitled to an extra mother’s allowance of $2 per week, and where some invalid and age pensioners are entitled to a guardian’s allowance of $4 per week or $6 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these <span class="highlight">child</span>-oriented allowances are, of course, additional to the very substantial increases in the real value of the base pensions which have been made since the time of the Chifley regime, and additional to the fringe benefits which have been introduced since that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the concurrence of honourable senators I incorporate in Hansard a table showing the position of a widow with dependent children, under the provisions of this Bill: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, as I have said, our social services programme for this year is <span class="highlight">child</span>-oriented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increases are also proposed in rates payable to war widows, to their children, and to those children who have lost both parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the first <span class="highlight">child</span> of an ex-serviceman whose death was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>related to war service, an increase of $1 a week will be payable, while the rate payable in respect of second and subsequent children will be increased by $2 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new rates for all these children will be $7 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>For a <span class="highlight">child</span> who has lost both parents, the increase will be $2 and the new rate will be $14 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 3 also increases the pension rates in respect of the children of deceased seamen coming under the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The weekly rate for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> rises by$1 to$7, and the rate for each other <span class="highlight">child</span> rises by $2 to $7, thus bringing the weekly rate of pension for each <span class="highlight">child</span> of a deceased seaman to a uniform amount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where the mother is dead also, the rate rises by $2 to $14 for each <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are told in the Budget Speech that the Government will introduce legislation to increase <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment by 50c a week for each <span class="highlight">child</span> under the age of 16 years in excess of  2  in a family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are families with 1 or  2  children not required to meet the high costs of living that are with us today? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should they be penalised by having their <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment restricted while others are receiving an increase? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think the Government could have been serious when, having said that the first <span class="highlight">child</span> should receive endowment, it says at this late stage that only families with more than  2  children shall receive an increased rate of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I repeat that it was a Liberal government which decided that the first <span class="highlight">child</span> should receive <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that in the case of the average income earner the 21 per cent increase in income tax more than takes away - note those words - the benefit of the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment increase of 50c a week for the third and successive children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I found that if the average income earner with 3 children is on an income of $80 a week he would have a taxable income of $60 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increase in his tax would be $7.84 and the increase is <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment would be $26. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>$80, the increase in tax would be $5.43 but the benefit gained by the increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment would be $52. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Murphy  said that the average income earner would more than lose the benefit of the increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, but the cases I have just cited indicate that in fact there would be a rather substantial gain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are trying to cushion the blow against the industry which, without a doubt, has contributed enormously to the well being of every man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should give consideration to our additional requirements for education, housing and social services, including pensions and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Based on the formula to which I have referred, endowment for 3 children under 16 years of age, with the proposed increase, will rise from 3.5 per cent of the average weekly earnings to 4.1 per cent until the end of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Turning to the class A widow’s pension, we see that for a widow with one dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> over 6 years, again there is an increase in the pension as a percentage of average weekly earnings from 26.6 per cent to 30.4 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Each of us, 1 am sure, could refer to many such cases - the person who is disabled; the <span class="highlight">child</span> who is left without any parents; the widow to whom I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 would like to present for the consideration of honourable senators some statistics regarding <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The adult rate for long term sickness benefit is to be increased as is the rate of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the time of the last Senate election, the former Prime Minister the Right Honourable John Gorton made a speech to the Australian people in which he stated that <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres would be established throughout the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 venture to say that we are unlikely to see the <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres established in the lifetime of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The final matter in this field is that some mothers in remote areas do not realise that they have to apply for the payment of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment or for the payment of the maternity allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fourthly, the family allowance provision, including the increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments to the third and subsequent children, represents rejection through the national Parliament of the new doctrine summarised in the slogan ‘Pollution is People’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it fair that these aged and sick people should have their income having children born under decent conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We of the Democratic Labor Party have been particularly interested in the provision for increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> endowment was last increased in  1966  or  1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We claim to have been responsible for a great and important departure in the matter of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were able to influence the then Treasurer, who is now Prime Minister, as to the necessity to alter the rate; instead of having a flat rate, to alter it to provide an increased amount for the third and subsequent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were successful and we have also been successful in obtaining recognition at last of the necessity to increase <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment in this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That increase will be of benefit to those people who recognise the necessity for and the importance and wholesomeness of having a population of our own and of having children born under decent conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already made a few remarks regarding <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have expressed the view on a number of occasions that the DLP is particularly satisfied with the form of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment increases in this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A married man with a wife and children to maintain receives the same income as a single man or a spinster woman who have neither chick nor <span class="highlight">child</span> to keep and who have obligations to nobody. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment scheme is the only way in which we can maintain any measure of justice to the fellow who is married and who is sincerely trying to do something for his family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is educating his children and helping them to go into a profession or calling so that they might serve their community in their own time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is expected, unless he receives a generous <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, to maintain those children and maintain his home on the same wage as a single man or a spinster woman who have neither chick nor <span class="highlight">child</span> to keep. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us get back to teaching children to respect those who are older than themselves and superior to themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Respect has been replaced not by requests but by demands; demands for this and demands for that; demands for power and demands for rights to which children are not entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our proposition with regard to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment is sound. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It applies to children in excess of 2 in a family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that those who are prepared to have this number of children merit the little which the Government does under the heading of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like now to refer to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, a subject which I mentioned in the couurse of my speech on the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know why <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment was introduced in the first instance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In  1941  the full bench of the Arbitration Court said that it could not differentiate between the single worker and the married worker with dependants and recommended that the legislature should introduce some form of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to supplement the income of the married man with a family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we all know, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment was introduced in  1941. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The normal means in Australia are provided to the worker through the minimum basic wage, which is supplemented by <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Originally the basic wage was viewed as a social wage which was sufficient to meet the heeds of a man, his wife and  3  children, but following the basic wage inquiry in  1934  the Commonwealth Arbitration Court veered away from this earlier concept of the basic wage as a social wage and decided that it should become an economic wage which would be the highest wage that the court deemed that industry was able to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In  1941  the Chief Judge of the Court considered that on the basis of needs only the basic wage then operative was sufficient to provide only frugal comfort for a family unit of  3.  that it offered only a meagre existence for a family unit of  4,  and that if there were more than  2  children a family on the basic wage would experience hardship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned in my speech on the Budget that in the case of a person who had more than  4  children, when the first <span class="highlight">child</span> reached the age of  16  years and became eligible for endowment under the student endowment scheme the family would lose a certain amount of the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the table which is part of the Minister’s speech on this Bill one finds that a family of  8  would have received  $14.25  a week before the eldest <span class="highlight">child</span> became eligible for student endowment, but that after the <span class="highlight">child</span> became eligible for the student endowment the family would receive only  $13  a week  - $1.25  a week or about  $65  a year less than had been received previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister set out in his second reading speech figures showing the rates of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the new scheme a family with 8 children under the age of 16 years will receive 17.25 a week, but if the first <span class="highlight">child</span> becomes eligible for the student’s allowance the amount received will be reduced to $16.25 or, in other words, Si less than the family would have received had the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment remained and the student’s allowance not been paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many families depend on <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to help tide them over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment was introduced to supplement the income of the breadwinner with a family so that the family could improve to some extent its standard of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How on earth can people who depend on <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment expect to maintain a decent standard of living if the payment is reduced? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the June-July issue of the Institute of Public Affairs magazine it is stated that 1,750,000 families in Australia are receiving <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of that number, 8,000 families have 7 children; 3,000 families have 8 children; 1,100 families have 9 children; 400 families have 10 children and 200 families have 11 children or more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures I have cited relate to families with more than 6 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some action should be taken to restore to those families the money they would have received under the old scheme of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under the heading ‘<span class="highlight">Child</span> endowment anomaly’  Mr Stone  has this to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> endowment is a very small social security payment designed to partially offset the financial penalties of having children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principle appears to be the more the children, the more the assistance given per <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Department of Social Services has assured me of the accuracy of the following situation: Under the new rates payable per month of 28 days (a) for a family with 8 wholly supported children, when the eldest school <span class="highlight">child</span> turns 16 the endowment cheque drops by $7. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the family of 2 wholly supported children, when the eldest school <span class="highlight">child</span> turns 16 the endowment cheque rises by $2. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like the Minister to use his endeavours to have the scheme in relation to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment altered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill contains 2 provisions involving increases in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is a provision under which the third <span class="highlight">child</span> and all subsequent children will receive an increase of 50c in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the other provision there will be an increase of 50c a week in the endowment payable in respect of children who live in approved institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Possibly as significant in itself as any of the other matters provided for by this measure is the provision for additional payment for the children of age, invalid and widow pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A set figure of $4.50 a week will now be paid in respect of the children of all age, invalid and widow pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For widows there is a mother’s allowance, which is not introduced by this measure but which is part of the provision that has been made in recent years, of $4 or $6 a week according to the age of the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Drury raised an aspect about fringe benefits and also certain problems in relation to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the aspect of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment I would simply say to  Senator Drury  that it is a fact that when a <span class="highlight">child</span> turns 16 and receives student endowment the amount received by the family in which there are more than 2 children will undoubtedly decrease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that the anomaly exists - if there should be an anomaly, and I do not concede that there is - because the Government has increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment - but because the payment of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment ceases when the <span class="highlight">child</span> reaches the age of 16. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 21st April this year,  Senator Byrne  moved an urgency motion in relation to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, maternity allowance and the home savings grant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One might also couple with that fact the provision which the Bill makes for an increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and for an increase to $4.50 a week in the payment made for children of aged, invalid and widowed pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-93-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask honourable senators: Do you know the last occasion on which the Government was grateful enough to increase the amount paid for the dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> of an ex-serviceman, whether in receipt of a TPI pension or a general rate pension? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That was the last occasion on which there was an increase in the rate of pension paid in respect of a dependent <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is so grateful that it has never given consideration to increasing the amount paid in respect of dependent children of ex-servicemen who are on the special rate or TPI rate of pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The situation is comparable to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment paid for the first <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 claim for my Party credit for having influenced the Government to alter the flat rate system of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments and for granting an increased rate of payment in respect of all children in each family after the second <span class="highlight">child</span> in order to assist big families to get by. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With equal pay for the sexes  -  I am not growling about that at all - an unmarried woman without chick or <span class="highlight">child</span> to maintain will receive the same income as a male, if she is doing the same work as that male; yet that male may be married and have a family to support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that it is a very bad thing for a country like ours to overlook the necessity for making adequate provision for the children of any family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thinking about this subject, I do believe that some crimes of violence - the most coldly calculated and thought out crimes such as the hijacking of aircraft or the holding to ramsom of a <span class="highlight">child</span> to extract money from its parents - are such that the deterrent of a death penalty in itself would operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the provisions of the Social Services Act recently passed by Parliament a uniform payment of $4.50 a week is made for each <span class="highlight">child</span>, under 16 years, in the care of an age, invalid or widow pensioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the purpose of this provision, a <span class="highlight">child</span> between the ages of 16 and 21 years is deemed to be a <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 years of age if he is receiving full-time education at a school, college or university. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the provisions of the Social Services Act, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment since its introduction in 1941, has ceased on a <span class="highlight">child</span> attaining 16 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where a <span class="highlight">child</span> over the age of 16 years is receiving full-time education at a school, college or university, student endowment is payable at the flat rate of $1.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, when  a  <span class="highlight">child</span> in  a  family  of  3 (or more) children  reaches 16 years and attracts student endowment, the total payment for the family will be reduced but even so it remains $1.50 a week higher than it would have been had the Government not introduced student endowment in 1964. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was introduced by the Menzies Government in 1941 because the Commonwealth wished to accept the responsibility of paying <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, although the population has increased and although the rates of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment have varied slightly, required only two-thirds of that amount - namely $200m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that payroll tax was introduced in 1941 as a measure to assist the payment of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment is recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Largely, the legislation 10 introduce the tax was supported as being very just, because, in a period of war and of some financial difficulties, it sought to provide the Commonwealth with sufficient funds to enable it to take over the responsibilities of making a 5s <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payment to all children under 16 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the tax was introduced it accounted for nine-thirteenths of the amount that was paid by the Commonwealth in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are now on the other side of the penny, because in the period presently under review, during which the Commonwealth proposes to vacate the field of payroll tax, Consolidated Revenue profited from payroll tax by 832m in excess of the amount needed to meet <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment commitments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators on both sides of the chamber have agreed, payroll tax was introduced to offset the cost of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment but despite the fact that in the last financial year $3 2m was paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund in payroll tax, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment has been kept to a very low level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Hospital has been in touch with the Minister and his predecessor since October of last year, particularly about cases of malnutrition amongst newly arrived Turkish migrant children, and other cases where there was said to be inadequate <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711012_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One would have to be a <span class="highlight">child</span> of nature if one believed that there were not conflicts in that statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The attempt to extort money from parents by using their <span class="highlight">child</span> as a hostage, who is destroyed, in my opinion gives society the moral right to extort the extreme penalty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand the Labor movement believes that if a person is sick - be that person an adult or a <span class="highlight">child</span> - it is the responsibility of the Government to ensure that that person has the best treatment available to him or her at all times, irrespective of income and irrespective of position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the area of curative services, and specifically those applying to Aboriginal infants, I am pleased to be able to report to the Senate that yesterday the final steps were taken to complete the acquisition of a large motel in Alice Springs which is to be converted as a matter of urgency for use as a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711102_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Government announced new initiatives for migrant education in April 1970, involving for adults a transfer in emphasis to more specialised and accelerated forms of instruction and substantial development In the area of <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education, the Government directed also that there should be a review of the long-term continuation programme (in addition to a high abandonment rate which had become evident there was a need also to assess the justification for continuing to meet expenditure with respect to single classes catering in many Instances only for small numbers of migrants). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suggest that there would not be anybody in this chamber who would not’ say that a genuinely unemployed person who wants to work - noi a person who is permanently unemployable or deliberately unemployable because he is attending demonstrations half the time and is on employment relief - needs to receive about the minimum wage in order to keep his wife, his <span class="highlight">child</span> and himself decently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that the minimum wage has increased by $19 a week and the unemployment benefits for a man, his wife and one <span class="highlight">child</span> have increased by only $7.25 a week, we members of the Democratic Labor Party suggest that, if there i to be any increase at all - or even if there is not to be any increase - in the numbers of genuinely unemployed people who want to work and who are desirous of keeping themselves and not becoming a drain on the community, that increase of $7.25 a week over the last 10 years should be looked at very seriously by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I  regret to say that today many people are at universities not because they wanted to go there and not because they should have gone there but because the children of neighbours are going there and dad or mum said: ‘I have to send my <span class="highlight">child</span> to university otherwise I wilt be downgraded in the eyes of the neighbours’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a proportion of the students, ranging from 33 per cent to 50 per cent in some cases, either leave university or fail to complete their degree courses, are we not entitled to say to the universities: ‘Something is wrong, and before you ask for more money so that every <span class="highlight">child</span>, whether fitted or not, can go to university, you should put your houses in order’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can only say to parents who may be listening that in my view they would be doing their <span class="highlight">child</span> a favour by keeping the <span class="highlight">child</span> at school for an extra year at matriculation level because when he went to the university he would be infinitely more mature and infinitely better equipped to cope with a university education and get the best from it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is something more than was received by the pensioners, the recipients of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and people who are unable to get a pension because they have been provident enough to subscribe to superannuation or other schemes which gave them a pension sufficient to debar them from getting an age pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Tt is thought that the interest of society in the protection of the <span class="highlight">child</span> in this kind of situation should outweigh the interest society has in protecting the institution of marriage by not forcing a loyal spouse to testify against an accused husband or wife. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 55 provides that either party to a marriage may give evidence tending to prove that the spouses did not have sexual relations with each other at a particular time, but a party is not compellable to give such evidence if it would show, or tend to show, that a <span class="highlight">child</span> born to the wife during the marriage was illegitimate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that this type of <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance which is attached particularly to the unemployed received the attention of the Government in the last year, but so fast has been the growth of inflation, so rapid has been the deterioration, one feels that, with the accompaniment of inflation and the incidence of unemployment, this one section should not be asked to accept the double burden, lt it; for that reason that we commend this proposition to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I recently informed senators in reply to a question by  Senator Turnbull,  my Department has been giving a great deal of attention to the consideration of safety containers and other forms of packaging drugs such as strip packaging, which would have the effect of making the ingestion of these drags in any quantity, particularly by children, more difficult. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is only in very recent years that medical science has turned its attention to the study of malnutrition, including post natal malnutrition, and how it can affect the mental processes of a <span class="highlight">child</span> as it grows. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A <span class="highlight">child</span> which suffers from malnutrition in the first 12 years of its life may be handicapped for the rest of its life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many people in the medical profession say that a <span class="highlight">child</span> can be handicapped as a result of not receiving .sufficient protein in its early years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, the medical profession is only just beginning to undertake thorough research into the likely effects of something like that on a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For those reasons, I think it is important for children to be examined medically in their formative years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all it would be no sacrifice for those who decide not to take their children to a public health centre or who are discouraged from doing so because they live a long distance away from one to make sure that a complete medical examination is made of their children 3 or 6 months after they are born or at a particular time at which the medical profession considers it is possible for any of the abnormalities to which I have been referring to be diagnosed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that way a <span class="highlight">child</span> which has an ailment such as deafness would miss no more than is absolutely necessary the enormously creative years when the brain is capable of absorbing so much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All teachers in all schools educating the handicapped should have sufficient background to recognise the common learning problems of the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> and should be able to refer those children with the more serious problems to special classes or to special schools at a very early age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These grants should be expressed in per capita terms and be set at a nominated percentage of the assessed cost of educating a <span class="highlight">child</span> in government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After careful consideration of the level of support which would be appropriate in all the circumstances, the Government has decided to recommend to each State that it join with the Commonwealth in sharing equally the cost of making per capita grants to independent schools at a rate equivalent to 40 per cent of the assessed Australia-wide cost of educating a <span class="highlight">child</span> in the government primary and secondary schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Putting it another way, the present rates of Commonwealth and State assistance are equivalent to about 29 per cent of the cost of educating a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a government primary school and 23 per cent for a government secondary school compared with the 40 per cent for both primary and secondary schools the Government now proposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I preface my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Services by saying that no doubt the Minister is aware of a chart showing income from government pensions, benefits and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, which was printed by the University of Melbourne Institute of Applied Economics and Social Research and which compares income from pensions with the income required to reach the poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The chart shows, amongst other things, that a single male pensioner requires an additional $5 a week to reach the poverty line,  and that an invalid pensioner with a wife and 2 children needs and additional $15 a week to reach the poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth in addition pays  $8  a week for his wife and $4.50 a week for each <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a <span class="highlight">child</span> is old enough to attend a school at which full-time education is provided, expenses incurred by the mother in connexion with the full-time education of the <span class="highlight">child</span> at the school are allowed as deductions up to a maximum amount of $400 per annum for each such <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No deduction is allowable where the <span class="highlight">child</span> attends an establishment which merely provides a <span class="highlight">child</span> minding service and is not a school providing full-time education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the housekeeper provision, a taxpayer who is a deserted wife or widow may be allowed a deduction of up to $312 per annum if a housekeeper is wholly engaged throughout the year in keeping house for the taxpayer and in caring for a <span class="highlight">child</span> of the taxpayer less than 16 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>The question of allowing deductions to working mothers for <span class="highlight">child</span> minding expenses generally is a matter which will be considered during the preparation of the next Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the position under the State laws is that for an adoption which occurs overseas to be recognised in any of the States of the Commonwealth, the parents who are adopting must be overseas at the time the adoption occurs, and comparably, if an adoption is to be recognised in a State of the Commonwealth, both the parents and the <span class="highlight">child</span> who is to be adopted have to be resident in the State in which the adoption is to be recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If amongst those habits is the taking out of a box of cigarettes, the selection of a cigarette, the passing between mother and father of cigarettes and then the lighting up and smoking of them, the <span class="highlight">child</span> has been subjected to the most powerful and effective influence in the form of advertising of tobacco smoking that it possibly can ever face in any period in its own lifetime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we wish to curtail the effectiveness of cigarette advertising, first we must try to reach parents to show them that this habit, expressed by indulgence in front of their children, inevitably creates most fertile soil for the continuance of the habit in those children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those parents who wish to help their children to resist following the habits of others by smoking cigarettes - those children may consider cigarette smoking to be a social grace - can do so effectively if they take such advertisements and use them to illustrate the complete ridiculousness of the suggestions that are contained in the use of flowing water as being a cool and effective thing as related to cigarette smoking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general intelligence of the <span class="highlight">child</span> will accept the fact that this is ridiculous and the <span class="highlight">child</span> will begin to consider cigarette smoking as something ridiculous rather than as something towards which to aspire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Treasurer’s typical family man - the average wage earner with a wife and 2 children - pays a higher proportion of his income in tax under the McMahon Government than under any government in our history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As any <span class="highlight">child</span> knows, the remaining money that goes to the people who have the responsibilities buys less under the McMahon Government than under any other government in our history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> endowment remains unaltered and therefore stands further eroded by inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That was the cry whenever the Australian Labor Party suggested better social service payments, better pensions for deserted wives, better <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, abolition of the means test and national superannuation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is completely negative to say that the benefits that have been granted in so many areas to pensioners and to those on lower incomes, the benefits that will be conferred through the various social service measures or through an easing of the means test, through the repatriation benefits that are proposed, the <span class="highlight">child</span> care benefits that we see before us and, indeed, the increase in the home savings grant that will be payable to the younger people in the community, are areas of influence designed to encourage a vote from the rich men in this community, if that is what the Opposition is attempting to say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The appropriation does provide many measures for age and invalid pensions, for widows pensions, for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and for all those other areas of social services which have been part of our Budgets for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Take the example of an 11 year old black girl living in the River Todd with her 20-month old baby; while children are picked up off the streets in Alice Springs, by white louts with carnal knowledge, if not rape on their minds, where are the police? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By the time such a <span class="highlight">child</span> is 20 is it not better to be a prostitute than be raped again - at least she might get a bottle of beer for her agony - she certainly will not get justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was generally accepted by the people who submitted evidence to the Committee in relation to this area of teacher education that the most receptive learning period in a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s life is between the ages of 3 and 8 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It shows that the taxpayers, every man jack of them - every man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> in this country - will pay to the Commonwealth this financial year, the .me starting as from 1st July 1972, and the one we are discussing with respect to the current Budget, an additional $38 per head in tax to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, the really big welfare deficiency in this Budget - this has been the case in most of the recent LiberalCountry Party budgets - was the failure to increase the rate of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment or to do anything about <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only effective way in which to help the family man is through <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We now can include in this, since we have equal pay for the sexes, the unmarried woman who has neither chick nor <span class="highlight">child</span> to keep but who receives the same wage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have no objection to mothers being free to work if they want to do so, but by failing to increase <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment the Government has positively disadvantaged those mothers who wish to give full time care to their families, and particularly to their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any citizen in Australia who chooses to send his <span class="highlight">child</span> to an independent school will receive second class education because the Labor Party has said this through  Mr Whitlam’s  mouth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a matter of fact, I put a question to one witness who appeared before our Committee; I do not remember the exact words but what I asked him went something like this: ‘Whom would you prefer to have teaching your <span class="highlight">child</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that not only the members of the Committee but also the Senate, because the Committee is the <span class="highlight">child</span> of the Senate, can say that the document itself is an important one; that Within Australia it does bring together a collection of ideas, thoughts and recommendations that have not been brought together in a library of thought before; and that it does pose a series of challenges as well as a series of recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The idea was that secondary school teaching is fundamentally more skilled and more important but more and more educators are saying that the hungry mind, the hunger of curiosity, the expanding of the intellect, the adventure in education of the <span class="highlight">child</span>, comes much younger still and that one should be looking to primary and pre-school centres, really, to which to apply the top skills of the really highly educated and the special teachers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These ‘other areas’ include much better personal income tax concessions and rate reductions, easing of estate and gift duties, sizable grants for a wide range of education services and provisions for non-profit , <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, about which I offer  a ‘  warning to plan and administer well and with great care and wisdom for grave dangers lie therein. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that it is a discredit to the Government of this country when we can pick up a newspaper printed in the second biggest capital city in Australia and see photographs of a <span class="highlight">child</span> with his backbone and ribs sticking out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It provides for the establishment of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, for increases in homes savings grants, for new facilities for the care of the aged, for travel assistance for unemployed persons, for Aboriginal advancement, for enormous increases in the housing, health and education programmes for Aboriginals, for improvement in the estate duty situation and, of course, for a very widespread education programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  attitude reminded me somewhat of a curious <span class="highlight">child</span> who wanted to know something and who could not find out and because he could not find out that he wanted to know and what so many other people wanted to know he was being irked by it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If I may be permitted to read from documents which have been presented to me by the Isolated Children’s Parents Association, I will indicate what are the matters that that Association considers might well come before the committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, there is the definition of an isolated <span class="highlight">child</span>, and it falls into a few categories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those children travelling excessive distances (by private car and then school bus) over unformed/unsealed roads, where such travelling imposes excessive hardship on parent or <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> from isolated areas who needs remedial education at special schools (available only in capital cities, and in some cases only interstate), . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No parent will willingly send a <span class="highlight">child</span> to boarding school before it is essential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most parents prefer their children to attend a local school up to the grade where it is possible, or even to do the work by correspondence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, it is extremely difficult to try to conduct, on some basis, a correspondence course for a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a mother is required to teach a <span class="highlight">child</span> for 6 or 7 hours a day she is virtually doing the work of the Education Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I presume that  Senator Cavanagh  has in mind the fact that this involves a separation of the <span class="highlight">child</span> from the parents and perhaps involves the <span class="highlight">child</span> living in a non-domestic atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this is the old conflict between a <span class="highlight">child</span> going to day school and living at home and a <span class="highlight">child</span> going to boarding school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many parents think that there is no substitute for the continuous residence of the <span class="highlight">child</span> in the home and the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s attendance at day school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It entails the separation of the <span class="highlight">child</span> from the parents, except during holidays. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know that it has trespassed unduly upon the relationship between <span class="highlight">child</span> and parent in the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, whatever is done, supervision of the <span class="highlight">child</span> student in the home is required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The organisation to which  Senator Byrne  has referred has said that a governess to supervise even one <span class="highlight">child</span> in School of the Air work would cost $1,200 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">child</span> cannot be left to answer the teacher on the School of the Air broadcast and to communicate with the teacher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am suggesting that if this motion is successful one of the terms of reference of the Standing Committee should be to inquire into the way in which educational television and educational broadcasting services can be utilised to a much fuller extent than they are at present, as a means of overcoming the problems of children in isolated areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Government and the Parliament must go out of their way to assist wherever they can to overcome the problems of children of the outback. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These problems concern families, the children of men and women from all walks of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">child</span> in the outback is at a great disadvantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have received correspondence from the Isolated Children’s Parents Association which caters for outback children, mostly those in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I visited the school at Katherine in the Northern Territory where a paid tutor was employed to educate the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I watched an entire lesson during which he asked questions and received replies from the children for which he allocated marks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other than the lack of visual aids, the lesson was similar to the lesson any <span class="highlight">child</span> would have in an ordinary school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recognise that children in such places spend only a small part of their time undergoing education and that there could be some children who could not participate in the class every day because of flat batteries in their wirelesses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Similarly, deductions available for maintenance of a student, an invalid relative and for one <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 years of age will each move up from $208 to $260. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For other children under 16 deductions will be increased from $156 to $208. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One has only to visit Aboriginal reserves in New South Wales, Queensland, the Northern Territory or Western Australia to see the deficiencies in the health of little Aboriginal children under 5 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Queensland a number of doctors of national fame, including a couple of doctors of international fame, has said that, if a <span class="highlight">child</span> is deprived in its first 5 years of life, it is likely to be mentally retarded, a slow learner and not able to cope with all the problems of adult life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One weeps for the future of these children when one sees the chronic ear, nose and throat infections that these youngsters suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, we believe that large family, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and maternity allowances should be greatly increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They lack the knowledge to know that a <span class="highlight">child</span> of 3, 4 or 5 years of age whose little stomach is filled with a beverage which consists of brewed tea with perhaps half a pound of sugar placed in the billy has no desire to eat and suffers malnutrition because its diet is completely inadequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a <span class="highlight">child</span> does not cry, as a hungry <span class="highlight">child</span> will cry, they naturally presume that it is fed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The children are very much prized and loved in their families as they are in our families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One cannot take the children away from the influence of their mothers, and no-one will advocate that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One cannot take the <span class="highlight">child</span> in an environment such as this and shove the necessary foods down its throat, because the first time that the <span class="highlight">child</span> gets ill what happens in the tribal circle is that the white man is condemned for the fact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even if he puts a needle into the little bodies somewhere to give the children the necessary treatment superstition is then introduced and the Aborigines say that this is what killed the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The main elements in educational services for the migrant community include, in the first instance, the <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education programme, then the adult migrant education programme, the full time intensive English language courses as well as the well tried and successful pre-embarkation and shipboard instruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I take a moment to look, first, at the <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A total of approximately $5m to which I referred earlier is provided in the current Budget for the <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only am I talking in terms of money, rather am I drawing attention to the fact that the number of children who may take part in this has grown from approximately 8,000 some 2 or 3 years ago to 40,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The amount up to which a pensioner’s income may be reduced for means test purposes for each dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> is to be increased by $2 to $6 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720921_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 2 related areas we will increase by $2 to $6 a week the maximum deduction allowed from a pensioner’s income for each dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> and, in addition, provide a special concession for recipients of superannuation payments and annuities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720921_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A widow with one <span class="highlight">child</span> whose property does not exceed $4,500 may have income from other sources of up to $20 a week, or up to $26 a week if she receives no income for the <span class="highlight">child</span>, and still receives the full pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720921_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the latter case, some pension will be payable until her income reaches $83.00 a week or $87.00 a week if the <span class="highlight">child</span> is under 6 or an invalid <span class="highlight">child</span> requiring full-time care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720921_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If income does not affect the pension she may have property to the value of $12,400 and still receive a full pension; pension ceases to be payable when the value of her property reaches $37,360 or $39,440 if she has a <span class="highlight">child</span> under 6 or an invalid <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720921_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A widow without children whose property is less than $420 in value may have income of up to $20 a week and still receive the full pension of $17.25 a week; some pension will be payable until her income reaches $54.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720921_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Put the other way, where her means consist entirely of property a widow without children may have assets to the value of $10,800 and still receive a full pension; some pension will be payable until her property reaches $28,740 in value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720921_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, every single age or invalid pensioner without children whose pension under the present law is reduced because of the means test will, under this Bill, receive an increase of up to $6.75 a week if receiving pension at the standard rate or up to $5.60 a week, each, if a married pensioner couple without children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720921_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the Repatriation Bill, as previously explained, in the case of certain children receiving full-time education, amendments are being made in respect of the continuation of their pensions until the age of 21 is reached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720921_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From 1949, the last year in which the Labor Party was in government, right down to the present day there has been no increase in the Si a week paid in respect of the second <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Certainly, the Menzies Administration, shortly after it came to office, in its 1950 Budget provided for a new payment of 50c a week for the first <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since 1949 the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments for the first and second children have remained static. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It took the Government from 1949 until the 1964 Budget to increase the payment for the third <span class="highlight">child</span> to $1.50 a week and until the 1971 Budget - 7 budgets later - to increase it to $2 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One finds children of even well to do families dropping out from the higher level of education and giving up scholarships, because despite their parents’ income, of which they are not necessarily beneficiaries, they arc denied the necessary living allowances that are made available to other members of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>And the Senate is also of the opinion that this Bill should have provided for increases in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment rates and maternity allowances which are long overdue for adjustment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government, of course, provided for increases in the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment rates for the third and successive children in the 1971 Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At end of motion add -  but the Senate is of the opinion that a just, adequate and comprehensive social welfare system can be achieved only by the creation of a contributory national superannuation scheme and that pending the establishment of such a scheme, pension rates should be determined by an independent tribunal of experts including pensioner representation, and the Senate is also of the opinion that this Bill should have provided for increases in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment rates and maternity allowances which are long overdue for adjustment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely no-one would suggest that the one increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment over 12 months ago or the increased maternity allowances are adequate or thai the increases have been sufficient to cope with the inflation that has taken place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is where the real figure juggling takes place -  of deceased ex-servicemen whose deaths were related to war service will have been increased even more substantially, by 36.1 per cent in the case of a first <span class="highlight">child</span>, and 72.9 per cent in the case of second and subsequent children, . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As my personal reaction was that this advertisement gave an impression of exploitation of a <span class="highlight">child</span>, has he any information as to the form that future advertisements will take? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A similar provision applies with respect to a student, a first <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 years of age or to an invalid relative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This points, I hope, to a more realistic assessment of what  is  needed as a deduction for dependants, such as a wife, parent, <span class="highlight">child</span>, student <span class="highlight">child</span> or invalid relative, because at the level of $364 for a non-income earning dependant this is not a very great allowance by which the taxpayer can reduce his taxable income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our attitude in this matter is based on more than a belief that every <span class="highlight">child</span> has a right to a basic level of support from governments in education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should add that it is very difficult for the parent of a <span class="highlight">child</span> at a nongovernment school to accept the argument that everyone has the right to a complete government-provided education in a government school, but that they lose any right the moment they decide to send their children to a non-government school whether it be for a religious, geographic or any other reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will he agree that  Mr Frank  Crean, in the address that  Mr Crean  gave in Sydney on 4th August, when referring to taxation deductions for life assurance was merely drawing attention to the fact that the taxation law allows a taxation deduction of up to $1,200 for life assurance but allows only a little over$300 for a wife who is wholly maintained by a taxpayer and even less for a <span class="highlight">child</span> who is wholly maintained by a taxpayer, and that  Mr Crean,  far from saying that the life assurance deduction should not be allowed, was merely using it as an illustration to highlight the unfairness, disparities and anomalies that exist under the present taxation law relating to allowable deductions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of yesterday’s High Court ruling that Miss Lodge, a working single mother, was not entitled to deduct the cost of her <span class="highlight">child</span>’s day nursery fees for taxation purposes, will the Government urgently consider introducing legislation to allow such expenses as a taxation deduction? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister agree that because of the increased numbers of working women with children who have to be cared for, such a change in the law would be greatly desirable in the national interest as well as in justice to working mothers who relieve the community of social service payments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It follows the question asked by  Senator Little  with regard to assistance for widowers or deserted husbands for <span class="highlight">child</span> care expenses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister also pursue the difficulty of such persons with regard to other forms of supplementary assistance which could be granted to offset the great problems which are faced by widowers and deserted husbands in the care of young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In any case where it is shown to the satisfaction of a Board consisting of the Commissioner, the Secretary to the Treasury and the Comptroller-General of Customs or of such substitutes for all or any of them as the Minister appoints from time to time that the exaction of the full amount of duty payable in respect of so much of an estate as is received by the widow or widower, or by a <span class="highlight">child</span>, of the deceased will entail serious hardship to the widow, widower or <span class="highlight">child</span>, the Board may release the administrator or other person liable to pay the duty wholly or in part from his liability in respect of that duty and the Commissioner may make such entries as are necessary to give effect to that determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the proposition that a serious hardship may be caused to a widow, widower or <span class="highlight">child</span> is not, in the true sense of the legal concept of this matter, applicable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ultimate beneficiaries - the widow, widower or <span class="highlight">child</span>, the people referred to in  Senator Negus’s  amendment - cannot be construed as suffering a hardship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third amendment would authorise a board constituted under a new Section 48a to grant relief from payment of duty where the exaction of the full amount of duty would entail serious hardship to the widow, widower or <span class="highlight">child</span> of the deceased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As envisaged by  Senator Negus  a relief board constituted under the estate duty law would be empowered to remit duty in cases where exaction of the full amount would result in serious hardship to the widow, widower or <span class="highlight">child</span> of the deceased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The hardship has to result to the widow or widower or to the <span class="highlight">child</span> of the deceased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>widow, the widower or the <span class="highlight">child</span> in cases of hardship - for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>We have heard that very few would be affected but somewhere in this wide continent of Australia there may be someone who would face extreme hardship - a distressed widow, a widower or a <span class="highlight">child</span> of the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is another reason why I am so critical of the fact that we have estate duties which tend to whittle away much of the goodwill and security that the parent wishes to leave for a <span class="highlight">child</span> or that a husband wishes to leave for his spouse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second is to increase the per capita payments towards the running costs of independent schools to a nominated percentage - 40 per cent - of the assessed cost of educating a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a government school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I am saying is that when public moneys are set aside for education they ought to be spent equally on all children without discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, if a millionaire were to send his <span class="highlight">child</span> to a state school, the Labor Party would be quite happy to meet the total cost of the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, if that wealthy parent chooses to educate his <span class="highlight">child</span> at a private school, the Labor Party would pay no part of the cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Labor Party accepts the principle that a parent has the right to choose the kind of education he wishes for his <span class="highlight">child</span> and if the taxpayers’ money is set aside for educational purposes, surely that money ought to be spent equally on a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a private school and on a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a state school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that period it was the DLP, and the DLP alone, which advocated such payments, and now it is the DLP which says - and apparently the Government has agreed - that these per capita payments ought to be based on the cost of educating a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a government school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The payment ought to be the same as the cost of educating a <span class="highlight">child</span> in the state system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But let us always remember that if he thinks a school is not sufficiently good for his <span class="highlight">child</span>, and that his <span class="highlight">child</span> can be improved by going to a greater public school, he has the wherewithal to send his <span class="highlight">child</span> to that school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us take the example referred to by  Senator Kane  of the <span class="highlight">child</span> with wealthy parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the parent decides to send his <span class="highlight">child</span> to a state secondary school and he believes that the school is not of a sufficient standard despite the amount of taxation he might be paying for the education of his <span class="highlight">child</span> and every other <span class="highlight">child</span>, the fact remains, if he has the wherewithal, that he is financially able to improve the educational standard of his <span class="highlight">child</span> by sending him to a greater public school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if he chooses not to do that, if he is not satisfied that the education that his <span class="highlight">child</span> is receiving is sufficient, he can then afford private tuition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great number of such children are receiving private tuition at the rate of$1 95 a quarter or whatever the charge may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the man is wealthy and paying the maximum rate of taxation,again the community is subventing him by way of taxation deduction at a much greater rate than that for a man in a comparable position who sends his <span class="highlight">child</span> to a state public school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A man in humble circumstances is unable to afford the additional education for his <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to equity in the educational system, it is heavily loaded in favour of the <span class="highlight">child</span> of the wealthy parent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that for the system of education existing in Australia for all children there should be established an Australian schools commission to iron out on a national basis where the principal needs are so that a system of equity can be brought about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will examine and determine the needs of every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> in government and nongovernment schools whether they be primary, secondary or technical schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having ascertained the priority of needs in order to bring about some standard of equity in the educational system, it will then recommend grants which the Commonwealth should make to the States, cutting out all this malarkey about centralisation and unification to assist andto meet the requirements of all school age children on the basis of needs and priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, as has been said, the members of the Government and the Australian Democratic Labor Party believe that every <span class="highlight">child</span> is entitled to the right to education and that every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> has an equal right to educational opportunity, they have no alternative but to support the amendment moved by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this debate the important point has been missed; that is that we are considering children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether they go to private or public schools, we have to consider the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should consider the <span class="highlight">child</span> irrespective of his colour, background or parents and ask whether we can educate him to the maximum of his capacity, not only for the good life for him but also for what he can contribute to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we look at it as a whole we see that those involved are not merely those children who go to one or two schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard a lot recently about country children, and they are a group that we must look at. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must consider also Aboriginal children, deaf children, spastic children - there are examples of spastic children who can benefit from university education, if they are given the opportunity to do so - children suffering from dyslexia, and migrant children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately this Government has not insisted that migrant children speak English, and some of them who have attended school have been unable to grasp the language because of their natural shyness and so drop back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> of the athiest may turn out to be a devout religionist while the <span class="highlight">child</span> of a devout religionist may turn out to be an athiest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While today the use of the word booze’ in the Senate is not out of place and  Senator Jessop  cannot see any harm in it, it is incredible that a State Minister would suggest - this is the way it was put last week - that parents would spend the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance on booze, or words to the effect as read by  Senator Bishop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suggestion was made that a grant should be made to the parents of each <span class="highlight">child</span>, but the Minister of Education could not agree with this because he thought it might not be utilised for the purpose for which it was granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister pointed out that the scheme of the South Australian Government for the outback children is possibly one of the most generous schemes in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gives more to the parents of the outback children than does any other scheme in  operation in any State of Australia under a Liberal dominated government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the correspondence I have received from the parents of outback children has requested some concessions in the form of taxation deductions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who send their children to school receive an allowance for school fees, but a person who cannot send his children to school cannot receive the allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides an allowance for the children who attend school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It permits a <span class="highlight">child</span> to attend school, and gives them a better opportunity than have outback children in the other States of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>its indifference to indefensible levels of neonatal, infant and <span class="highlight">child</span> mortality, malnutrition and disease: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, these education grants cannot be made available until a <span class="highlight">child</span> reaches 14 years of age, and there are many youngsters attending primary school whose parents need financial assistance to keep the children at school in order to give them a reasonable education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The part of the amendment to which I object most of all is that part which charges the Government with indifference to indefensible levels of neo-natal, infant and <span class="highlight">child</span> mortality, malnutrition and disease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that environment the children and the infants were regularly breast fed until they were 4 or 5 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we can understand now from our knowledge of nutrition, in the new environment the children gradually have been lacking the nourishment that was required to sustain them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They caught lizards, grubs and moths, all of which the infants and very young children ate as they were caught - raw. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the <span class="highlight">child</span> does not cry from hunger, they think the <span class="highlight">child</span> is not hungry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today instead of getting the type of food it used to get, the <span class="highlight">child</span> gets a cup full of tea which is half sugar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> does not cry, but it is not nourished, lt receives no protein and is suffering badly from malnutrition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to correct it, can we take the <span class="highlight">child</span> away from the mother? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These people love their children as much as any other human race loves its children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps they love their children more because they live closer to them and they will not be separated from their children, whether we like it or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Everything is all right if the <span class="highlight">child</span> recovers from a bacl stomach ailment after it has been injected with something, but if the <span class="highlight">child</span> dies very often the medical man, because of the mythology of the tribe, can be blamed in some way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that there is  a  very great difference between gross income and taxable income and that under the Australian Labor Party’s scheme a man supporting a wife and one <span class="highlight">child</span> on $43.40 per week would pay no contribution for health insurance but is currently required to pay53 cents per week under the Government’s plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill give effect to the announcement by the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden)  in his Budget Speech on 15th August last of the Government’s intention to bring down legislation concerning <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government initiative is a tangible expression of its very real and proper concern for the welfare of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the legislation is to ensure the development of <span class="highlight">child</span> day care facilities of good quality throughout the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Included in the concept ‘good quality’ are both the physical arrangements and the professional staffing, in the provision of which the overriding consideration will be the emotional, intellectual and physical development of children in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its work has included an investigation relating to needs in <span class="highlight">child</span> care, particularly the needs of working mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its studies covered developments in the field of <span class="highlight">child</span> day care in most other industrialised countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further research programmes instigated in the Department of Labour and National Service and elsewhere subsequently indicated the parameters of the problem of <span class="highlight">child</span> day care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most importantly, they revealed that <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities had not kept pace with the rapid growth in the female labour force during the 1960s, and that, as a consequence, existing <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities were inadequate, qualitatively and quantitatively, for the growing numbers of children needing them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only were there too few centres but in many cases the provision was only for <span class="highlight">child</span> minding and not for the quality of <span class="highlight">child</span> care appropriate to the educational, emotional and developmental needs of the young children involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During this examination the committee had the benefit of consultations with State government departments and with representatives from a wide range of local government, professional and voluntary groups and organisations throughout Australia concerned with day care arrangements for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These consultations revealed, among other things, thai <span class="highlight">child</span> care which was beneficial to the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s overall development was prohibitively costly for the large body of parents, and secondly, that the <span class="highlight">child</span>-minding arrangements that most parents could afford fell far short of the quality that was required in the interests of <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While many working mothers were able to make satisfactory arrangements for their children during working hours, a substantial number were not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>partly because of a shortage of <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities and partly because of the cost, lt became evident that only through Government action could the problems that had developed in relation to <span class="highlight">child</span> care be met within an appropriate time scale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In summary, the Government decided that action was urgently needed: action lo ensure sufficient good quality <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities in the community for the proper care and development of pre-school aged children whose parents or guardians are unable, for a variety of reasons, to make other suitable arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These facilities should be available at a cost that is not prohibitive to parents, especially to parents of children in special need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is important to acknowledge that this initiative comprehends assistance at 3 levels - that of the <span class="highlight">child</span>, of the family, and of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason there will be no static approach to the concept of <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme is forward-looking and includes provision to stimulate research into all factors relating to the needs of the community in relation to the care of children, and for experiments in various <span class="highlight">child</span> day care methods, lt is the Government’s intention to ensure an ongoing evaluation of both the short-term and longterm effects of the measures which this Bill will make possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it is the view of authorities concerned with <span class="highlight">child</span> care, for example the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Psychiatry Section of the Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, that alternate care, provided for young children while their mothers are working, which is inadequate and unsatisfactory, can contribute to emotional disturbance in the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s later years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of particular concern is the situation where young children are left in the care of untrained and unsupervised <span class="highlight">child</span> minders who do not have the facilities conducive to the social and emotional development of young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, many young children are being taken care of in just such circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the Government’s initiative springs from its concern for the welfare of children of working mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also a fact that at present 25 per cent of mothers with children under 6 years of age are in the labour force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That a substantial number of such mothers cannot make satisfactory arrangements for the care of their pre-school aged children is yet another fact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the scheme is to meet this existing problem - to help the children of working and other parents insofar as they are deprived of proper <span class="highlight">child</span> care either because good quality facilities are not available or because the cost is presently too high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In summary, the Bill provides for assistance to non-profit organisations, including local governing bodies, to establish and operate centres which provide day care for children of working and sick parents and which give priority of admission to children in special need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this purpose children in special need are defined in clause 20 of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed scheme has four main elements, as follows: (i) capital grants; (ii) recurrent grants in respect of qualified staff; (iii) recurrent grants with respect to children in special need; and (iv) grants for research and evaluation of matters relating to <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In summary, unmatched capital grants will be provided and made payable direct to eligible organisations for: (i) the purchase, erection, extension or alternation of buildings, including necessary fixtures, and land cost, for use as a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre; (ii) the purchase and installation of equipment for use in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government regards unmatched grants as the most effective method of ensuring that sufficient new <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres will be built where they are needed most, particularly in areas of greatest social need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provision in the Budget of funds for capital grants in this financial year should enable a substantial expansion of the number of <span class="highlight">child</span> care places in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hoped to establish some 50 new centres catering for some 3,000 <span class="highlight">child</span> care places in the first full year of the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would provide an increase of about 20 per cent in the number of <span class="highlight">child</span> care places available in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For its application for an unmatched capital grant to succeed, a claimant organisation will be required to demonstrate that it is capable of efficiently managing a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre, and that it can bear the responsibility of ensuring the centre’s financial viability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all cases, the acceptance of a capital grant will automatically involve responsibility for running the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre in accordance with the required conditions which I shall deal with later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is provision for recurrent grants to eligible organisations to encourage the employment of certain types of qualified staff in specified numbers in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where there are  15  or more children  3  years of age or over enrolled full-time, the grant will be in respect of one pre-school teacher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the first  20  children  3  years of age or over, the grant will be in respect of one qualified nurse for every  20  children or part thereof. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is provision for grants in respect of additional pre-school teachers in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres accommodating more than a prescribed number of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Younger children under  3  years of age have other and more demanding needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The grant will be available for a qualified nurse employed in a centre for every  10  such children or part thereof for which the centre has enrolments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of children in this context refers to children enrolled for  8  hours during the day in a centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill includes provision for the calculation of the grant to be made in such a way as to take into account the varying hours that different children might attend centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus under the scheme, opportunities will exist for children aged between  3  and  5  years in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres to receive pre-school education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, setting of standards for the employment of qualified persons in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres is  a  function of State or local governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for special recurrent grants to enable centres to offer reduced fees in respect of enrolled children from low income and other families in financial need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been suggestions from time to time that attendance at <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres should be free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fees normally charged to parents of children not in financial need will be of the order presently being charged in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For these fees, however, children will enjoy in government assisted centres  a  quality of care superior to that otherwise available because of the nature of the facilities and the qualified staff provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basis of the method will be that an organisation operating a centre will receive payments with respect to children in special need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this purpose, ‘children in special need’ is defined in the Bill - clause  12  - as children of one parent families, of families in the first  3  years of settlement in Australia, of families where one of the parents is sick or incapacitated, and of families eligible to receive assistance under the subsidised health benefits scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The level of the grant paid to organisations operating centres in respect of each <span class="highlight">child</span> in special need may be up to some  $8  per week per <span class="highlight">child</span> under  3,  and some  $6  per week per <span class="highlight">child</span>  3  years of age and over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The maximum rate per hour of attendance per <span class="highlight">child</span> that may be paid to an organisation will be prescribed by regulation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The circumstances of families placing children in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres cannot be predicted in advance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a scheme of this nature, that relates to the development and care of children, every opportunity must be made to ensure that organisations assisted can operate their <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres with compassion and with the capacity to help the most needy cases as they arise from time to time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, it will be the responsibility of organisations operating centres to balance their own financial budgets, taking into account the recurrent grants that will be made available - both in respect of staffing - and with respect to children in special need the fees they can collect, and their other sources of income, if any, against their outgoings for salaries, maintenance of equipment and buildings and other current expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present in Australia there are some 80 <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres operated on a nonprofit basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of these grants the scheme will come into operation when the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act receives royal assent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to provide <span class="highlight">child</span> care on such days and during such hours as the Minister determines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intention of the first of these conditions is to ensure that preference in admission is given to those in greatest need of <span class="highlight">child</span> day care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Organisations in receipt of grants will be required to operate the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres concerned for the benefit of the community in which they are located and generally to the satisfaction of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will, of course, be obvious to honourable senators that organisations seeking capital grants will have to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Minister that a need for the new or additional <span class="highlight">child</span> day care facilities exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for  a  <span class="highlight">child</span> care standards committee to be set up to advise the Minister on the range of facilities that will  be  covered  by the  unmatched capital grants  to  organisations,  on  the standard of these facilities and on the service provided in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres in receipt of grant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In considering appropriate facilities and their standard the committee will, of course, have regard to the standards for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres required by State legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The committee may also be asked to advise on other matters referred to it in connection with the <span class="highlight">child</span> care scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> care standards committee will be assisted by committees in each State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hoped that it will be possible to include officers of relevant State Government departments who can advise on the facilities that should be provided, on the best approach to the development of children in centres, and as to the geographical areas that are in greatest need of additional <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government intends to ensure that developments in its provision for <span class="highlight">child</span> care continue to have regard to the wide variety of views that are known to exist in the community on the subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One practical application of this proposition will be studies to review how the scheme provided for in this legislation is meeting the needs of the <span class="highlight">child</span>, the family and the community, and to identify inadequacies, if any. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second expression of the Government’s concern about future developments is the provision for research to explore the very large field of <span class="highlight">child</span> care, particularly as it relates to day care, and related areas such as after-school and holiday care for school-aged children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is uncommitted as to the eventual directions in which its assistance toward <span class="highlight">child</span> day care may develop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One area that will inevitably attract investigation is alternative forms of <span class="highlight">child</span> day care such as family day care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also worthy of study is the motivation for mothers of young children to continue to care for their own children in their own homes rather than to enter paid employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in this regard what is the persuasive influence of appropriate family counselling on mothers of young children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another area that will need development is the form by which the evaluation of <span class="highlight">child</span> care arrangements may proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be possible to involve, say, professionally qualified social workers or sociologists experienced in the <span class="highlight">child</span> care field to work in and around the government assisted <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another important avenue for research relates to the training of staff for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a view, for example, that new forms of training are required to meet the needs of children in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The research would need to concern itself with whether such courses might range from professional to short part-time training arrangements applicable to <span class="highlight">child</span> care personnel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed that this committee be called the <span class="highlight">child</span> care research committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The functions the Government envisages for this committee are to make recommendations regarding applications for grant; to evaluate the direction of the Government’s <span class="highlight">child</span> care scheme when requested and to advise accordingly; to recommend measures for the training of <span class="highlight">child</span> care personnel; to recommend areas for research and experimentation into important aspects of <span class="highlight">child</span> care; and to advise on the application of research findings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children of preschool age should not be deprived of proper care, and the opportunity for the fullest possible development, because their parents are not looking after them themselves at home during the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was confirmed again and again during the consultations which the committee of officers undertook during their examination of the <span class="highlight">child</span> care problem and to which I have already referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude of the working mother is that her presence in the community is a fact and that assistance with the care of her children is a need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its intention is to ensure that the development of its assistance for <span class="highlight">child</span> day care is kept under close review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is pot the Government’s intention to help additional <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres into existence and then forget about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The evaluation will reveal what is happening in the centres and what their impact is on the community, on the families involved and on the children themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> care centres will be community oriented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is basic therefore, that the physical conditions in the centres facilitate and encourage the participation and involvement of parents in the care and development of their children at the centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One responsibility of the <span class="highlight">child</span> care standards committee will be to examine designs for centres to ensure that they incorporate physical features which parents placing their children in a centre can use as a community service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More precisely, parents will be encouraged to see the centre as a place to which they can come to discuss the development of their children with other parents, with the staff in the centre and with qualified professional people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government envisages that if a beginning can be made to turn this legislation into reality quickly, we can look forward to an increase of at least 20 per cent per annum over the next 3 years in the number of places for pre-school children that will be available in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very important for honourable senators to appreciate that, significant though the increase in physical accommodation is, of much greater importance is the provision for improving the quality of <span class="highlight">child</span> care that will be available to the community in future years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under it a scheme is being provided for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres of good quality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The quality of <span class="highlight">child</span> care is important not only for parents who, for one reason or another, choose to work, but is important for all parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In today’s mobile society with families living apart from grandparents and other relatives, there are many who have nowhere to turn when they are ill or in need of assistance with their children during the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> care centres have to be seen in their proper perspective; they are supportive of the family unit and in extreme cases are the alternative to placing children in residential institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the end of motion add, ‘but the Senate is of the opinion - (a) that the Commonwealth Government should take the initiative to establish <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres to meet the needs of working mothers, and should do this on a basis of priorities, to give maximum advantage to a maximum number of families, rather than leave the provision of this service to the chance interest of employers and local authorities, and (b) that <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres should be within the province of the Department of Education and Science, and should be part of a pre-school system developed progressively throughout the nation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>2) 1972- 73 drew attention to the fact that the <span class="highlight">child</span> care scheme will cost the Commonwealth $4.8m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1970 the Commonwealth expressed the view that there was an urgent need for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, and  Mr Gorton  said that he would give the matter very high priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now we have the Government saying that it is prepared to allocate 4.8m in the current financial year for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, that the expenditure will rise to $6.5m in a full year, and that in the first 3 years of the scheme approximately $23m will be made available for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government was prepared to put aside this important question of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> care must concern itself with mental health - an integral part of the problem - with the welfare of working mothers and with their pre-school children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But where we differ from the Government, as we have said in our amendment, is that the Government is making no attempt to provide for the educational or mental health aspects in the establishment of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is placing the responsibility on any well meaning people in the community who are prepared to band together to assist in establishing <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been established beyond any reasonable shadow of a doubt that there is a need for a loving and continuous relationship between any <span class="highlight">child</span> under 3 years of age and its mother or, if the mother is dead or is not able to fill tha: role, some mother image. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is very important for the mental development and subsequently for the personality development of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one considers that at the present time there are 1,261,610 children under 4 years of age in Australia, one can appreciate the great and urgent need to provide <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister in his second reading speech drew attention to the fact that at the present time in Australia there are some 80 <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres operating on a non-profit basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a great indictment it is of our society and of the Commonwealth which took 21 years, to 1970, to realise that there is a social need for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres and which has taken another 2 years - 23 years in total - to bring this legislation before the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this rate, clearly millions of young children in our community will not have the advantages of a proper <span class="highlight">child</span> care relationship with their mother and with other children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In introducing this legislation the Government was not concerned for the <span class="highlight">child</span> or for the mental health of the <span class="highlight">child</span> or the mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great deal of research has been carried out into the area of children under 5 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Plowden report - this was a report in the United Kingdom; the British Government has made many surveys and has carried out a great deal of research in these areas - states:  lt is generally undesirable except to prevent  a  greater link to separate mother and <span class="highlight">child</span> for  a  whole day in a nursery  5  days a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It recommended that mothers of young children should be encouraged to spend as much time as possible with young children or, if there are economic pressures that require a mother to go to work, then governments need to give consideration to the provision of special allowances in the form of financial relief to a mother so that a mother is not separated from a <span class="highlight">child</span> under  4  years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if a government were sincere it would give a substantial allowance to those mothers who would otherwise elect to go to work, to stay at home to care for their young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is recognised that some mothers want <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres for their own self-fulfilment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true, having regard to the state of health of the mother or the state of home and tensions, that some children would benefit from the tensionfree environment which they would probably find in a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, experts say that the overriding consideration is that  3  to  5  years is the most desirable age for the <span class="highlight">child</span> to have a mother relationship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government really wanted to play its part in this area of <span class="highlight">child</span> care and also give some recognition of the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government would find and the community would find that this overall would be in the interests of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Specialists who have studied the problem find that it is difficult to come to any conclusion but I think, largely speaking, that <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres should be established in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth should provide adequate subsidies so that the emphasis is on the educational side and not so much on the raising of finance, which is the principal factor in the activities of the existing <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his second reading speech  Senator Greenwood  drew attention to the fact that about 80 <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres are operating on a nonprofit basis throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is abundant evidence to show that large numbers of privately run <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres are conducted without adequate provision in a backyard fashion by untrained people giving no really detailed or fundamental attention to the development of the personality of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that the legislation seeks to make a movement in the direction of improving this problem by giving some encouragement and initiative to those who are prepared on the industrial level or the local level to establish additional <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the question of providing trained teachers, which I know the Government has recognised as part of the problem, will be a major obstacle to giving every <span class="highlight">child</span> whose mother has to work the right and facility to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, that does not take into consideration those mothers who want to work for their own reasons - not necessarily economic reasons - and who want to avail themselves of the facilities of a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The New South Wales <span class="highlight">Child</span> Welfare Department has expressed concern at the number of unqualified and often indifferent housekeepers and nannies who are caring for children in their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cases occur of children left unattended in cars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are other children not being given any real consideration by the people whose responsibility it is to look after them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes children are left in their homes while a parent working at a nearby factory has an arrangement with the factory to go every so often to check whether they are alive and well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party feels that the only way to put an end to these occurrences is to minimise the charges and establish more <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres of a higher quality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the New South Wales Department of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Welfare existing <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres cater for only 2.8 per cent of pre-school children and only 6 per cent of 3 to 5-year-olds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that about 50 <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres are already operating in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sweden, a frontrunner in this field, aims at catering for 80 per cent of pre-school children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some authorities such as Professor Hugh Philip, Professor of Education at Macquarie University, have expressed doubt that such industrial centres are in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been suggested that one drawback to these proposals is that the employer would gain a lien on the mother, who may tolerate adverse working conditions in return for care of her <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issues of a Bill of this nature are not just those concerned with the caring of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While there is a shortage of places in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, we agree that priority should be given to the children of working mothers and that special arrangements should be made to enable the closest relationship between the working mother and the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in the long term, when these shortages are overcome I feel that free <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres should be available to all mothers so that those who wish to pursue careers and interests in the same manner as men may do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should not be seen only in the limited concept of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>I wish to use the somewhat limited time available at this stage of the session to comment on the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Bill because it concerns an aspect of social matters which has had my close, attention and the close attention of many women’s organisations in Australia for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present about 25 per cent of mothers with children under 6 years of age are working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there are still over 150,000 pre-school children whose mothers work outside the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason I believe that the Government has needed to give attention not only to the matter of <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities but also to the introduction of a measure which will provide adequate <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities for these 150,000 pre-school age children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is not an inducement by the Government to encourage women with preschool age children to enter the work force, but rather I see it as a Government reaction to the social change which has already occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is necessary to look at some of the terms of this Bill and perhaps relate them to the requirements of Australian children and the working mothers of the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many matters of research in other countries have been quoted but I feel very encouraged that there will be a continuing research programme within Australia looking at Australian conditions and deciding what sort of childcare facilities we would like to see provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that establishment of a <span class="highlight">child</span> care standards advisory committee which has been provided for under this Bill to advise the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Lynch)  on the range of facilities that will be covered by the unmatched capital grants is quite important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that we shall have a <span class="highlight">child</span> care standards advisory committee, I believe, will give continuing relevance to the needs of the children and to the needs of the working mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the research which will explore <span class="highlight">child</span> care - that is day care, after school care and holiday care - will also be an important part of the work which needs to be done in Australia, looking at Australian conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have very much a family structure of parents and children rather than the other generations which are involved in some other countries of the world in close living conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The appointment of a <span class="highlight">child</span> care research committee will also be provided for under this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The advisory committee and the research committee seem to me to be 2 aspects of the Bill to which 1 can give support; because whilst there are some 150,000 children who need day care while their mothers are working as a result of social change, T would like to think that we would evaluate, too, the implications of the mother of the pre-school <span class="highlight">child</span> being employed outside the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this Bill it is hoped to establish some 50 new centres catering for, perhaps, 3,000 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at the prospect of 150,000 children in the preschool group, the provision of 3,000 <span class="highlight">child</span> care places in the first year does seem to be rather limiting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I think it would be agreed that if one were to inter pret properly what is needed, 3,000 <span class="highlight">child</span> care places in the first year is an advance on what is already available and maybe it will be the means of determining the best type of <span class="highlight">child</span> care we can provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this Bill also the standards to be set in the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres are to be in the hands of State or local governments and must meet their requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would hope, too, even in accordance with the amendment of the Opposition that the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres would not be simply <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres or maintenance centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to think that they will be developmental of the <span class="highlight">child</span> who spends several hours each day in them, and I feel sure that if there were emphasis on qualified staff this developmental process would be a natural evolution of the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s growth as he or she attended the same centre for several hours each day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would be separation from the mother which I feel would be better catered for if qualified staff were assessing the growth of the <span class="highlight">child</span> in the various stages and were able to develop better the processes through which the <span class="highlight">child</span> could understand and use those several hours each day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 80 <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres which are at present in existence in Australia on a non-profit basis have already some of the facilities that we would see as being necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, [ would hope that the new programme which gives  an  incentive to the qualified staff would enhance the facilities which are available in the future and would mean that these <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres are perhaps more desirable for the care of the younger <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assistance is provided at 3 levels under this Bill: There is assistance to the <span class="highlight">child</span> who  will  be cared for in the centre, assistance to the family and assistance to the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with the medical views which have been expressed this evening that inadequate and unsatisfactory <span class="highlight">child</span> care can contribute to emotional disturbance particularly if  it  is <span class="highlight">child</span> care which is given when the <span class="highlight">child</span>  is  at a tender age - under 3  or  4 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that there is a parental responsibility to be exercised here and that the <span class="highlight">child</span> under 3 or 4 years who would be cared for in the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre would be more likely to be the <span class="highlight">child</span> of a single parent or the <span class="highlight">child</span>  of  a person who  is ill  or incapacitated and who needed the particular opportunity to have specialised care facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason I welcome the provision  in  the Bill that facilities  will  be given  in  priority to those children who have special needs  or  to- those parents who have special needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the children of mothers who are unable to care for them or  of  the single male parent who is occupied in earning income for the family will need to have  Specialised  care such as we envisage  will  be provided under this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one considers the opportunity to give priority to children  in  special need; if one considers the fact that we are establishing a research programme which we believe  will  be a continuing process and which will take  into  account the future needs of Australian children in their own conditions; and  if  one understands that there are these grants to give an incentive to the centres to employ trained staff, then I think honourable senators will agree that the Government has approached what is a social concern in a very practical way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the Government’s approach shows that it places emphasis on the role  of  the family and the responsibility  of  the mother to the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is using this opportunity to set a pattern  of  <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres which  We  hope will be  of  advantage to children, which will enable the mother to  make  her choice as to whether she combines her role of mother and some career. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was of great interest to me to have, the opportunity to talk to someone who had been engaged in the supervision of the Government’s <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres in Finland for some 30 years, I think, and to hear of her experiences and her understanding of this facility which has been provided in that country where the proportion of married women who work and have pre-school children is very high indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a father who has found no generation gap in his family because it was never allowed to develop, 1 shudder when I hear people talk of children under 5 years of age and of the tender age of 3 years being placed in the hands of trained staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Probably, if we searched the statistics, we would find that these young people arc from well adjusted homes and are not children who went to part time orphanages which are now given the very special name of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have tried to take children out of institutionalised circumstances when, because of fate, they have no parents of their own to love them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I listen to the alleged experts who are suggesting that we must institutionalise the care of children where people are forced by circum stances - and even where it is their own desire - to abandon a 3-year-old <span class="highlight">child</span> for 8 hours a day 5 days a week to the care of an institution with expert, trained staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does their training teach such staff to pay personal attention to the individual <span class="highlight">child</span>, with its enormous curiosity about the terrific experience of life and living? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a <span class="highlight">child</span> wants special and personalised care to help it adjust to the challenges and fears which this great world must have for the mind of a 3-year-old <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Such a <span class="highlight">child</span> runs to a well trained expert - who has no personal interest - al the same lime as, perhaps, 10 or 15 other children do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there are such circumstances it is regrettable that we have to create these places rather than having those children cared for in circumstances similar to those which we try to provide for orphans, which is in a home atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She may have no ambition to go out to work and if subsidised she might readily take a third <span class="highlight">child</span> such as a 3-year-old, to share in the love of the family for the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From my experience in dealing with children as a parent, I think this is far more important than knowing the germ content of the water which they may drink. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the destiny of the <span class="highlight">child</span> who comes home after 8 hours in a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre to a mother who is exhausted by 8 hours of employment in a factory or a shop and who is faced with preparing tea for her husband and one, 2 or 3 children as well? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> who goes to the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre for 5 days a week for 8 hours a day, as envisaged in the second reading speech of the Minister, comes home to chaos and confusion, is swept off to bed to sleep, is awakened in the morning to similar chaos and confusion when the family is getting off to work, and in the process is dumped somewhere with strangers who do their best. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> just gets to know and understand the personality of the expert who may be helping it in a part time capacity during the week when it has to adjust to its own parents at home again at the weekend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is this neglect in the form of a lack of food, clothing or shelter, or is it neglect of the time necessary to establish proper relationships - a neglect of time in which the <span class="highlight">child</span> can feel wanted, special and loved in a family circumstance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However many mothercraft nurses there are, when a <span class="highlight">child</span> is taken to a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre where there are a number of ot’-.er children and trained scientific staff, it is in an institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendment states:  thai the  Commonwealth Government should  take the  initiative  to  establish <span class="highlight">child</span>  care centres . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government cannot march into the various States of the Commonwealth and start slapping a Commonwealth-imposed <span class="highlight">child</span> care system on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Members of the Australian Labor Party have suggested that some improvement in the system could be effected by removing the responsibility for <span class="highlight">child</span> care services from the jurisdiction of the States, which may already have at least some knowledge and staff in this field, putting this entire area of welfare - from the far north of Queensland to the depths of Western Australia - under the control of a department of experts in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Indeed, that honourable senators opposite want to take from the State governments the jurisdiction over <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres seems to indicate a lack of confidence in the State Labor governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The circumstances leading up to my moving the motion were as follows:  Senator Little  had said in the course of debate on the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Bill that certain medical practitioners who were Labor members of Parliament had advocated the use of marihuana. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Centres should be within the province of the Department of Education and Science, and should be part of a pre-school system developed progressively throughout the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We would not support a proposal for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres to be placed in the hands of departments of education, even in the various States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The greatest threat in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres is not to the physical well being of the <span class="highlight">child</span> but rather to its mental well-being. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have made suggestions that <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres should be less institutionalised where such care is unavoidable where mothers or widowed fathers are forced to have their children cared for by somebody else during certain vital hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should subsidise private families to fill the gap as that type of care would held less danger of psychiatric damage to the <span class="highlight">child</span> than any institutionalised system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The interest that the Senate has shown in this Bill indicates that it is one of the most important Bills which has come before the Parliament this year.It is one of great interest in relation to <span class="highlight">child</span> care in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that some people in the community must avail themselves of the services of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has levelled this legislation at the quality of those <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its work has included an investigation relating to needs in <span class="highlight">child</span> care, particularly the needs of working mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its studies covered developments in the field of <span class="highlight">child</span> day care in most other industrialised countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are people in the community who very definitely need the assistance of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that all of these matters indicate the necessity for the proper organisation of the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An organisation in Victoria, called the Council for the Single Mother and Her <span class="highlight">Child</span>, is looking for not only assistance from but also recognition by the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any maintenance she receives from the father of her <span class="highlight">child</span> is deducted from that amount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>T wish to deal with one matter which should receive the particular attention of the Senate in relation to <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct the Commonwealth Government’s attention to the views of the Australian Federation of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Associations on this subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much as one may admire those who are willing to do this work for no return to themselves through municipal or church organisations, I put it to the Government that 80 per cent of the <span class="highlight">child</span> care organisations which are established in the community at the present time are professionally oriented <span class="highlight">child</span> care associations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government does not see its way clear to help these organisations by way of assistance towards the payment of the salaries of qualified staff or the making of capital assistance grants, there will be created in our society something which I believe will have an adverse effect on <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, if the assistance provided is aimed purely at those children who are in need insofar as the assets and background of their families are concerned, there will be created an institution for purely that type of <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there should be an integration of the <span class="highlight">child</span> care activities which are being provided at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When that care reaches a standard which is acceptable and competent according to Commonwealth Government or State Government standards, and the institution providing it is recognised as a <span class="highlight">child</span> care institution, that institution should in fact receive the, Commonwealth Government assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt has been suggested by the Australian Federation of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Associations that various undesirable consequences will flow from the Commonwealth Government’s attention to one particular sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to confine my remarks, I seek the concurrence of the Senate to the incorporation in Hansard of the comments which have been made by the very renowned Australian Federation of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Associations on what are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Webster  asked for leave to incorporate a statement made by the Australian Federation of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Associations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Centres which receive Commonwealth assistance must, according to the Bill, give priority of application to children in special need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The immediate consequence of this requirement is that Commonwealthassisted centres will accommodate a disproportionate number of such children in special need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These centres will then take on the special characteristics appropriate to such children, rather than be a reflection of the crosssection of the community within which the children are growing up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus will be generated the undesirable ghetto kind of centre which we have previously mentioned to you (in a letter from the Victorian Association) - a characteristic which we argue is quite unacceptable for all except those children who really need specially protected care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The consequence of the present proposals will be to further strengthen those existing centres which at present have a very strong ‘ghetto’ environment in them, to encourage the establishment of new centres of a similar kind, and to maintain this ghetto’ approach at least until the Commonwealthassisted centres have taken over virtually the whole <span class="highlight">child</span> care field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill as now proposed has immediately put into jeopardy the whole private-commercial sector of the <span class="highlight">child</span> care field - that is, all those centres which at this point of time are caring for the vast majority, (estimated at more than 80 per cent) of all children in day care in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cannot be in the national interest that Parliament should design this important and desirable Bill in such a way as to lead to the destruction of such a large proportion of the existing <span class="highlight">child</span> care field, with its consequent effects on the interests of hundreds of proprietors of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, thousands of staff engaged in those centres, and tens-of-thousands of parents whose children attend these centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was one of the problems facing the Opposition with this Bill because there seemed to be in the minds of a number of people some doubt as to what a <span class="highlight">child</span> care Bill was and whether it also included a pre-school Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A preschool teachers association would be entirely separate from a <span class="highlight">child</span> care association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Senator Little  said that he did not want <span class="highlight">child</span> care for every <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia and that he did not want the sort of system that existed in the Australian Capital Territory, I do not know whether he was aware of the system in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pre-school system in Canberra which caters for a large number of children does not take the children for more than half a day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The children are not separated from their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">child</span> care situation is entirely different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a situation in which the mother has to work and an endeavour is made to give that mother some assistance by looking after the children while she is unfortunately unable to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> care would provide care for the <span class="highlight">child</span> all day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We did not want necessarily to provide <span class="highlight">child</span> care for every <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we would like to see would be a preschool education for every <span class="highlight">child</span>, which is an entirely different proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has recognised some of these points and has written into the Bill the provision that those in charge of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres should be approved by the <span class="highlight">child</span> care association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope the Minister understands the difference between them and knows that a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre is not a pre-school centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment states that <span class="highlight">child</span>  care centres  should be within the province of he Department of Education and Science and should be part of a pre-school system developed progressively throughout the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want the Commonwealth Government to have <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres as one of its priorities, but certainly we want it to separate them from the close relationship which in the future they will have with industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a Bill for an Act to provide for assistance by the Commonwealth in respect of places where children under school age may be cared for during the day and in respect of research in connection wilh the care of children and for related purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Government proposes by this legislation is to provide a sum of money, estimated in the first 3 years of the scheme to be some $23m, which will be expended on capital and recurrent grants for the purposes of establishing these <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another $lm to be provided over the same period will be expended on grants for the purpose of research and evaluation in the area of <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>essential purpose of this Bill is to ensure that what is an existing need is met, and it is designed to meet it by providing for nonprofit organisations which do have <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres or which are prepared to establish <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres the means by which those centres can be financed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard in a quite interesting debate a number of comments by way of support for the project - I think that has been the general view of the Senate - but also we have heard reservations as to whether or not particular lines of development are the best lines upon which the minding of children whose parents are unable to look after them throughout the day should proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention in passing that  Senator Little  suggested that there might be centres in which there is provision for children to be minded in the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, this is an alternative to <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres which are in a sense institutionalised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Little  thought that some provision may be made whereby families can take into their homes children of working parents and other parents who cannot look after them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed <span class="highlight">child</span> care sheme is concerned with the welfare of children, with particular emphasis on the welfare of those children who have special need of alternative care while their parents are working, sick or otherwise unable to care for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a scheme which is designed to encourage mothers and those responsible for the caring of children to put their children into these centres and go out to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the scheme is designed to meet is the existing problem of working mothers and others who are unable to give their children the care that they require throughout the day and to provide a means whereby that care can be provided better than it is being provided at the -moment, to have the proper physical arrangement where children can be looked after, to provide the professional staff who can give the appropriate attention and to do something which is not existing  at  the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The initial research was commenced in 1965. and I think most honourable senators will recall that in late 1968 a document was published by the Department of Labour and National Service concerning the children of working mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will also be remembered that  Mr Gorton,  as Prime Minister, during the Senate campaign at the end of 1970 indicated that the Government intended to introduce a scheme of assistance in respect of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres for children of working mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier this year the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  and also the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Lynch)  indicated that the Government was again giving consideration to this matter and, of course, it was announced in the Budget in August this year that the Government proposed to establish a <span class="highlight">child</span> care scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any such organisation, however, would need to offer priority of admission to children in special need and to be open to serve the community, and not restrict entry into the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre to children of employees in a certain industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> care scheme, moreover, is not restricted to children of working mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children of single fathers and children of parents who are sick and incapacitated or who are otherwise unable to care for their children during the day are eligible for admission to the centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a difference between pre-school centres and <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst there may be a case for pre-school centres being within the administration of the Department of Education and Science, or coming within the overall responsibility of that Department as far as the Commonwealth is concerned, I do not think there is the same case for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres being administered by that Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be appreciated from the second reading speech that one of the things which the Government proposes to establish is a <span class="highlight">child</span> care standards committee which will seek to enable these guidelines to be uniformly applied and which will also enable the appropriate standards to be required as one of the conditions of a grant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have stressed, and I repeat, that the whole scheme is aimed at the proper care and development of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the scheme is to rectify a problem that already exists, namely, that a large number of children are currently being left in a number of unsatisfactory centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time there are 150,000 pre-school children who have mothers who go to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of these women have to make arrangements for the care of their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of that number only about 15,000 are at present located in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter was brought up during the pressure of debate last night when I was discussing the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Bill, lt was not promoted by me but by people who were interjecting while I was speaking about <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister may establish a committee, to be known as the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Standards Committee, which shall consist of such number of members as the Minister thinks fit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important thing is to have on this commitee not simply representatives of unions or employers but persons who, because of their knowledge and their interest, will be able to perform the function of maintaining the <span class="highlight">child</span> care standards which are so important to the way in which these centres are run. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ask: From where does the Government get the constitutional authority for the granting of moneys to <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill provides for a payment by the Commonwealth for the care of children under school age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister is satisfied that they are used the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre is entitled to a grant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been similar schemes, for example with regard to the Aged Persons Homes Acts and assistance to handicapped children, in which the Commonwealth has appropriated money for these purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are in the course of discussing a Bill to appropriate money for <span class="highlight">child</span> day care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision of maternity allowances, widows’ pensions, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, unemployment, pharmaceutical, sickness and hospital benefits, medical and dental services (but not so as to authorise any form of civil conscription), benefits to students and family allowances: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think there is any way that that placitum can be interpreted to include <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not everyone agrees with the establishment of <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot see how the Minister can shelter under that umbrella -  <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fundamental basis of this legislation is the acknowledgment of the fact that there are working mothers and there are parents other than working mothers who cannot look after their children throughout the day and that there ought to be proper physical arrangements and professional staff to provide the type of <span class="highlight">child</span> care in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres which will enable the welfare of these children to be maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The training will be designed to maintain good standards of cleanliness and likewise meet the developmental, emotional and personal needs of all young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres are not to be regarded as either orphanages or institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He indicated that at the present time 80 per cent of all <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres in operation are commercially run. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the important factors to emerge from the wide-ranging consultations which the Government has instituted on <span class="highlight">child</span> care was that the provision of good quality facilities is often an invaluable support to a family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The measures taken by the Government in assisting the community to overcome such problems do in fact provide a number of supports to the family such as the counselling service to be provided to parents of children needing care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government acknowledges that when a mother chooses to go out to work, for whatever reason, her <span class="highlight">child</span> should not be deprived of the opportunity to receive alternative care of a high quality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One point is that the scheme to assist with <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres should be administered by the Department of Education and Science as distinct from the Department of Labour and National Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other point is, in essence, that this scheme should be one in which the Government takes the initiative in running <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres instead of proceeding, as the Government is proceeding, by providing financial assistance by way of capital grants, recurrent grants and other monetary sums to the private nonprofit organisations which will establish these schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that the Commonwealth should not involve itself in the exact running of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the scheme the Government will not be operating the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A main feature of the scheme is its assistance to local organisations to enable them to respond to local needs for <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intention is to help organisations operating <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some places there is concern about whether the Government is not encouraging activity which will lead to children being placed in centres while their mothers are engaged in activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There must be some such risk, but the real concern that the Government has is the welfare of the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present children are not being cared for properly while their parents are at work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the new Commonwealth compensation legislation the weekly payments will be $43 for a single employee, $54 for an employee with a wife, $59 for an employee with a wife and one <span class="highlight">child</span> and $64 for an employee with a wife and 2 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The weekly compensation payments in Victoria are $43 for a single employee, $55 for an employee with a wife and $59 for an employee with a wife and one <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In New South Wales the weekly compensation payment is $43 for a single employee and there is an allowance of $11 for a wife and an allowance of S5 for each dependant <span class="highlight">child</span>, which is the same as under the Commonwealth legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendments propose to alter the definition of ‘<span class="highlight">child</span>’, ‘dependant’ and widow’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, I arn required to consider Bills for  5  departments and, as honourable senators will know, I was engaged last night on a matter connected with the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Bill  1972  which led to some controversy and which absorbed all my time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>of this section, as is reasonably necessary to ensure the proper maintenance and education of the <span class="highlight">child</span> or children is payable to the Commissioner for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">child</span> or children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>), of this section, as the case requires, vary the amount of, or cancel, weekly payments that are the subject of a determination under any preceding provision of this section, but where the widow, dependent widower or another person caring for the <span class="highlight">child</span> or children marries or dies, the weekly payments payable to each <span class="highlight">child</span> shall not be less than one-sixth of the compensation that would have been paid to the deceased employee had he survived and been totally incapacitated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where two or more employees die as the result of injury at or about the same time, and at the time of injury they were contributing towards the support of the same dependant or dependants, nothing in this Act shall be construed as preventing the Commissioner from determining that those dependants were dependent upon the earnings of each or all of the deceased employees; and (c) the amount of any <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment paid under Part VI. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will note that on the first page of the amendments relating to section 5 there are a number of definitions including the definition for <span class="highlight">child</span>, dependant and widow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this context, the term ‘dependant’ includes the spouse of the taxpayer and a <span class="highlight">child</span> (including an adopted <span class="highlight">child</span>, a step-<span class="highlight">child</span> or an ex-nuptial <span class="highlight">child</span>) of the taxpayer less than 21 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Medical expenses incurred by a taxpayer in respect of his spouse and <span class="highlight">child</span> under 21 years qualify for deduction irrespective of whether the taxpayer is entitled to a deduction for their maintenance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Subsequent rehabilitation services were to be provided by the States but the Commonwealth decided to make available, for consultation with State authorities, specialists from the Repatriation Department and from the Department of Health’s Institute  of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This was intended to provide a ‘team’ approach to the provision of the most effective assistance to these children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The principal matters dealt with by the Minister for Social Security are national social security schemes including invalid and age pensions, maternity allowances, widows pensions, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, unemployment and sickness benefits, health benefits, schemes, national superannuation, national compensation, national rehabilitation service, aged persons’ homes, assistance for sheltered workshops and handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A man supporting a wife and 2 children, drawing unemployment benefit and even after allowing for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, has been paid a benefit rate some $17 a week below the updated Melbourne University poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The standard rate of pension for aged persons, invalids and widows with children is to be increased by $1.50 a week to $21.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have just mentioned, the standard rate will also apply to widow pensioners without children in future which means that these women will receive increases of $4.25 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The age limit of 21 years for the payment of additional age, invalid or widow’s pension for full-time student children as well as the additional guardian’s or mother’s allowance, as appropriate, where the standard rate applies will be removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Payment of additional pension for full-time students together with mother’s or guardian’s allowance, if applicable, will continue without regard to the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s age until either eligibility for pension ceases or the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s study ceases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The age limit of 16 years for the payment of additional unemployment or sickness benefit in respect of a <span class="highlight">child</span> will be removed where the <span class="highlight">child</span> is engaged in full-time studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Payment will therefore be continued without regard to the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s age until either eligibility for benefit ceases or the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s studies cease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A widow with one <span class="highlight">child</span> and no property affecting will now be able to receive income of up to $86 a week before losing her entitlement to widow’s pension, or up to $90 if her <span class="highlight">child</span> is under 6 years of age or an invalid <span class="highlight">child</span> requiring fulltime care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If she has no income affecting, a widow with one <span class="highlight">child</span> may have property to the value of $38,920 or $41,000 if her <span class="highlight">child</span> is under 6 or an invalid requiring full-time care, before her entitlement to widow’s pension is extinguished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us take the case of the <span class="highlight">child</span> of 2 years which goes into hospital for a hernia but is found also to have something wrong with its colon, which is not a condition for which the cost of the extra operation can be fully recouped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to children of service pensioners, the Bill also reflects the Government’s policy that a <span class="highlight">child</span> should continue  to  be recognised for service pension purposes irrespective  of  age, for as long as the <span class="highlight">child</span> continues to undertake full-time education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill therefore embodies proposals to recognise for war pension and associated benefits a de facto wife or widow who has lived continuously with an ex-serviceman on a bona fide domestic basis for at least 3 years preceding consideration of her status, or the member’s death, as the case may be, if she is or was wholly or partly dependent on him and any ex-nuptial <span class="highlight">child</span> of an ex-serviceman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also recognises for service pension purposes a de facto wife who has lived with an ex-serviceman on a bona fide domestic basis for at least 3 years preceding consideration of her status and any ex-nuptial <span class="highlight">child</span>, foster <span class="highlight">child</span> or ward in the custody, care and control of an ex-serviceman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has also been indicated in connection with the Repatriation Bill, whilst some de facto wives and some ex-nuptial children are recognised for war pension purposes the Government considers the present provisions too restrictive and in need of being brought into line with the recognition now afforded such persons under other Commonwealth Acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill therefore includes, in clause 3, amendments which will recognise for war pension and associated benefits purposes any ex-nuptial <span class="highlight">child</span> of a seaman coming under the Acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many wage and salary, earners also receive income from other sources - rents, dividends, interest, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator represents the same element which yesteryear suggested that because it was proposed that a woman who had children should receive <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment she would sell her body to obtain <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People who have studied <span class="highlight">child</span> delinquency and related problems will confirm that I am stating the facts of life and not just products of my imagination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am certain that, for the completely different reason that it is just too easy to live without employment, we can create a similar philosophy if the current trend is carried too far and we provide for the unemployed 17-year-old a standard of living that is far above that provided for the hard-working university student or the student <span class="highlight">child</span> of a person in receipt of the unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the allowance paid to such a parent to keep his student <span class="highlight">child</span> of 16 or 17 years of age, in comparison with that paid to a person of 16 or 17 years of age who, not being a student, declares himself unemployed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it proposed to say to the invalid pensioner or to the parent receiving unemployment or sickness benefits that he will receive $21.50 for each student <span class="highlight">child</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no more classic example than the time when the economy of Great Britain, to which country most of us owe our forebears, was based to a large extent on <span class="highlight">child</span> labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed some wealthy employers led the fight to get children out of the coal mines and spinning mills of Great Britain, but they were resisted greatly by many of the parents of the children, who could not see how their families could survive without the incomes they had been used to receiving from the labours of the <span class="highlight">child</span> members of their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time children of 6 and 7 years of age worked in the mines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Anybody who doubts what I have said should read the British Hansards of the time when the first <span class="highlight">child</span> labour Bills were brought before the British Parliament and see what the different mem bers of Parliament had to say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Petitions were presented on behalf of parents of children who were working in mines and spinning mills urging the Parliament not to legislate against their standard of life, which they could not see being maintained if <span class="highlight">child</span> labour were abolished from the mines and spinning mills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suppose a couple of generations of Australians have been brought up hearing, asI did when I was a <span class="highlight">child</span>, about the British <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Should not these moneys be paid direct to a <span class="highlight">child</span> or his parents? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the spouse does that and spends money in the recovery of the <span class="highlight">child</span>, although that spouse is in the right, provided the other spouse does not come to court it is the petitioner and not the offending spouse who pays the bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The main problem with which I am confronted at the moment is getting enough time to speak to my wife about the name of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These include the recruitment of additional doctors and nurses to be concerned specifically with Aboriginal health in Western Australia, the building of a hospital complex and <span class="highlight">child</span> health clinics, a dental clinic and the provision of water supply and sewerage at various settlements in Queensland and assistance to nursing aide training and the provision of adequate sewerage at- several reserves in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Webster  related the imposition of the death penalty to the heinous crime of the murder of a head of state or the murder, or the abduction and assault of a young <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we believe in the principle of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, death should be matched by the forfeiting of another life, then I cannot see any difference between the murder of a head of state, the murder of a small <span class="highlight">child</span> or the murder of someone’s mother-in-law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the case of a dependant other than a widow, a wholly dependent widower or a dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> or grandchild, the Commissioner is also to have regard to the extent to which the dependant was dependent upon the deceased employee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By leave - I am grateful to the Senate for the opportunity of making a few brief references to this report on the survey of <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education in schools of high migrant density in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I recall that members of the Committee visited many schools of a variety of kinds in several capital cities and took note of many of the needs of <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The statement which the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate  (Senator Douglas McClelland)  has just tabled notes the role and interest of the Council’s sub-committee and the important field of research into <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Returning to my short statement on this report which  Senator Douglas  McClelland has presented, 1 would say briefly that at this time last year some 25,000 children were receiving instruction and some 600 teachers were employed under the <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wright referred to proposed new section 43 (7) which relates to a widow with a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He referred to a circumstance which could arise where, because a widow with a dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> is receiving the full amount of the average weekly earnings, the <span class="highlight">child</span> would never work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why, a <span class="highlight">child</span> could work it out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, it’s simple: Every man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia has in their bodies radioactive material from the French tests as well as other tests. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first amendment substitutes a new definition of ‘<span class="highlight">child</span>’ in section 83 to clarify the intention that a <span class="highlight">child</span> who has attained the age of 16 years must be undertaking full-time education and be wholly or substantially dependent upon the pensioner parent before being recognised for service pension purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second amendment authorises the extension of benefits under the repatriation regulations to student children over the age of 21 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parliament has given its approval in the Repatriation Act 1973 to the recognition of these children in the Repatriation Act itself and this amendment will enable the relevant provisions of the repatriation regulations to be extended to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Replacement fertility, the level of reproduction con sistent with ultimate zero population growth, under contemporary conditions of mortality in the United States of America averages out to 2.11 children per woman over a life time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-79-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The figure allows for deaths among women before they reach <span class="highlight">child</span>-bearing age, and also for the fact that slightly more males than females are born. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-79-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commission of Population Growth and the American Future in its report on 27th March to the  President  and Congress of the United States commented ‘Even if immigration from abroad ceased and couples had only 2 children on the average - just enough to replace themselves - our population would continue to grow for about 70 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-79-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our past rapid growth has given us so many young couples that, to bring population growth to an immediate halt, the birth rate would have to drop by almost50 per cent and today’s generation of parents would have to limit themselves to an average of about one <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-79-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fact of life is that every man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> in this community has radioactive material in his or her body as a result of the tests, including the French tests in the pacific, and this is causing more and more disquiet as more is learned about these problems by international scientists in the biological field and especially the genetic field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me put the position: We have before us a measure whereby if a person lived in Australia as a <span class="highlight">child</span> but has moved to some other country and sees what is being provided by this Labor Government and comes to Australia for a holiday for 12 months, he can receive for the rest of his life the maximum amount of this pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Two dear little children left for school happily in the morning and a person or persons unknown took those innocent little children away and committed the most vile of crimes and buried their dear little bodies in the sand in a creek miles away from their own home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Life imprisonment today means a penalty of 7, 8 or 9 years in a prison that is supported by the taxpayers - a prison which would be supported by the mother and the father of those 2 dear little children whom I have just mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only two or three weeks ago in my own home town, in the street in which I live, some person or persons unknown sneaked into a flat occupied by a husband and wife and 2 little children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During that night, in the darkness, while everybody was asleep, some person or persons unknown sneaked into that flat and took away an 18- months-old <span class="highlight">child</span> - a dear sweet little <span class="highlight">child</span> whom I had seen in my time toddling around its home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That <span class="highlight">child</span> was taken from its bed, molested, sexually assaulted, murdered and thrown onto the roof of a building only 400 yards away from her parents’ home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That if, as some argue, the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> at the time abortions are performed does not constitute human life, then justice and reason demand that anyone arguing thus has the onus of proof upon him and that this onus has not been discharged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are some consequential changes of substance, in that the consent of the father of a <span class="highlight">child</span> who is not married to the mother will now be required in certain circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>removing the legislative distinction between legitimate and illegitimate children, the new table will, I believe, provide a set of conditions that will be more consonant with present day requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think I should explain some of the conditions under which the Commonwealth senior secondary scholarship scheme and the isolated children’s scheme operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where a holder of a senior secondary scholarship is also eligible for assistance under the Australian Government’s isolated children’s scheme, his entitlement to senior secondary benefits is limited to the payment of the basic annual grant of $150. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the same student may receive up to the maximum assistance of $1,004 per annum under the isolated children’s scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that a senior secondary scholar who is an isolated <span class="highlight">child</span> will receive a minimum of $500 per annum from the Australian Government.In that respect a minimum allowance of $500 is payable by the Australian Government to every senior secondary scholar who is considered to be an isolated <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second, and a deeply disturbing one, is that removing the requirement of parental consent would have the effect of undermining parental authority still further; and even of encouraging bad parents to wash their hands of their children at the first signs of teenage trouble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Good parents do nol cease to be such when the sun rises on a 21st birthday; indeed their continuing care and concern is confidently gambled upon by the government when it requires a financial contribution to a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s further and further education even up to the age of 25. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The purpose is to remove as far as possible the distinction between children born in wedlock and children born out of wedlock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There will be some consequential changes in the law in that the consent of the father of a <span class="highlight">child</span> who is not married to the mother will be required in certain circumstances where he is living with the mother or where the minor is living with him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In certain circumstances the father of an illegitimate <span class="highlight">child</span> would have just as much interest in this situation as the mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that not one honourable senator, if his <span class="highlight">child</span> was suffering from asthma, would deny that his doctor was the one who should prescribe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would have to obtain a special authority if I were to treat the <span class="highlight">child</span> of an honourable senator with that drug. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I may have been treating that <span class="highlight">child</span> for years, not the Commonwealth Department of Health doctor in Sydney, Hobart or wherever he may live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am the doctor who has treated the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On one occasion I had in my own home attending my own <span class="highlight">child</span> a locum who took the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s temperature and then went into the lounge room and opened up a medical text book to find out what was wrong with the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The classes of women to whom the new benefit will be payable under this Bill are (a) unmarried mothers, including deserted de facto wives and de facto wives of prisoners’, (b) married women not living with their husbands (deserting wives) or wives who have been separated for various other reasons, provided that the women be living with, and have the custody, care and control of a <span class="highlight">child</span> or children of whom she is the mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These women are those who are not at present eligible for a widow’s pension under the Social Services Act and who, with their children, have been subject to discrimination in the level of assistance available to them in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new benefit will become payable 6 months after the date of the event which gives rise to eligibility - for example, the birth of a <span class="highlight">child</span> or separation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Returning now to the Bill, the rate of supporting mother’s benefit will be the same as the rate of Class A widow’s pensions, including mother’s allowance, additional pension for children and, where applicable, supplementary assistance for those mothers who are paying rent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that these rates in weekly amounts are: Pensions $21.50; mother’s allowance $4, or $6 if the <span class="highlight">child</span> is under 6 or an invalid; additional pension $4.50 for each <span class="highlight">child</span>; and supplementary assistance $4. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The means test and other conditions for payment will be broadly the same as those applying to Class A widow pensioners; for example, the residence qualifications will be the same and it will also be a responsibility of the supporting mother to seek maintenance from the father of the <span class="highlight">child</span> if, in the circumstances of her case, it would be reasonable to expect her to do this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that in Tasmania a deserted de facto wife of 12 months standing may sue for maintenance for herself and children, but in the other States she may claim maintenance for children only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A word about children: The Government believes that when a mother gives birth to a <span class="highlight">child</span> she should not be discriminated against merely because conception may have occurred after she became a widow or after she became separated from her husband. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In future, both for widow’s pensions purposes and for supporting mother’s benefit, a widow’s own <span class="highlight">child</span> or a supporting mother’s own <span class="highlight">child</span> will qualify them for the respective pension or benefit, irrespective of whether their <span class="highlight">child</span> was conceived before or after tha date of widowhood, desertion or separation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill therefore amends the old definition of ‘<span class="highlight">child</span>’ which has remained in the legislation since 1942 and introduces a new definition, which defines a ‘<span class="highlight">child</span>’ as any <span class="highlight">child</span> born of the mother or a <span class="highlight">child</span> of whom she had the care prior to the date on which she became a widow or a supporting mother including a <span class="highlight">child</span> who was an adopted <span class="highlight">child</span> at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further advance made by the Bill is that the additional pension of $4.50 a week for children will be payable for all other children in the care, of the widow or supporting mother, whether those other children are qualifying children or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A deduction of $6 a week for each dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> will continue to be made from the widow’s income and will also be made from the supporting mother’s income before the means test is applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, in effect, gives a Class A widow or supporting mother with one <span class="highlight">child</span> a permissible income, of $26 a week plus a further  )’$6  for each other <span class="highlight">child</span> dependent on her. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">child</span> will also be accepted as being in the custody, care and control of a widow or supporting mother where that <span class="highlight">child</span> is not living with the widow - for example, where it is living away from home to attend school, provided the widow is making a reasonable contribution towards the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s maintenance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No less than 85 per cent of the family homes to be built by State housing authorities with our advances will be allocated to families in which the average gross weekly income of the main breadwinner (exclusive of any overtime and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments) does not exceed 85 per cent of average weekly earnings per employed male unit as denned in the Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where the family includes more than two children, this will be increased by $2 per week for each <span class="highlight">child</span> after the second. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In line with our policy of ensuring that our housing advances for welfare purposes benefit the more needy, applicants eligible to receive home builders’ account advances will include a married or engaged couple and a single parent or guardian with one or more children, where the average gross weekly income of the main breadwinner, inclusive of overtime but excluding <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments, does not exceed  95  per cent of average weekly earnings, plus  $2  a week for each <span class="highlight">child</span> beyond the second. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also makes provision for an officer or employee who is the father or a person accepting responsibility for the care and maintenance of the <span class="highlight">child</span> to take up to 1 week’s leave, with pay, around the time of the birth of a <span class="highlight">child</span> where he requires the leave to take care of the mother of a <span class="highlight">child</span> or of a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, therefore, is introducing the new benefits and leave entitlements in respect of its own officers and employees, to enable each person concerned to fulfil the role of mother and if she wishes, to continue her career after the birth of her <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision in this Bill for up to 1 week’s leave for the father or other responsible person should help that person to meet the increased domestic responsibilities that arise at the time of the birth of a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As is pointed out in the Committee’s report, under the proposed legislation we could have the situation, for example, where the death of a public servant, a Commonwealth employee, who is in receipt, in round figures, of $30,000 of income a year, and who leaves a <span class="highlight">child</span>, could result in the payment in all - for instance, if it were over a period of 20 years - of a sum of $316,500. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been gravely concerned for many years in trying to assist young people who, in the early stages of marriage with perhaps one or two children, are forced to live with in-laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps some of the couples have married close to the birth of their first <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The weekly payments would probably be apportioned on the basis of a payment of 75 per cent of the total benefit to the widow and 25 per cent of that benefit to a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The weekly payment in that case to a widow would be $287.54 and to the <span class="highlight">child</span> $95.80. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The lump sum payable at present for a <span class="highlight">child</span> in that circumstance would be in addition to the amount that I have just mentioned and would depend upon a number of factors such as the age of the <span class="highlight">child</span> and the age at which under the provisions of the legislation the <span class="highlight">child</span> would cease to be a dependant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the example I have given, the repatriation pension would be $21.50, the domestic allowance would be $8.50 and the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance would be $1.38 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">child</span> of a public servant in Canberra who is on a salary of $30,000 a year receives $30,000 a year for the rest of her life if he is killed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The wife with one <span class="highlight">child</span> of a public servant on a salary of $20,000 a year receives $20,000 a year, terminable only if she remarries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The widow’s benefit is $15,000 a year if she has no <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Commonwealth public servant’s widow has one <span class="highlight">child</span> to keep she will get not merely three-quarters of his salary - $15,000 - but the full $20,000- and that will not be reduced when the <span class="highlight">child</span> dies or becomes selfdependent, nor will it be reduced while she shows dependency on her husband. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of an employee of private industry or the State Public Service, the most that his widow with one <span class="highlight">child</span> can receive is one payment of $15,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remaining proposals in the Bill are a result of the introduction by the Commonwealth of schemes to assist with the education of children living in isolated areas and for the payment of a domiciliary nursing care benefit to persons taking care of invalid aged relations in their homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments proposed in relation to the isolated children’s education scheme will ensure that allowances paid under the scheme will receive the same exemption from income tax as payments under the Commonwealth secondary and technical scholarship schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like the scholarship schemes, however, amounts payable for the maintenance or accommodation of isolated children are to be taken into account for the purposes of the concessional deductions for maintenance of dependants while allowances paid in respect of education costs are to be taken into account in calculating the concessional deduction for a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s education expenses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make a comparison between compensation benefits provided under this Bill and the existing repatriation benefits for a totally and permanently incapacitated person, with a wife and one <span class="highlight">child</span>, whose average weekly earnings are $ 1 30 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of repatriation benefits such a person would receive $56.53, calculated as follows: Repatriation pension, $51.10; wife’s allowance, S4.05; and allowance for one <span class="highlight">child</span>, SI. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second comparison concerns the widow of a person earning  $130  a week, with a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A widow in a similar position receiving repatriation benefits would receive a benefit of  $37.35,  calculated as follows: War widow’s pension,  $21.50;  domestic allowance,  $8.50;  and allowance for one <span class="highlight">child</span>,  $7.35. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But one should mention very clearly that local government is and has been the <span class="highlight">child</span> of the States and they are charged legislatively to care for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The arrangement for leave would be that 6 weeks leave could be taken before the expected date of confinement and 6 weeks leave taken after the birth of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are other provisions within the Bill which allow a Government employee to take other leave, sometimes from accumulated leave or from accumulated sick leave up to 52 weeks at the time of the birth of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Should it be society as a whole or should it be the industry where the women are employed or should it be part of the whole social service pattern so that some maternity benefit is paid to all women who have a maternity condition and who have the responsibility of the expenses of confinement and other matters related to the birth of the <span class="highlight">child</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Above all, we need accelerated action by Government in the provision of adequate <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities for those children of working mothers who are part of the mainstream of our employment pattern at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have all sorts of statistics to show us how many more of these women are married and who have children of pre-school age, yet it has been some years since the first Gorton proposal, that the Government would create <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities for the children of working mothers was announced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that steps have been taken in this concept but I am a little concerned that they have not been taken as rapidly as the social pattern of Australia would show, because hundreds of thousands of pre-school children of working mothers are at present without adequate or ideal <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendment which I shall present is one which sets out to provide that unmarried male and female contributors to the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund would have some entitlements to pass on in succession to a surviving mother, brother, sister or <span class="highlight">child</span>, particularly if dependent, in the same way as can a married man in the Services in relation to his surviving widow and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe that every parent and every <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia has the right - it is contained in the Declaration of Human Rights - to be educated according to that religious system to which they adhere or in which they believe, if they so choose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise that this was after we, then in Government, had announced on 1 1 May the increases which apply this year, the scheme which we introduced whereby every nongovernment school would receive from Federal sources 20 per cent of the average cost of the education of a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a government school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 simply reassert that justice requires the recognition of the right of every <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia to a basic percentage of education expenditure from government funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, let  me  take his suggestion that there has been a denial by the Government of the right of every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> to receive economic support for its educational needs from government funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So much for  Senator Rae’s  allegation that there is a denial by the Government of the right of every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> to receive economic support for his educational needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will take a long time before that great imbalance is corrected but at last we have started on the road towards giving every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> at least equality of opportunity so far as educational circumstances are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The denial of the Government of the right of every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> to receive economic support for his educational needs from Government funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose the essential part of this rather long motion moved by  Senator Rae  is contained in paragraph 1 which refers to the denial by the Government of the right of every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> to receive economic support from government funds for his educational needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one says nothing else, 1 think one must say that one has to admire the audacity of a defunct, defeated Liberal Party which, on seeing the first Labor Budget for 23 years which gives unprecedented assistance to the education of Australian children, with an increase- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have provided for a 92 per cent increase in the budgetary expenditure on education in this country and the Opposition has the audacity to say that this Government is denying every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> the right to receive economic support for his educational needs from Government funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have increased by 92 per cent the money available for the education of young Australian children, and one can only admire the Goebbels technique of this motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a time when such a tremendous increase in expenditure on education is proposed by the Federal Labor Government the Liberal Party can only say that we are denying the rights of Australian children to an education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are denying the rights of Australian children to an education, what was the previous defeated Government doing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government holusbolus gave per capita grants to schools, taking no account whatsoever of the financial resources of the parents whose children were receiving that assistance and taking no account whatsoever to the financial resources of the schools receiving that assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I may be forgiven for injecting a note of class warfare into the proceedings of the Senate I, along, I believe, with the overwhelming majority of Australian people, believe that it is totally improper, totally unjust, something to be condemned and something to be deplored that when a wealthy Melbourne stockbroker wants to send his son to Geelong Grammar School he should receive precisely the same assistance as a widow at Paynes Find, Western Australia, who wants to send her <span class="highlight">child</span> to a state high school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would make extra grants to schools which averaged fees less than $300 a year over the past 5 years, providing $75 above the $68 grant already made to each secondary school <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate is debating  a  matter of urgency proposed for discussion by  Senator Rae,  chiding the Government for denying the right of every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> to receive economic support for his education needs from Government funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In deciding that after 1973 there will be no further grants for recurrent, as against capital, expenses in schools in category A, the Government is not, as  Senator Rae  suggested, denying the right of every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> to receive economic support for his educational needs from Government funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those children will continue to receive support from the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The latest statistics show that just under 10 per cent of all taxpayers claim 200 or more per <span class="highlight">child</span> for education expenses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The overwhelming majority of those taxpayers receiving the benefit would be parents of children attending category A schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of his electioneering, the present Minister for Education said that his policy was that the Commonwealth should have identity with the education of every <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He proposes now to prevent the Commonwealth having identity with the children in 105 schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam’s attention was drawn in my presence to the example of a man who sends his <span class="highlight">child</span> to Melbourne Boys High School and another man in receipt of the same income who sends his <span class="highlight">child</span> to Melbourne Grammer School. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Rae  said that there is to be a denial by the Government of the right of every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> to receive economic support for its educational needs from Government funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The denial by the Government of the right of every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> to receive economic support for his educational needs from Government funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today parents of children at schools all over the country are angry at what I would call the blatant injustice of this withdrawal of aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any government which proceeds to deny the right of every <span class="highlight">child</span> in this country to some economic support in its education cannot be relied upon not only now but in the future when it makes any decision or announcement concerning this matter or indeed any other matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So this denial to provide funds for every <span class="highlight">child</span> by withdrawing aid from some schools is having a crippling effect on the Australian community and, in particular, on the education system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Conference condemns the denial of the fundamental right of every <span class="highlight">child</span> to a basic share of  public  money by the withdrawal of the existing contribution to recurrent expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly it refers to the denial by the Government of the right of every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> to receive economic support for his educational needs from Government funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here for the first time we have a document designed not to be vote-catching, not to be a gimmicky thing that sets out to win some votes and some cheap political advantage but a document based on the needs of a great country frying to fulfill the educational requirements of every <span class="highlight">child</span> in the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Must we sit here and deny to so many thousands of Australian children an equal right to the availability of educational facilities in this land? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ought we not to be engaged upon an exercise designed to raise the level of all sections of the education system in this country in order to give every <span class="highlight">child</span> an equal opportunity? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have said for years and years: ‘Give us the opportunity to do something for all the people in this country - not the silvertails, not the privileged few at the top of the list but for every man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> in the Australian community’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first and basic thing that one would do - it is in the interests of the country to do it too - is to provide education to the highest level possible within the intellectual capacity of every <span class="highlight">child</span> in the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we ought to stick our necks out when it involves giving to every <span class="highlight">child</span> in the Australian community an equal opportunity for education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, too, is one of the arguments that turns me against those who argue for the abolition of the death penalty but who argue in favour of the right of the mother - because she is a mother and who may feel she may be inconvenienced even by a pregnancy - to take the life of her own <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">child</span> is not judged by a jury, society or anyone else; it is judged by the mother in a fit of desperation or merely in a fit of consideration solely of her convenience and circumstances in life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill amends the Commonwealth Teaching Service Act in 5 ways: It makes provision for special superannuation arrangements for New South Wales and South Australian teachers now teaching in Commonwealth schools; it provides benefits by way of book and equipment allowance to Commonwealth teaching service scholars; it provides benefits by way of special financial assistance for Commonwealth teaching service scholars; it repeals existing provisions for officers absent from duty in relation to <span class="highlight">child</span> birth; and it enables the Commissioner to provide, and the authorities to use, members of the Commonwealth Teaching Service for special educational duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Teaching Service carries responsibility for the education of a significant proportion of the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">child</span> population of Australia, some of these children being taught in their own languages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must work to give equality of opportunity to all children in the Northern Territory - children who live under some factors of disadvantage in their schooling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s denial that every <span class="highlight">child</span> had a right to have part of its educational needs paid for by Government funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I willnot quote from the actual motion but it was in these terms: We believe that every <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia has a right to government expenditure on its behalf towards its education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My view was that every school in the country, including Geelong Grammar School, should receive a basic grant from the Commonwealth and that the Commonwealth should have an identity with the education of every <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Beazley  who was prepared to stomp around the countryside last year following his leader,  Mr Whitlam,  and promising faithfully left, right and centre, as was quoted repeatedly last night from occasion after occasion, that no independent school in this country would be worse off under a Labor Government, is prepared to say sanctimoniously on 30 May when he introduced the Karmel Committee recommendations that although he still believes that every school and every <span class="highlight">child</span> should have something, he is bound by the recommendations of the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to refer to the effect that this will have on children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will respond to it in this way: The position is that under the scheme which was introduced by the LiberalCountry Party Coalition Government last year there was to be a graduated acrosstheboard per capita grant made available to every <span class="highlight">child</span> in a non-government school in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those per capita grants were to  be  calculated as a percentage of the average cost of educating a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a government school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They increased in government schools and so too did the grants increase to children attending non-government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cut out aid to little schools such as the ones I referred to last night that cannot afford to be toyed with at the whim of some socialist who decides that he wants vindictively to take it out because of some idea that wealthy schools should be discriminated against without ever thinking that at whatever school it may be there are children who may come from a variety of economic backgrounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So .many parents have written to me in the past few weeks saying that both parents have been working, gaining a relatively low income, but they have been prepared to work to put their <span class="highlight">child</span> through a school at which an education of the type they believe in is available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Your petitioners believe in the principle that every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span>, irrespective of the school he attends, is entitled to economic support for his basic educational needs from the funds placed at the disposal of the Australian government through taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-0-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, they believe that this economic support should be in the form of per capita grants which are directly related to the cost of educating an Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> in a government school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-0-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your Petitioners therefore humble pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should acknowledge the right of every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> to equal per capita grants of government money spent on education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-0-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: What do we make of a government which some weeks before the Budget says that it will- this is the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  speaking- increase <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that he would increase <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and include it in his Budget, not months but weeks before the Budget, at a time when it was being formulated, when it was in the hearts and minds and within the knowledge of the Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By distributing $843m we are removing the impossibility of the less privileged <span class="highlight">child</span> in our community to receive the same education as children who went to category A schools and to higher schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only will tertiary education be free to those children who can receive it but also they will, subject to a means test, be granted a living allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will assist the <span class="highlight">child</span> who had to terminate his education at the tertiary level because of the inability of his parents to keep him at school because of his inability to exist on the pocket money which the parents could afford. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children will now receive a living allowance for the purpose of attending school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will give a right to the children of the lower marginal worker to attend school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also $304 per annum will be given to low income families to educate children in the last 2 years of secondary school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They say that they love the family man and his children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has not been an increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That prompts me to ask: What has happened to the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres program which was envisaged? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> care centres are undoubtedly essential if there is to be greater female participation in the workforce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are essential at this stage for the participation which is already involved and the numbers of pre-school age children and young school age children whose mothers are working mothers and who need the assistance of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres to combine their domestic and family reponsibilities with that of their employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The grief that this policy has caused the Aboriginal parents is only equalled by the grief of the foster parents who have been called upon later to surrender a <span class="highlight">child</span> they have reared as their own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The effect of this policy on the <span class="highlight">child</span> can only be guessed but there are outstanding examples of young Aboriginal men and women in our society who have overcome this trauma without loss of their cultural identity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Your petitioners believe in the principle that every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span>, irrespective of the school he attends, is entitled to economic support for his basic educational needs from the funds placed at the disposal of the Australian government through taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Further, they believe that this economic support should be in the form of per capita grants which are directly related to the cost of educating an Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> in a government school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill provides legislative basis for the provision, as an emergency measure under the <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education program, of supplementary class-room accommodation in state and independent schools where this is necessary to allow adequate special instruction of migrant children to take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill,  Mr President,  seeks an amendment of the Immigration (Education) Act 1971 which, in defining in section 3 capital equipment of an educational nature’ which could be financed under the <span class="highlight">child</span> program, specifically excluded any building. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The program of special assistance to state and independent schools in which there are migrant children handicapped by a lack of knowledge of the English language was introduced by the previous Government in April 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision was then taken that funds should be provided for the salaries of special teachers to provide special instruction to migrant children; for the purchase of approved capital equipment of the language laboratory type for use in the special classes to be established; for the provision of suitable teaching and learning materials; and for the cost of training courses for special teachers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite these difficulties, there has been a substantial development in the <span class="highlight">child</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless children and teachers are working in some schools, particularly of high migrant density, under completely unacceptable conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A survey of <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education in schools of high migrant density in Melbourne which the Government initiated late in 1972, and undertaken by the Victorian Education Department, the Catholic Education Office in Victoria, the Department of Immigration and the Department of Education, revealed serious inadequacies with respect both to accommodation and supply of teachers, which are related problems, and some shortages of equipment and materials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Cabinet on 14 May 1973 approved a joint submission by the Minister for Immigration and the Minister for Education  (Mr Beazley)  to extend the <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education program to include provision for supplementary class-room accommodation by way of demountable or portable class-rooms, where this was necessary as an emergency measure to ensure that adequate instruction could be given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the problems which was identified as a result of a number of inquiries set up by the Opposition while in government was the need for a greater degree of English teaching of migrant children to enable them to participate fully in the education otherwise available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surveys were conducted, in New South Wales in particular, in relation to the education of migrant children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following those surveys, steps were taken in 1970 by the former Liberal-Country Party Government to introduce a program which provided for the expenditure of money in relation to migrant <span class="highlight">child</span> education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The survey revealed very serious inadequacies in relation to the accommodation available for the special teaching of the English language to migrant children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Over a period of years assistance has been extended and now such a <span class="highlight">child</span> is able to obtain 2 free hearing aids from the appropriate department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Just to show honourable senators what happens, if I remember rightly it was in this city of Canberra, or somewhere not very far away, that a young <span class="highlight">child</span> was fooling around with paints on a canvas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went on to say that a <span class="highlight">child</span> was shickered too and he painted the picture, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If my memory serves me correctly when we arrived we were met by the then manager of the reservation who was seeing his wife and <span class="highlight">child</span> off for Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government wants to give equal opportunity in schooling to every <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia, it should concentrate on the primary field because it is there that the <span class="highlight">child</span> takes his first steps up the education ladder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a well known statistical fact that 20 per cent of all primary school children have some specific learning defect, whether it is an inability to leant to read or an inability to do sums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is quite clear that those 3 powerful groups in New South Wales would all support the right to have included in the consideration of education in Australia that parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that should be given to their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe it is important to have as one of the matters to which the Commission should have regard the right available to every parent and every <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia not to be directed as to the form of education which they are to receive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is under an obligation, in my view, to see that every <span class="highlight">child</span> in this country receives a fair go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason I prefer what  Senator Rae  supports which is, in effect, that we regard all the children of this country as having equal rights and we give each of them justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some members of the Labor Party have assured me that they believe in equal justice for all our children and that the only difference is, perhaps, in the ways in which the justice shall be dispensed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Labor Party is going back to 1957- in the days when it did not agree with justice for independent schools- when it states in this clause, in effect, that it will divide the children of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I attended a lot of meetings and I heard him say that he was for justice for all the children of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The gallup polls show that the people believe that all the children should be given an equal chance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My final point is that the United Nations Charter of Human Rights states, as  Senator Rae  has pointed out, that the parent has the right to decide the school his <span class="highlight">child</span> will attend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Labor Party has made a grave mistake in once again putting forward this proposition that some children in the community have prior rights to others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, when we talk about that particular measure, as well as subclause (a) of this amendment, we open up this matter of the prior right to choose the kind of education that any parent wants to give his <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party is determined that every <span class="highlight">child</span> who embarks on secondary education in 1973 shall, irrespective of school or location, have as good an opportunity as any other <span class="highlight">child</span> of completing his secondary education and continuing his education further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Specifically the Opposition sets out to deny the primary obligation of governments to provide government schools of high standard which are open without fees or religious tests to all children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, of course, a plank of the Labor Party policy that there is a primary obligation on governments to provide and maintain government school systems of the highest standards open to all children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not deny that there should be an opportunity, as there is, for parents to nominate the school to which their <span class="highlight">child</span> will go but surely no one can object to the basic cardinal principle that there is an obligation to ensure that an educational system is maintained at the highest level in schools of the highest standard, open without fee and without religious test to all children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was made clear that not every <span class="highlight">child</span> who goes to a government school has parents who are poor or in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any <span class="highlight">child</span> who goes to those schools will get an education equal to anything which can be obtained in the top class independent schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One sends his <span class="highlight">child</span> to the top class government school, and one sends his <span class="highlight">child</span> to the top class independent school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should the parent who sends his <span class="highlight">child</span> to the top class independent school have to pay hugh fees, and the parent who is in the same wage bracket but who sends his <span class="highlight">child</span> to the top class government school not have to pay fees?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs aware of a report that appeared in yesterday’s Canberra ‘Advertiser’ concerning the case of  Mr and Mrs Bob  King and their foster <span class="highlight">child</span> Kelly? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts of the case are that the New South Wales adoption authorities were not aware that the Kings wished to adopt this <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When people wish to adopt a <span class="highlight">child</span> in the Australian Capital Territory it is usual for them to make inquiries of the Australian Capital Territory authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unlikely that the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s mother ever approved of the Kings, as they are unknown to her. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I took the matter up with my departmental head,  Mr Dexter,  who agreed with me that it would be better to write to the New South Wales Department of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Kings would then be accepted as adoptive parents but would not of necessity have the <span class="highlight">child</span> adopted out to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would go on a list and the matter would be decided in accordance with the welfare of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For our part the Democratic Labor Party has attempted for years to have substantial increases made in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is obviously one of the ways in which the needs of young families, and particularly the needs of young children, can at least be provided for in part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We virtually have not succeeded at all in our campaign- certainly in no large measure- in persuading either the previous government or this Government of the need for an adequate provision for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment in the case of families which have more than a certain number of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It says with quite a degree of balance that one cannot give an undue accent to the disregard of the position of the aged any more than one can give an undue accent to the disregard of the position of the younger families and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If public submissions are sought from interested bodies, I would indicate at this stage that if the Democratic Labor Party is invited to make a submission and if it is appropriate to do it or if in response to a request we are permitted to do so, we will make a submission to this body on the need for adequate <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment as one of the most practical, one of the easiest and one of the most justifiable ways of assisting young families in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last thing I wish to say is that noting that under section 8 the benefit of the scholarship may be a basic allowance or a living allowance, I applaud what the Government has done regarding living allowances for isolated children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I only hope that because of the disadvantage which the <span class="highlight">child</span> of school or university age is suffering by reason of the high cost of transport and living in the cities and the high cost of educational fees and other things in the cities, emphasis will be given on a basis proportionate to the hardship of those costs upon country children in providing the living allowances so that the injustice that is imposed upon children- a barrier to country children against their getting an equal opportunity with those living in the cities- can be bridged as much as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Assistance under the Tertiary Allowances Scheme may include living allowance, incidentals allowance, allowances for a dependent spouse and or <span class="highlight">child</span>, travelling allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that what  Senator McManus  has put is really related only to the simple fact that a person wants to send his or her <span class="highlight">child</span> to a university merely because  Mrs Jones  or  Mrs Smith  down the road is sending her children to a university. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To include in its consideration of welfare manpower needs, Social Workers, Psychologists, Sociologists and other professional disciplines involves in the area of Social Policy, as well as all job-oriented personnel, such as welfare officers, case aides, <span class="highlight">child</span> care officers and voluntary workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Industries Assistance Commission Bill is the <span class="highlight">child</span> of the present Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great proportion of the $8,448 paid in tax by a taxpayer on this high income would be spent on the education of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That man will be paying completely for his <span class="highlight">child</span>’s education if he sends his <span class="highlight">child</span> to an expensive private school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the very sad and unsatisfactory circumstances surrounding the frustration of the desire of  Mr and Mrs Bob  King of Rivett to adopt their partAboriginal foster <span class="highlight">child</span> Kelly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the happiness of the <span class="highlight">child</span>, the foster parents and the mother should be paramount in this matter and achievable if red tape can be cut, I ask the Minister whether he has made any progress in his efforts to facilitate the adoption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been pointed out to the Kings, there is always the risk in relation to an application for adoption that the court will not give the <span class="highlight">child</span> to the adoptive parents chosen by the mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear from a recent newspaper article that the arrangement was not so much that  Mrs King  apply for adoption but rather that she obtain the consent of the mother to allow the <span class="highlight">child</span> to remain with her. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principal aims of the Government in the area of special education for the handicapped are as follows: First, the development of each handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> to the fullness of his potential as an effective, integrated, self-respecting and independent person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Third, the condition the <span class="highlight">child</span> must surmount is not the only objective of remedial action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The focus should be on the <span class="highlight">child</span> as a total person, living in a. family and a community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourth, we need a comprehensive screening .system for the early indentification of handicaps- in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, in pre-school, in primary school and in secondary school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To implement the report of the Interim Committee for the Schools Commission on the subject of handicapped children we must develop a system of administration which actually expresses compassion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to detect need in children we must face the fact that families most at risk are least likely to go voluntarily to infant welfare clinics, least likely to use <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, least likely to have the services of competent medical practitioners, social workers or psychological advisers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Research is needed to identify what characteristics of children are most predictive of subsequent education and social difficulty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We just do not have enough trained people capable of physical, intellectual, emotional and social assessment of any <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(This is in the context that a family consisting of a man, wife and one <span class="highlight">child</span> and earning the minimum wage (currently $60.10 a week) should not be liable to pay the levy; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-61-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party is determined that every <span class="highlight">child</span> who embarks on secondary education in 1973 shall, irrespective of school or location, have as good an opportunity as any other <span class="highlight">child</span> of completing his secondary education and continuing his education further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage, in referring to the legislative background, I make the point that for some years there has been provision for basic per capita grants to be made by the Commonwealth in respect of each <span class="highlight">child</span> at a non-government school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is so notwithstanding the fact that this Government has introduced that policy this year, that it has taken steps to abolish the means test, that it still pays <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment- I might add, originally introduced by the present Oppositionupon a basis which means that every <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia, irrespective of the means of the parent, is entitled to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is so notwithstanding an acceptance of the view throughout this community that in these respects there are certain rights which go with children, not with schools, not with their parents and not with some other relationship which may be attributable to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We suggest that the <span class="highlight">child</span> himself has a right to the basic grant from the public purse towards the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s education so that his parents may on his behalf or later in his development exercise a right to attend whatever school he chooses and to receive the form of education he wishes to receive or which his parents wish him to receive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pause to remind the Government that at the time of that statement there was a provision for a basic per capita grant to be paid to every <span class="highlight">child</span> at a non-systemic school in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that subsequently legislation was introduced which improved the system under which that money was paid does not take away from the fact that on the date of that promise a basic per capita grant was available to every <span class="highlight">child</span> who wished to attend a non-systemic school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is up to the Government to honour the promises and to see that there is justice for every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> and every Australian parent who wish to avail themselves of their right to choose the kind of education which the children are to receive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My view was that every school in the country, including the Geelong Grammar School, should receive a basic grant from the Commonwealth and that the Commonwealth should have an identity with the education of every <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happens with regard to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Headmaster,  Mr Breakspear,  says: The only reason that I can give for the Government’s refusing us aid is that it imagines that every Jewish <span class="highlight">child</span> has millionaire parents’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, according to the Government’s propagandists, who seem to have had such a wonderful run, all these schools are wealthy, and every <span class="highlight">child</span> comes to school in a Rolls Royce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that we should talk about giving money to children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we ought to do is to allocate money to children and the parents of those children can choose the school to which they will go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those people would be suited down to the ground if they could prove that a subvention was being given to a religion through a school instead of a <span class="highlight">child</span> receiving an education grant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one can cavil at the principle of money being given to children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a teacher for 19.5 years I was always under the impression that all Austraiian children were entitled to equal rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some instances a <span class="highlight">child</span> is kept at one of these schools because the parents out of a feeling of sacrifice feel that the <span class="highlight">child</span> should be there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Do honourable senators realise that a considerable number of children who attend one of the socalled wealthy schools in Melbourne get there on scholarships and would not be able to attend this school otherwise? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no needs system for people attending universities or receiving pension payments or <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some parents who have children attending what they regard as deprived schoolssome of these are religious schools- have said to me: ‘Look, we are going to get more money; you ought to vote for this ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the aid enables the school that your <span class="highlight">child</span> attends to be improved, at a certain point under the Government system aid will be cut off’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we want the retention of the principle that every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> is entitled to assistance from the funds provided by Australian taxpayers, regardless of which school a parent selects for the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must continue to register my disapproval of the philosophy that allows a rich parent’s <span class="highlight">child</span> to receive maximum benefit by attending a particular school and a not-so-rich parent’s <span class="highlight">child</span> to receive less or none at another school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is a perversion of justice in a system that is supposed to believe in equality of opportunity for all children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government excludes certain schools and it knows perfectly well that the policy of the Opposition, stated last year when it was in government, and stated this year over and over again has been to establish a system of funding so that every <span class="highlight">child</span> in the country receives a grant towards his education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators very well know, the long-established policy of our Party, both in Government and Opposition, has been that every <span class="highlight">child</span> attending a non-government school should receive a basic per pupil grant towards the recurrent cost of his or her education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The serious aspect of this Bill is the Government’s failure to keep its electoral promises so that every <span class="highlight">child</span> in the country may receive a per capita grant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of the promises given by  Mr Whitlam  and his cronies for the purpose of capturing votes in order to gain office and receiving a report such as this which divorces the real benefits of our system from a significant section of the non-government school students, this Party would deserve to earn discredit if it did not fight to establish the principle that every <span class="highlight">child</span> in this country is entitled to receive 100 per cent of the cost of his state school education if he wants it- and I took it- or, if he goes to an independent school, that he is entitled to such proportion of that expenditure as the Federal Government of the day decides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this should be applied uniformly, without fear, favour or discrimination, to every <span class="highlight">child</span> whose parents partly support him at a non-government school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We most urgently ask the Australian Government to achieve this reconciliation by including in its program effective assistance to every <span class="highlight">child</span> in the form of a basic recurrent grant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One school in the suburbs of Melbourne has 53 migrant students, many of whose parents are both working to keep the <span class="highlight">child</span> at this school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We particularly regret that the principle of a basic recurrent grant to every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> has been abandoned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We support the overall right of all citizens to a freedom of choice in education, a right that the State should recognise in an effective way by giving all citizens, all children, some access to public funds for education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first basis, of course, is that the amendment gives expression to a basic principle that where aid is provided to non-government school children that aid should be on a per capita basis and be available as a matter of principle to every <span class="highlight">child</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My view was that every school in this country, including Geelong Grammar School, should receive a basic grant from the Commonwealth, and that the Commonwealth should have an identity with the education of every <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We of the Opposition accepted the principle in 1972 that we should work out the estimated average cost of educating a <span class="highlight">child</span> at a government school and determine the proportion of that estimated average cost which would be provided for every student at a non-government school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time, the Treasurer also announced that the handicapped children’s benefit would be doubled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This benefit is payable to the proprietor of an approved handicapped persons home for each day on which the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> receives handicapped person care in that home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Every school <span class="highlight">child</span> knows that there is world-wide inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the deceased had been on a salary of $20,000 a year, the widow, per se, would receive $15,000 a year, and if she had one <span class="highlight">child</span> she would receive $20,000 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I do make these points: We see the Schools Commission as having a function in relation to the education of every <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see it as having a function in relation to children attending single schools or who are within systems which are conducted by the Commonwealth Government, by State governments and by independent authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not interested in giving each <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia an opportunity as an individual member of a free society to be able to obtain an education as an individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some weeks there has been a continuing struggle between the Government and Opposition, the background or the basis of which has been the attitude of the Government that education grants should be determined almost solely on a needs basis, and the attitude of the Opposition which could be summed up in the words that there should be equal treatment for every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On all the other issues we will go along with what we regard as an armistice because the DLP will continue to campaign at all times for equality of treatment for every <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australian schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not recognise any system of apartheid under which some children will have prior treatment over other children according to the schools that they attend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there should be an obligation on it to look after every <span class="highlight">child</span> and not just those in government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been trying to tell the people of Australia, particularly honourable senators opposite, that we look on education as being the right of every Australian citizen, of every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span>, from the kindergarten right through to university. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is more noble an ambition than to see one’s children properly educated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A little <span class="highlight">child</span> of perhaps 2 years may initially have had some form of appendicitis, but then it was discovered that there was an additional complication. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I noticed that in the honourable senator’s heartrending example of a <span class="highlight">child</span> of 2 years who was ill, he said that it was the terrible members of the Australian Medical Association who had the skill and the knowledge to diagnose the <span class="highlight">Child</span>’s illness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person would have to be about 15 years of age with a couple of children to receive that deduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Minister would say: ‘Well, if you do not have any children on $20 a week you have to pay $ 1 6.20. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if you have a <span class="highlight">child</span> we will let you in for nothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Council was the brain <span class="highlight">child</span> of the United Australian Party Government- the confederate of the Liberal-Country Party Opposition today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government does not recognise the basic principle which it is prepared to apply in relation to other legislation, to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and tertiary eduction- the principle that everyone is entitled to equal treatment to a base degree and that extra provision can be made if it is considered necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Little else need be said other than that the Liberal Party stands by the principle which it holds; that is, that a base per capita grant should be available to every <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia who wishes to avail himself of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill, as amended, does not ensure justice for all children but it does guarantee that every Australian school <span class="highlight">child</span> in 1974 and 1975 will share in the per capita finance made available by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No <span class="highlight">child</span> should be penalised because some political party or some advisory board believes the wealth or poverty of a school should be the deciding factor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not giving aid to schools; we are giving aid to Australian children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When people say that Scotch College in Melbourne or St Joseph’s College in Sydney should not be given any money because they are wealthy schools, they are saying that every one of the children attending those schools is a wealthy <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody who has had any association with those schools knows perfectly well, firstly, that very large numbers of scholarships are given to children who are in need and who attend those schools and, secondly, that many of the children who attend them do so because their parents make sacrifices and in many cases both the father and the mother work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it is said that assistance is being taken away from these schools, actually the assistance is being taken away from the <span class="highlight">child</span> and his father and mother who are making sacrifices in order to maintain him at one of those schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said at the time that the matter is not one of schools but of Australian school children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is rather interesting to note that if a wealthy man sends his <span class="highlight">child</span> to a state school his wealth does not matter because the Government provides all the schooling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if he decides to send his <span class="highlight">child</span> to what might be termed a betteroff school he is discriminated against. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Act provides, and this Bill repeats, that the court must regard the interests of the children as the paramount consideration, but otherwise the court may make such order as it considers proper in the circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill enables the court, in a divorce case where there is a <span class="highlight">child</span> under 18 years, or in any contested proceedings for custody or guardianship of a <span class="highlight">child</span> under 1 8, to order the parents to attend a conference with a welfare officer to discuss the welfare of the <span class="highlight">child</span>, with a view to ironing out any differences between the parties as to matters affecting the welfare of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is thus hoped that greater use will be made of the skills of welfare officers in matters relating to custody, access and the general welfare of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed that greater use will be made of reports by <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare officers who will, in the case of the Superior Court, be attached to the Court itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hoped it will be possible to have a <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare reportand a quick report- at least in every contested custody or access case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill allows the <span class="highlight">child</span> itself, or any responsible organisation concerned with the welfare of children, to apply to the court for separate representation of the <span class="highlight">child</span> on the hearing of an application for custody, guardianship or access. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that persons become adult at 18, orders for guardianship, custody or access are to be made only in respect of a <span class="highlight">child</span> under 18, and cease upon the <span class="highlight">child</span> becoming 18 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, the Bill provides specifically that the court is not to make a custody order that is contrary to the wishes of a <span class="highlight">child</span> who has reached 16 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it may do so in special circumstances, such as where the <span class="highlight">child</span> is mentally defective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To give court orders for custody and access more strength the Bill provides that a court can penalise a person in a variety of ways for removing a <span class="highlight">child</span> from the care and control of the parent entitled to custody or access in contravention of the order, for failing to deliver up a <span class="highlight">child</span> when required to do so by an order, or for preventing a person entitled to access from exercising that right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, the Bill lays down the general proposition that a spouse is liable to maintain the other spouse to the extent that the other spouse is unable to support himself or herself adequately; and that both spouses are liable to maintain their children according to their respective financial resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill then makes an exception to this general proposition by providing that where spouses are separated or, of course, divorced neither is entitled to be maintained by the other unless he or she has the custody, care or control of an infant <span class="highlight">child</span> meaning, of course, one under the age of 18; or if he or she is unable to support himself or herself adequately, whether by reason of age or physical or mental incapacity for work or for any other reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the general reduction of the age of majority, it is thought that maintenance orders should cease upon a <span class="highlight">child</span> attaining the age of 18 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Bill has regard to the fact that some persons of 1 8 are still being educated and it does enable an order to extend beyond 18 to enable a <span class="highlight">child</span> to complete its education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a <span class="highlight">child</span> over 18 is permanently incapacitated for work it would, of course, be eligible for an invalid pension under the social services legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for 2 types of injuctions injunctions arising out of the marital relationship, such as for the personal protection of a party to the marriage or a <span class="highlight">child</span> of the marriage, and injunctions in aid of other orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An education allowance was also paid where an officer left a senior secondary student <span class="highlight">child</span> in Melbourne for the remainder of a school year or term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-84-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your petitioners believe in the principle that every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span>, irrespective of the school he attends, is entitled to economic support for his basic educational needs from the funds placed at the disposal of the Australian Government through taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#subdebate-9-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, they believe that this economic support should be in the form of per capita grants which are directly related to the cost of educating an Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> in a government school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#subdebate-9-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should acknowledge the right of every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> to equal per capita grants of government money spent on education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#subdebate-9-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that not one <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre has been established or even commenced in South Australia in the last 15 months, although many applications have been received? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But even a school <span class="highlight">child</span> of 5 years of age- a <span class="highlight">child</span> in the first year of school- knows that the DLP could never become a government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party policy speech on pre-schools stated that  it  would make pre-school education available to every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Association claims that the Government is repudiating its policy, is in fact refusing to adopt the Fry report on pre-school education and is moving into a form of <span class="highlight">child</span> care instead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What about <span class="highlight">child</span> care standards to which we have directed our attention? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government take urgent steps to overcome its own internal problems so that it may take some positive steps to implement a preschool and <span class="highlight">child</span> care scheme to ensure that even more educational institutions are not forced to close down? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet they talk about us as if somehow or other we are running the Senate, whereas every educated <span class="highlight">child</span> in the community knows that there is a temporary defect in democracy in the community in that the Government, elected by the people, is being frustrated in its will by those senators opposite who are yelping out and not letting me speak freely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it certainly has proved to be far closer to democracy than first past the post voting, which was the love <span class="highlight">child</span>, if I may call it that, of the Labor Party for a considerable period of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not wish to cover the ground covered by the other speakers or to explain how this Bill will lead to the imbalance of electorates that can develop when the qualification is merely the fact that a person is alive- whether an adult or a <span class="highlight">child</span> and on the rolls or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also makes allowance for financial assistance for certain persons outside Australia not qualified to receive an Australian social service pension and provides for payment of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, pensions and similar long term benefits to the credit of savings accounts with approved credit unions and also the payment of pensions and similar long term benefits to the credit of bank accounts, as has been the case with <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment since its introduction in 1 94 1 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A class A widow or a supporting mother will receive a basic pension or benefit of $26 a week, together with a mother’s allowance of $4 a week and additional pension of $5 a week for each <span class="highlight">child</span> in her care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rate of mother’s allowance is increased to $6 a week if she has a <span class="highlight">child</span> under 6 years of age or one who is an invalid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus a mother with 3 children over 6 years of age will now receive a maximum pension of $45 a week; this amount would be $47 a week if she were entitled to the higher rate of mother’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same rate of pension will be payable to a single age or invalid pensioner with children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A married pensioner couple will also qualify to supplement the basic married rate of pension fo $45.50 a week by an additional $5 for each <span class="highlight">child</span> in their care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A widow with one <span class="highlight">child</span> and no property affecting will now be able to receive income of up to $96 a week before losing her entitlement to widow’s pension, or up to $100 if her <span class="highlight">child</span> is under 6 years of age or an invalid <span class="highlight">child</span> requiring full time care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If she has no income affecting, a widow with one <span class="highlight">child</span> may have property to the value of $43,600, or $45,680 if her <span class="highlight">child</span> is under 6 years of age or an invalid requiring full-time care, before her entitlement to widow’s pension is extinguished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment is paid either by cheque each 4 weeks or by credit to a bank account at 12-weekly intervals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed that payment of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment be made to the credit of saving accounts with approved credit unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Preparations will be made to introduce this new method of payment for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment later this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although initially it will be possible to pay only <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to credit union accounts, eventually the new provisions will extend to other payments under the Social Services Act which will include all pensions, supporting mother’s benefit, sheltered employment allowance and rehabilitation allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will know, of course, that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment may be already paid in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incidentally, I notice that we are making some arrangement about the payment of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment through credit unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But nothing is said about the fact that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment is falling badly in its purchasing power all the time and that the working families dependent upon it are being robbed more and more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has got to the stage now of boasting, by saying: ‘Look what we are doing now in terms of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that the children will be delighted, and their mothers also, now that they know they can get it through a credit union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators are aware, a war widow may also receive a domestic allowance if she has a <span class="highlight">child</span>, including a student <span class="highlight">child</span>, or if she is 50 years of age or is permanently unemployable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely to a kindergarten <span class="highlight">child</span> with no experience whatever that is a wonderful proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we are trying to commit the resources of this country to the development of the best interest of every man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia, we are being told that we ought to be spending money on this, that or something else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In custody matters, the court is required by the Bill- as it is by the present Act- to regard the interests of the children as the paramount consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It enables the court in any divorce case where there is a <span class="highlight">child</span> under 1 8, or in any contested proceedings for custody of a <span class="highlight">child</span> under 18, to order the parents to attend a conference with a welfare officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose is to enable the parties, with the assistance of the welfare officer, themselves to iron out difficulties affecting the welfare of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the general reduction of the age of majority to 1 8, a maintenance order for a <span class="highlight">child</span> should cease on the <span class="highlight">child</span> attaining that age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Bill has regard to the fact that some persons of 18 are still being educated, including receiving vocational training and under apprenticeship, and it enables an order to extend beyond 1 8 for a <span class="highlight">child</span> to complete his education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, such an order may not be made unless the court is satisfied that refusal to make the order would subject the <span class="highlight">child</span> to substantial hardship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These provisions will enable a court to issue a warrant which will enable a person entitled to custody to obtain physical possession of a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already mentioned that the court may make an order for the maintenance of a <span class="highlight">child</span> over 18 to enable him to complete his education, but will be able to do so only where not making such an order would subject the <span class="highlight">child</span> to substantial hardship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new Bill also enables a maintenance order to be made in favour of a mentally or physically handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> over the age of 1 8 years, but subject to the same restriction I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable senators, I present statements by the Honourable Kim Beazley, Minister for Education, entitled ‘Interim Program for Pre-school and <span class="highlight">Child</span>-care Services and Progress under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It refers to both the pre-school and the <span class="highlight">child</span>-care programs of the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For an annual cost of $40m, which would take about six years to attain, we could provide every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> with the opportunity- a means of equalising and enriching every <span class="highlight">child</span>’s life for the rest of his life- now enjoyed fully only by children in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister went on to refer to <span class="highlight">child</span> care in the following terms: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So long as public <span class="highlight">child</span>-care facilities remain inadequate, we will allow fees paid to recognised private centres to be tax deductions to a maximum of $260 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has done it in relation to some children but not in relation to all children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will it develop a <span class="highlight">child</span> care program or will it develop a pre-school program? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Government has continued the <span class="highlight">child</span> care program which we introduced when we were in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has continued the program under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act of November 1972, which was an Act which the former Liberal-Country Party coalition Government introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I do not think that the present Government can take much credit for anything that has been done in relation to <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple position is that the Government, which is unable to reconcile its own internal differences, stands by and allows the Australian children to suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy of the Liberal and County Parties, so far as their education committee is concerned, will be to ensure that there is adequate available space for both pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> care programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As regards  Senator Rae’s  remarks about the paper that I have presented on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Education  (Mr Beazley),  I remind the Senate that the previous Government had some 23 years in which to do a lot about <span class="highlight">child</span> care, but it did very little other than to express some concern about the problem that was manifesting itself as a result of the inadequacies of the undertakings and policies pursued by the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Education set out in his statement on this interim program for pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres the assistance approved for each State as well as comments on aspects of the assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government promised that no <span class="highlight">child</span> would receive less from the Government for education than he was receiving from the then government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One cannot even rely upon the fact that children will be taught at school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These include $9m for pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, $1.7m for health services, of which $0.5m is for blood transfusion services and $0.7m for the school dental scheme, $lm for grants to the apple and pear and canning fruit industries, and $ 1 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We immediately contacted  Mr Barnard  and  Mr Crean  to ask that money be made available for the distressed widows and children of those servicemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This information has never been released but I am going to say here and now that the Government generously made money available to the extent of $14,500 to the widows and $5 a week for each <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Deputy President, The Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, the eleventh GovernorGeneral of Australia, was the last surviving <span class="highlight">child</span> of King George V and Queen Mary and died on 10 June 1974 at the age of 74 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It gave this Parliament power to legislate with respect to the provision of maternity allowances, widows pensions, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, unemployment, pharmaceutical, sickness and hospital benefits, and medical and dental services but not so as to authorise any form of civil conscription, benefits to students and family allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those who have read the history of social and economic reform will realise that the same tactics were used in respect of reforms for the introduction of the age pension, the introduction of workers’ compensation, the introduction of the 48-hour week, the 44-hour week and the 40-hour week, the imposition of restrictions on <span class="highlight">child</span> labour and the introduction of universal education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is our duty, our responsibility and our privilege to secure for every Australian man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> the quality of life that will result in achieving, or at least may help people to achieve, a way of life of their own choice but of an intellectual, material and spiritual quality, if you wish, that is not discriminatory of anyone in any way, and I do commend that to honourable senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again we see Queensland in a preferred position compared with the other States in regard to pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>An estimated amount of $8.2m is being allocated in 1973-74 as payments to the States for pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities, of which $ 1.3 m is for Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By that referendum the Government wanted to bring in not just the electors but everybody who lived in the electorates- man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span>, whether voters or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We realise that the Government, in bringing this legislation forward, is moving half way towards what it wants but it would have preferred to go much further the other way and to have everybody, adults and children, counted in the electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I remind the Minister representing the Treasurer of his statement in the Senate last week that the Social Welfare Commission report on <span class="highlight">child</span> care would be tabled in due course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the urgent need of our children in this regard, will the Minister undertake to release the report quickly? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Government make an early review of its recent decision to give <span class="highlight">child</span> care much lower priority than it undertook to give this matter during the election campaign? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In calling upon the taxpayer to subsidise big business in this way, money that could have been used for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, education or other welfare programs was no longer available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A widow with one <span class="highlight">child</span> and no property affecting will now be able to receive income of up to $106 a week before losing her entitlement to widow’s pension, or up to $110 if her <span class="highlight">child</span> is under 6 years of age or an invalid <span class="highlight">child</span> requiring fulltime care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If she has no income affecting, a widow with one <span class="highlight">child</span> may have property to the value of $48,800, or $50,880 if her <span class="highlight">child</span> is under 6 years of age or an invalid requiring full-time care, before her entitlement to widow’s pension is extinguished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Linked somewhat closely with people who receive pension incomes is the policy of the Government to defer the <span class="highlight">child</span> care program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many people in receipt of pension income have the necessity for adequate <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was with some personal disappointment that I found that once again the <span class="highlight">child</span> care program was the first item of expenditure to be deferred or to be curtailed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is with disappointment that I have been following what I hoped was the development of a <span class="highlight">child</span> care program and faculties for <span class="highlight">child</span> minding in Australia, only to find that at the first opportunity this item has been singled out for deferment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that I speak not only on behalf of the women in Australia who seek to have a greater participation in our economic activity but also on behalf of those women who need the <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities to enable them to give members of thenfamily what has been established now as the average standard in education and opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps we can talk at some later stage and at greater length of <span class="highlight">child</span> care programs and of those initiatives which the women of Australia hope to see. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We regret also that for various reasons it is impracticable to proceed with the Government’s <span class="highlight">child</span> care proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would have been able to proceed with them but for the fact that the Liberal Party and the Country Party were in government for 23 years and during that time no provision whatsoever was made for <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That denied us a base upon which to build an adequate system of <span class="highlight">child</span> care for the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government has explained the position in relation to <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is wrong for the Leader of the Opposition to attempt to attack the Government when the Government has made quite clear that the question in relation to <span class="highlight">child</span> care was not one of the Government’s cutting back expenditure but was one of the money not being able to be spent reasonably because of inflation, among other things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is, of course, determined to carry through its <span class="highlight">child</span> care program and to do what ought to be done in relation to decentralisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will be interested to know that I recall reading some years ago a report concerning the attendance of children at pre-school centres in the inner region of Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall reading that no <span class="highlight">child</span> who had been a pupil of the pre-school kindergartens in the inner region of Sydney had been before the Sydney juvenile courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the Minister my fundamental suggestions that there be co-operation with the State Government; that together with this co-operation, to show its bona fides, the Commonwealth Government must provide more money for State housing; that medium density housing be interspersed in this area; and above all, that we go back to the drawing boards and look to the needs of open space, of community centres, of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres and of all those ingredients which are now essential and fundamental to a city, all of which are not mentioned in the Minister’s second reading speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As regards custody, the main improvements contained in the Bill over existing law are: The requirement for greater use of welfare officers to try and achieve a settlement between the parties; greater opportunity for the wishes of the <span class="highlight">child</span> whose custody is in dispute to be ascertained; and more effective enforcement of custody and access orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some changes of substance have been made to Part VI, dealing with the welfare and custody of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 43 has been amended to state positively that a court must have regard to the wishes of the <span class="highlight">child</span> in custody proceedings, as part of its consideration of the welfare of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paragraph 43 (1)(b), which prevents the court from making a custody or access order contrary to the wishes of a <span class="highlight">child</span> who has attained 16 years, has been amended by lowering the age to 14 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A new sub-clause 43 ( 1 1 ) enables the Attorney-General to appoint enforcement officers for the purposes of Part VI, notably for executing warrants for taking possession of a <span class="highlight">child</span> in respect of whom an order has been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main changes of substance to those provisions are the addition of a provision for the cessation of an order in favour of a <span class="highlight">child</span> on the marriage of the <span class="highlight">child</span>, the omission of the restriction on the power to vary security for maintenance, and a restriction on the retrospectivity of any variation of a maintenance order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A change in clause 58 requires a court, in considering whether to alter the interests of a party in property, to take into account the contribution of a party to, or <span class="highlight">child</span> of, the marriage to the conservation or improvement- as well as to the acquisition- of the property in question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If those members opposite who sit to your left,  Mr Chairman,  will some day understand that they do not have a divine right to govern but that they have to earn it they might return to this side of the House a lot more swiftly than they are likely to return at the moment because the speeches that have been given here today will not stand the analysis of any secondary school <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If her <span class="highlight">child</span> happens to have difficulties and has to be put in an intensive care ward, and if the hospital cannot juggle that <span class="highlight">child</span> between a private and a public intensive care ward, that mother will have to pay some further extra hundreds of dollars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is extraordinary to imagine that sums in the vicinity of $200m a year could be envisaged for this sort of unnecessary involvement in government ownership at a time when this very Government has arbitrarily, by the stroke of a pen, taken away $ 1 30m from the area of <span class="highlight">child</span> care, and has taken away, by another stroke of a pen, $28m which has been directed to keep some sort of balance in the price of petrol throughout this vast community, throughout this vast economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it true that these benefits are normally available for only short periods to the father of an ill pre-school age <span class="highlight">child</span> and then only if it is not possible to arrange any other form of care for the <span class="highlight">child</span>, such care being entirely at his own cost? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the Interim Pre-school and <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Services Program pre-schools in the City of Knox received $32,828 to 30 June 1974 as assistance from the Australian Government towards the cost of staff salaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As part of the same program, the Australian Government also agreed to provide capital grants up to $130,000 for the establishment of a Central Services Building for a comprehensive Early Childhood Services pilot project in the City of Knox, and recurrent assistance towards the operational costs of this pilot project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party may believe that the decision to reduce the taxable education allowance struck a blow at privilege, but the decision hit not only private schooling which the Party hates so much; it also affected the parents of all children who have to wear school uniforms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government- the champion of free educationis making it difficult for children to dress decently while they are learning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government is so devoted to its cloth capped bare footed boyhood that it wants all children to experience the same type of childhood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s claim that the average cost of fitting out a school <span class="highlight">child</span> is $120, like  Mr Crean  ‘s worker on $70 a week with 3 dependants, defies ordinary imagination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the average parent with a <span class="highlight">child</span> at a state school would be very lucky to keep his costs for educating his <span class="highlight">child</span> below a grand total of $30 1 for a girl and $375 for a boy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course there is the onagainoffagainonagain <span class="highlight">child</span> care program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Originally in the May policy speech, that is before it was off-again in the minibudget, the <span class="highlight">child</span> care program was to cost $130m in the first year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In considering the needs of a majority of children it is sometimes suggested that we neglect the private schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>True it is that we consider that children in government schools have a greater educational priority than children in private schools, but since this Government came to office it has made $23i4m available to private schools for building programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They include <span class="highlight">child</span> care, our concern to protect the interests of pensioners in the community, and the development of cities and facilities and better conditions in cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An interesting example will be the Government’s program on <span class="highlight">child</span> care to which reference has already been made in this debate this evening- the <span class="highlight">child</span> care program that appears, disappears and appears again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That program envisaged the <span class="highlight">child</span> care scheme being run by local authorities as bodies which were closest to the people and hence capable of meeting the diversity of needs that exist in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be interesting to see who wins that little argument when the <span class="highlight">child</span> care program is introduced shortly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In respect of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments it was alleged that this would bring about all sorts of promiscuity and women would have babies just for the sake of being paid this benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to take the opportunity in this debate to draw the attention of honourable senators to that section of <span class="highlight">child</span> care which at the moment raises sniggers from people who do not think about it very much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw attention to the plight of children and parents in Australia who suffered for 23 years when seemingly nobody cared very much about <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that time the Government viewed the children of Australia either as pampered darlings, destined to fill the positions of privilege and status, or as some sort of factory fodder to be used to fill the needs and desires of big business and the children were educated to that end and that end alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mothers of those children were useful in that they bred the citizens who were needed to keep the system going. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the morals appropriate to that action, industry wooed the women back to the work force without a care or thought for the fate of the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not maintain that because mothers go to work their children are necessarily at risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what I say is that when mothers are not at home 24 hours a day playing their traditional role the children are at risk if society does not take steps to provide substitutes for all the roles a woman fills in the home at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>no turning the clock back now- <span class="highlight">child</span> care is of the utmost importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not speaking of the traditional educational role of the kindergartens which are open from 9 a.m. to 12 noon 4 days a week, which most fortunate children in the Australian Capital Territory and some children outside it enjoy, but the sort of care that is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for all children from the babe in arms to the teenager about to launch into the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After a period when there was a deal of discussion on what <span class="highlight">child</span> care meant and when there was a deal of work to be done to move people from the thought that <span class="highlight">child</span> care was not just kindergartens but really <span class="highlight">child</span> care, this Government within the next few weeks will establish a children ‘s commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After 23 years of neglect we found it difficult to ascertain just how much had been done to provide the sort of care our children needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is difficult to set up <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres for pre-school children if there are not sufficient trained people to staff them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children are left in unofficial minding centres, or with the lady next door, or locked up in a room for the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we came to the problem of <span class="highlight">child</span> care- we came to it cold; it was a field where very little had been done- we had to start from scratch. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of organisations and individuals were asked to make submissions because of their particular known concern in the area of <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some proposals came from professionals in the field of <span class="highlight">child</span> care and <span class="highlight">child</span> health, particularly psychiatrists and teachers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the submissions as a whole there was overwhelming evidence of interest and involvement in the care of children, mostly preschool age children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many opinions were expressed about who needed <span class="highlight">child</span> care services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some wrote about their concern for the children of working mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some focused on the need for assistance to families so that mothers need not work, while others highlighted the problems of isolation, loneliness, lack of stimulation and assistance experienced by mothers at home with their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some were concerned about the out-of-school care of school-aged children and about care during school holidays. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Presumably nobody does care because, under existing legislation, if that woman cannot prove to the satisfaction of the police- they check- that she has somewhere that night to keep her children they are taken from her and put in a State institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only body which seemingly does anything in that area at all is an entirely voluntary body which is set up specifically to aid deserted children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the body which finds the motel room in which to put the woman and the <span class="highlight">child</span> or children so that they are not broken up, so that the children do not suffer the traumatic experience of being taken away and put in a home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that now more assistance will be provided under <span class="highlight">child</span> care legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It took this Government to assist handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To our discredit, handicapped children in this community have been hidden away in much the same way as they were in the 1 9th Century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We treated children as second-class citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We conveniently forgot that all children are entitled to proper education, proper care, and have a place to fill in this society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proper care and proper education are as much concerned with what children do from the time they leave home and go into the schoolroom and what they do in their school holidays as they are about them passing exams and going to the university. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that $73m will not in the twinkling of an eye solve all the problems of <span class="highlight">child</span> care in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So when Opposition senators talk about a <span class="highlight">child</span> care problem that arrives and disappears and arrives and disappears I think they should examine their own consciences about the fact that under their Government it did not even appear, let alone have $73m spent on it as a start. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know we are not going to stop there; we know we are going to go further when it comes to caring for children . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to open up a whole world of assistance lor children and parents by way of support, counselling, stimulation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government supporters will be ever pressing for a larger share of the Budget for this very important field of <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not anticipate any sort of resistance from the community when we say we want a larger share of the Budget for <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a tremendous increase in expenditure in the Budget on education right throughout Australia but I would like to refer to only one aspect of the education provisions and that is the reduction in the tax allowance from $400 to $150 a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told that this is going to affect only the people whose children attend rich schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that working parents who must pay for <span class="highlight">child</span> minding services should be able to claim those service charges as an income tax deduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>John Gorton suggested some form of pre-school <span class="highlight">child</span> minding facilties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say unquestionably that under this concept of the new family life where for various reasons women return to work after a period of years, the provision of pre-school <span class="highlight">child</span> minding facilties is a must. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They say that more money ought to be provided for defence, for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, in addition we have allocated $75m to ensure that the Government’s program for preschool and <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities gets under way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say briefly that it is an iniquitous thing that the tax allowance for education should have been reduced from $400 to $150 a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a situation of spiralling inflation, reducing the amount to $150 will be an attack on practically everybody who has children at school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no question here of attacking children at independent schools, if that is what honourable senators opposite want to attack. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in this instance they are attacking not only that section of the community which sends its children to independent schools; they are attacking practically everybody who has children at school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly in country areas in New South Wales very often $150 would be eaten up in the cost of bus fares for children travelling to and from school, let alone in the cost of text books, school clothes and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It says that it should tell every person who has a <span class="highlight">child</span> at school that it is going to reduce the taxation concession from $400 a year to $ 1 50 a year for every <span class="highlight">child</span> at State school or an independent school because there must be restraint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In his Budget Speech the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  announced the Government’s intention of increasing additional payments for children of pensioners and beneficiaries by 50c a week to $5.50 a week, raising supplementary assistance and supplementary allowance, for pensioners and sickness beneficiaries, by $1 a week to $5 a week, and increasing double orphan’s pension by $ 1 a week to $ 1 1 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer also announced the proposed introduction of a new allowance called handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This allowance will be payable at the rate of $ 10 a week to parents or guardians of physically or mentally handicapped children who are cared for in a family environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The total amount payable is increased to $53 a week if the pensioner or supporting mother has the custody, care and control of a <span class="highlight">child</span> under six or an invalid <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Double orphan’s pension is paid in respect of a <span class="highlight">child</span> both of whose parents, or adoptive parents, are dead or where one is dead and the whereabouts of the other are unknown to the claimant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pension has proved of considerable assistance to people caring for children who, in the circumstances outlined, have permanently lost all contact with their parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>State welfare departments make financial assistance available to people caring for children who are under State control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Double orphan’s pension is akin to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and it was never envisaged by the Australian Government that it should relieve the States of expenditure in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would now like to give the Senate some details of the Government’s proposals relating to the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rate of the allowance will be $10 a week and it will be paid where, because of the nature and severity of the handicap, the <span class="highlight">child</span> requires constant care and attention in the family home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allowance is designed specifically to assist parents and guardians who have a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 years of age requiring constant attention and who, for reasons that all such persons will understand, prefer to provide this attention at home rather than place the <span class="highlight">child</span> in an institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is recognised that most persons who have a severely handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> in the home incur additional expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This new allowance should be seen in the context of the broad program of education, training and general welfare for handicapped children being developed by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parents or guardians who care for a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> at home will be encouraged to take full advantage of the facilities that are being made available under the general welfare program and the <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s attendance at a day school or training centre will not affect eligibility for payment of the allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allowance will be paid as an addition to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and will therefore will be available either by cheque at four-weekly intervals, or paid into a bank or similar account each 12 weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is estimated that some 20,000 children will qualify for the allowance and that the annual cost will be approximately $10m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, unmarried Australian girls who give birth to a <span class="highlight">child</span> while residing overseas are required to serve a period of 5 years’ residence in <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A woman with a <span class="highlight">child</span> of her own or a <span class="highlight">child</span> who entered her care before she became a widow is a class A widow and attracts payment of a mother’s allowance and additional pension for the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A class B widow is one who has no <span class="highlight">child</span> of her own or has no <span class="highlight">child</span> who entered her care before she became a widow and who is not less than 50 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A woman who ceases to be a class A widow because her qualifying <span class="highlight">child</span> turns sixteen or ceases to be a full time student, may become a class B widow if she is at least 45 years of age at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Class B widows at present receive the same basic pension as class A widows but they do not receive the mother’s allowance nor the additional pension for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand an unmarried woman may be granted an age pension at age 60 or an invalid pension and, in addition, receive additional pension for each <span class="highlight">child</span> in her care, and guardian’s allowance irrespective of whether she is the mother of the children and irrespective of the date the children entered her care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is therefore proposed to enable a mother’s allowance and additional pension for children to be payable to class B widows who have the custody, care and control of any <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions relating to the new handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance will come into operation on 30 December 1 974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Increases are now proposed in the rates of pensions payable to the children of veterans who died from service-related causes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed to increase by $1.20 to $10.45 the pension payable to each such <span class="highlight">child</span> who is in the care of its mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where the <span class="highlight">child</span> has neither mother nor father, the rate will be increased by $2.40 to $20.90. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This allowance is paid to a widow who has a dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> or children, including fulltime students, a widow who is over the age of 50 years, or one who is unemployable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allowances paid under the soldiers’ children education scheme to students undertaking secondary education, or industrial or agricultural training, will be increased by about 13 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increases will range from 45c to $2.25 and the new rates from $3.70 to $ 1 8.80 depending on the <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s age and whether it is necessary to live away from home to undertake study. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall, about 4,500 children are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there will be an increase in the addition to pension payable in respect of children in the custody, care and control of the pensioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The addition in respect of each <span class="highlight">child</span> will be increased by the Bill by 50c to $5.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Did the motion passed in another place on 13 September 1973 call for a royal commission to include in its terms of reference that the commissioners should have regard to the United Nations declaration on the rights of the <span class="highlight">child</span> and the sanctity and preservation of human life? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why do the terms of reference, published on 21 August 1974 by the Special Miniser of State, confine themselves to matters of sexual practice, abortion and so on and why specifically do they not include the concern for the rights of children and for human life set out in the resolution of the Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One provision says that children’s opinions, views and wishes on matters of custody should be taken into account by the court when it is making orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is a further provision which says that where a <span class="highlight">child</span> is 14 years of age or over, no order shall be made contrary to the wishes of that <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some children of 14 years of age are mature; others are strongly under the influence of one parent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, it would be undesirable to deny a court the opportunity to make a decision on all the facts, and we believe that this embellishment on the general regard for a <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s wishes should be removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A party to a marriage is liable to maintain the other party, to the extent that the first-mentioned party is reasonably able to do so, if, and only if, that other party is unable to support herself or himself adequately, whether by reason of having the care or control of a <span class="highlight">child</span> of the marriage who has not attained the age of 18 years, or by reason of age or physical or mental incapacity for gainful employment or for any other adequate reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Non-support by spouses or parent will be ranged alongside those other vicissitudes of life- unemployment, sickness, industrial injury, <span class="highlight">child</span> birth, death itself- for which social insurance should make provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A family’s options are also frequently limited by a lack of <span class="highlight">child</span> day-care centres and nursery schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If women become better educated and liberated they may wish to return to the work force, and the men in society may have to take over more of the role of home making and <span class="highlight">child</span> rearing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Modern contraceptive practice has enabled women to control <span class="highlight">child</span> bearing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It made the point that marriage is being entered into at a younger age and <span class="highlight">child</span> bearing is being controlled and compressed into a much shorter period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Professor Julian Katz, professor of <span class="highlight">child</span> psychiatry at the University of Sydney, recently at a large Sydney hospital discussed divorce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He commented, as we all know, that divorce is a crisis in the lives of all the people involved- the two parents and the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see them operating to offer therapy to people at a time of crisis, to help children through a period when they are likely to get very disturbed, and to help men and women who have to make decisions about their own worth and future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attention should be given to helping people to live better in the divorced state and to getting the children used to the idea that they are going to exist without one or other parent in the house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>of rule 204 of these Rules, the total amount paid by the spouse of the claimant for the maintenance of the claimant, of the <span class="highlight">child</span> or of the claimant and the <span class="highlight">child</span>, as the case may be, since the date of the assessment (excluding so much of any maintenance so paid as relates to a period preceding the date specified in the assessment in pursuance of paragraph (b) of that sub-rule). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also true that it imposes upon the parties to a marriage a legal duty to maintain their children until the children are aged 18 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill provides also for separate representation of a <span class="highlight">child</span> before a court under clause 44. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It clearly states, with respect to the custody of, guardianship of or access to children of a marriage, that the court shall regard the welfare of the children as the paramount consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So often the hours of care that these fathers need to give to quite young children make it difficult for them to continue in the work for which they have been trained and in which they have been engaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that this sort of recognition is given perhaps at the same time as we are talking about the need for <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities for all of the children of working parents in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is an argument advanced that there should be a notion of <span class="highlight">child</span> maintenance instead of wife maintenance, and in theory I would like to agree with that theory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be nice to believe that if the man obtained custody of the children the ex-wife would then make the same sort of financial contribution to their upkeep as the ex-husband would in the reverse situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be nice if the theory could be carried out that women did not need maintenance and that <span class="highlight">child</span> maintenance were the only sort of maintenance we needed to consider. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I understand it, guilt or innocence is no longer to be taken into account when determining which party to the divorce is most suited to have custody of the <span class="highlight">child</span> or children under 18 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I might add that once a woman is 7 months pregnant she is allowed off the night shift, which is something, and when she has the baby she is allowed to feed it but at 56 days she has to wean it and then the <span class="highlight">child</span> is taken off to a nursery and the mother goes back to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the court may make such order or grant such injunction as it thinks proper with respect to the matter to which the proceedings relate, including an injunction for the personal protection of a parly to the marriage or of a <span class="highlight">child</span> of the marriage or for the protection of the marital relationship or in relation to the property of a party to the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The extension of the provisions of the legislation to include them is a measure which is commendable, lt will be of assistance not only to the handicapped adults themselves but also to the quite elderly parents who have cared for a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> until he has reached adulthood and is still in need of personal care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In doing so the rate of benefit has been increased from $3 to $3.50 a day, and provision made to enable short absences, such as when the <span class="highlight">child</span> returns home for a weekend, to be disregarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is more than sufficient evidence to show that television plays a large part in the lives and development of Australian children, that the entertainment programs provided now and any time during the 18 years of Australian television have not, except in rare and isolated cases, been of a quality to advantageously influence children’s development in any area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that this Bill is a complex Bill covering such matters as increased tax liabilities for the mining industry, the imposition of taxation on fringe benefits, special allowance of deductions for depreciation of <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities, reduction of the limit on deduction for education expenses, the deductibility of mortgage interest payments, a reduced level of the special deduction allowable to life assurance companies, a rebate of dependants’ allowances for low income families, technical amendments of the principal Act with respect to dividends payable from Papua New Guinea, the relief of taxpayers in cases of hardship and provisional tax for 1974-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As to the provisions regarding <span class="highlight">child</span> care and the provisions regarding non-resident dependants, the Opposition places no qualification or obstruction on those matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why, today if a couple of uniforms, a couple of pairs of shoes and some sports clothes are bought for a <span class="highlight">child</span>, that purchase in itself exceeds $150. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does he seriously say- and this is importantthat in the year 1974, and prospectively next year, the average cost to a parent of state school children will be $ 1 50 or less? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What a quaint thing it is that those who attack the independent schools and who stand up here talking as they do about these things send their own children to independent schools and, if I may say so by interpolation, come along to Liberals and ask their help to get their children into those schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If a taxpayer sends his <span class="highlight">child</span> to a State school, primary school fees of approximately $600 a year and high school fees of at least $900 or $1,000 a year of taxpayers’ money are saved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means that those people who send their children to independent schools will now have to pay substantially more in 2 waysbecause of inflation in fees and because of the reduction in the tax allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Socialist and communist writers throughout history have said that it is necessary to teach the <span class="highlight">child</span> at its most impressionable age the principles of socialism and communism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People overseas perhaps have heard of Australia or Sydney but that is all they know whereas the average Australian <span class="highlight">child</span>, through the comprehensive education system we have had in the past and which we want to keep, knows all about the rest of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Briefly I pass through the area of education where it is unbelievable to me, and I believe to a very large number of members of the Government, that the Government should have brought down legislation which will reduce from $400 to $ 1 50 the allowable tax deduction of money spent on a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This <span class="highlight">child</span> was adopted out with the aid of a departmental officer of the Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs and a missionary or a lay missionary- nobody is quite sure of his status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At this time, I assured you that the matter had been placed in the hands of the Commissioner of Police and that further attempt would be made to locate the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must now inform you that extensive inquiries within the State of Queensland have failed to reveal the whereabouts of the <span class="highlight">child</span> but the matter will be pursued further and I will write at a later date to inform you as to the outcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">child</span> was fostered out with the knowledge and responsibility of an officer of the Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs in Queensland and a preacher or a lay preacher, and they have lost all trace of her. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth respectfully showeth: whereas the Treasurer of the Australian Government has proposed that the concessional deduction for education expenses be reduced from $400 to $ 1 50, we, the undersigned, humbly petition the Senate to return any legislation which could give effect to such a proposal to the House of Representatives and request that the concessional deduction for education expenses be restored to $400 for each <span class="highlight">child</span> attending an approved school or college. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a matter of some wonder to me that this new scheme, which will disadvantage every man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> in Queensland, is being brought in mainly by the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  and the Minister for Health  (Dr Everingham)  who are Queenslanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I raise the matter of the mode of payment of subsidies and seek some enlightenment and assurance that the modes adopted will not limit in any way the right of choice of the parent in relation to the type or location of centre to which the <span class="highlight">child</span> will be sent or which the <span class="highlight">child</span> will attend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The actual adoption of children within Australia is not a function of the Federal Government; it is a function of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The applications by the prospective parents to adopt children are dealt with by the appropriate State courts, and there is really nothing that we can do about that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The children may be granted visas to enter Australia, whether they are coming from South Vietnam or from anywhere else, but in this case, we are particularly concerned with the situation in South Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Other children may be granted visas- these are the particular ones to whom  Senator Primmer  would be referring- to join prospective adoptive parents in Australia where the adoption proposals have the support of the relevant <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare authorities, which in these cases would be the various departments of community welfare and <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare in the different States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Others have not been allocated to specific parents and ultimately will be allocated, if one can use the rather inhuman word ‘allocated’ in regard to children, to the various States which no doubt will make appropriate arrangements through the different <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare organisations within those States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is abundant evidence in this country at this point of time of puny public officials in central Australia and the Northern Territory who take it upon themselves to say to an Aboriginal woman or man that they are not to get social services or <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment because in the puny mind of those officials the Aborigines might spend the money in a way that does not suit the custom of the white man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In moving to establish the Children’s Commission the Australian Government has recognised that changing social patterns have put considerable pressures on families with infant and school-age children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These changes include a growing number of families where both parents work, and of single parent families, as well as a frequently increasing sense of isolation affecting women looking after children at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through the Children’s Commission the Australian Government will provide assistance to a variety of organisations, groups and individuals for programs including full day care, family day care, pre-school education, emergency care, occasional care, before and after school and vacation care, playgroups and any other <span class="highlight">child</span> care activities in accordance with demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The functions of the Commission set out in clause 5 of the Bill embody the philosophy of providing comprehensive, co-ordinated and integrated services for children and include the concept of providing priority to those in greatest need, special needs of particular groups and flexibility in the provision of services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, of course, is consistent with the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act 1972 which was introduced by the McMahon Government just prior to the December 1972 elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill will ensure that what we are already doing in the provision of services for children will be the subject of continuing parliamentary scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While true confessions are in order, I must confess that as a <span class="highlight">child</span> I threw stones on roofs and blew up letter boxes on Empire Day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since we have stopped, in most of our state schools and private schools, steering children rigidly into a sort of academic and technical type school in 2 streams, since we have stopped putting children into these streams and giving them little hope of getting from one to the other, I think the lack of curriculum development and curriculum assessment in many schools and in many systems has left the non-academic <span class="highlight">child</span>, the <span class="highlight">child</span> who is not going on to matriculation, the <span class="highlight">child</span> who is not going on to university, in a sort of educational no-man’s land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that provided the Centre is retained with this flexible approach, provided that it does not become a rigid conformist centre of propaganda to produce curricula that every <span class="highlight">child</span> in the country must swallow daily in large doses, it can develop useful and very important concepts in the education of our children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it can take one small step towards changing the rigid approach to education that some of us knew, and perhaps few of us overcame, it will do more for the children of this country than many similar provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Obviously this atmosphere spilled over on to the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because the family welfare system is corrupt we pay <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, deserted wives pensions, widow pensions and invalid pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most of us will say that we love the <span class="highlight">child</span>; but the dark <span class="highlight">child</span> at school is referred to as a nigger, the kid with one arm is called wingy and the Vietnamese who come here and form a small group in the school will be called chows. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only one who is unhappy is the honourable member for Henty  (Mrs <span class="highlight">Child</span>)  who apparently has had the best bit carved out of her electorate to make another electorate good for someone else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet the common law allowed slavery to continue and allowed <span class="highlight">child</span> labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are others whose competing point of view is that the accent should be on <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres to supplement the needs of the mother, to establish her right to work, as well as alleviating the problems of children whose parents need to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This undercurrent of competing philosophies has bedevilled the whole field of <span class="highlight">child</span> care and needs to be resolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the fact that the Government has shown so much indecision in the past in relation to its <span class="highlight">child</span> care program and the financial needs of such a program is part of a failure to appreciate that there are these competing modes of pre-school care which both need to be included in the overall considerations and which appear now to be at least to an extent taken into account in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that there is a further complication in the fact that the Government does not adequately recognise in the legislation that there has been development through State authorities of pre-existing <span class="highlight">child</span> care programs, and my colleague  Senator Guilfoyle  will be referring in detail to the situation in Victoria which it is believed has not been adequately taken into account and which is indicative of the developments in other States of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Opposition believes that it would be far better to establish a children’s bureau whose functions would be to faciliate achieving the objectives of pre-school care and education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear to us to be preferable that such a children’s bureau, sensitive to a number of social issues related to the care of children and allowing social sensitivity to be much sooner and better realised, would be better than a somewhat bureaucratic structure subject to the failings that any bureaucratic structure tends to have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that there are examples of the fads that have existed in <span class="highlight">child</span> care and the institutionalisation of <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without a lot of social upheaval in this area it is impossible as a short term overall objective, for the inescapable fact is that it is the private sector through people’s own capital investment in buildings and equipment which is bearing so much of the brunt and enabling fewer children in the community to be so-called latch key children than otherwise would occur if that sector were squeezed out of business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe it is an important sector, which must be recognised in the administration under the proposed legislation of the Children ‘s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In their traditional context, <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres have catered for working mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres there has been a shift away from the purely custodial care of children, as it is becoming increasingly obvious that in the earlier years the <span class="highlight">child</span> is learning at the fastest rate during his whole educational span. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the implementation of a coherent <span class="highlight">child</span> care policy we believe it is important that extensive research into the needs of this area be undertaken and continued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would expect that the children’s bureau, which we propose as an alternative approach, would take this up as a major activity and draw information from all sectors covered under the departmental framework of what we see as community development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This may take the form of encouraging parents to form cooperatives to run <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres within communities, either alone or in association with relevant municipalities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It should be feasible for parents who wish to establish their own pre-school or <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre to have certain field information concerning management and administration made available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also should be feasible for parents not only to control the administration of these centres but also to be involved in an advisory capacity, as already occurs in so many areas connected with the care and education of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This may be done by establishing workshops with parents periodically discussing problems with people skilled in various aspects of <span class="highlight">child</span> education and welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are glad to see that in the services to children provision is made to enable that to happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that that will be one of the important tasks undertaken by the Children’s Commission in carrying out its functions under the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the sort of thing that could be done through a children’s bureau, where pooling resources in the area would help to facilitate achievement of the objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need to enable parents to obtain access to the latest pre-school education and care thinking is another important role to be undertaken by the Children’s Commission or the children’s bureau. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important, when talking about the play group and the parent involvement question, to remember one of the problems which have their effect upon children in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the development of the play group and the involvement of parents in the pre-school care and education are things which will have their effect not only directly upon the <span class="highlight">child</span> but also indirectly upon the <span class="highlight">child</span> by making the mother a happier person and a person better able to participate in the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s development from a favourable point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is nothing worse, of course, than being a <span class="highlight">child</span> with a mother who is upset and lonely as a result of so many of the pressures of the type of society which we seem to be developing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any steps which the Children’s Commission takes towards involving parents will have that dual benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In discussing industry one must, I believe, have regard to the fact that there are dangers as well as benefits in linking <span class="highlight">child</span> care and education directly with a particular industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Benefits are to be obtained by siting <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities close to large places of employment; but to have them totally tied is to run the risk, we believe, of tying the mother and reducing her right of choice of employment because she may experience the fear that if she exercises the right to change her employment she will have to change the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s place of care and education and the <span class="highlight">child</span> will have to get used to new people, and that may be to the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s disadvantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We therefore raise a caveat in relation to the development of industrial <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, believing that it may be better to concentrate upon locating them in industrial areas near large employing industries but with them not necessarily being totally run by those particular industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One cannot get away from the major problem of <span class="highlight">child</span> care, and that is the expense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maintenance of a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a centre costs in excess of $ 1 ,000 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The capital cost for each <span class="highlight">child</span> for the establishment of the traditional <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre is something approaching $3,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not pause to engage in the inflation debate; I simply indicate that the costs in relation to <span class="highlight">child</span> care are high indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one is talking about something like 1.3 million children being in the age group with which we are concerned and if one is talking about the sorts of costs involved in relation to each of them, one can see that the amount involved is very great. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consistent with all of the policies of the Opposition is that all children should have an equal right to adequate pre-school education, especially if one realises that it is in this area that educational advantage first becomes manifest and the whole problem of social deprivation and subsequent delinquency has its origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again this raises the problem of the balance intended under this legislation between the States- which have done a great deal, some more than others, in developing both standards and support for the provision of <span class="highlight">child</span> care- and the Commonwealth bureaucracy which will be created and which on the face of it will have the power to bypass those State organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are concerned also to ensure that adequate attention is given to encouraging parents to look after their own children so far as possible, and to ensure that economic necessity does not deprive parents of the exercise of choice in this respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst we are not in any way denying the right of women to choose to work, nor are we failing to recognise the need for many women to work, we wish to remind the Government of the importance to a <span class="highlight">child</span> of having its mother able to look after it rather than having some substitute care provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, believing that the family unit is of fundamental importance to our society and that steps should be taken to encourage mothers to be able freely to exercise a choice and to stay home to look after their children, we believe that steps must be taken by this Government to facilitate that choice and that so far as the <span class="highlight">child</span> care program of the Children’s Commission is concerned adequate emphasis must be given to that aspect which, if one reads the Bill, one gets the feeling is not intended to be part of the function of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A second point we make is that, as existing private <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres provide over 70 per cent of the present care, they should receive adequate recognition and encouragement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not suggest that they should be developed to the exclusion of other forms of <span class="highlight">child</span> care, but it would be unreal for anyone to suggest that they are not significant in Australia now or to suggest that they have not got a major contribution to make in the provision of advice and the lessons from experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is at present a considerable fear among a number of Australian kindergartens that they will either be ignored or inadequately encouraged in carrying out their responsibilities to children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again I believe it would be of advantage if the Minister could indicate when concluding the debate just what is proposed in relation to kindergartens- whether it is true, for instance, that the person who is likely to be administering the Children’s Commission role in the city of Sydney has indicated that that person will be imposing very substantial requirements on kindergartens that will change the whole way in which they will be operating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We wish to stress the importance of continuing research, as I mentioned earlier, into the best method of providing <span class="highlight">child</span> care, the expansion of family day care programs, subject to suitable supervision and regulation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The creation of another commission outside existing departments will further fragment social policy-making and the administration of <span class="highlight">child</span> care and family welfare programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The trend should be to integrate and not fragment family and <span class="highlight">child</span> care programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Policies and programs, which vitally affect families and children, are already spread over several departments including Social Security, Health, Tourism and Recreation, Labor, Aboriginal Affairs and Education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder what the Government is doing in relation to the important aspect of giving taxation relief as regards cost to parents of preschool children or in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In approaching this question I do not think I can give adequate consideration to it without receiving some comment about whether the Government proposes to honour its promises in relation to the tax deductibility of at least a percentage of the cost to parents of payments to <span class="highlight">child</span> care or pre-school facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also has a specific interest in this case because there are many groups who believe that it is of the utmost importance that there be a ‘representative’ on the Children’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Rae also mentioned that existing private <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres provide an adequate and significant contribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It includes grants for such projects as mobile toy libraries, the construction of kindergarten centres and pre-school centres, repairs to houses used by play groups, outofschool centre staffing, provision for children’s camps and provision of equipment and staff for socially and emotionally disturbed adolescentsa wide range of provisions to assist in the full development of all children in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia itself must benefit, as any other country would benefit, through culturally and socially adjusted children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I query  Senator Rae’s  statement that a <span class="highlight">child</span> should have its mother at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer him to a number of psychologists and psychiatrists who believe that we tend to create a mother image in our children, that we leave them with a single image and that this is not always to the benefit of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be to the benefit of the mother, but it may not necessarily be to the benefit of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly would not like to see industry or any industrial organisation setting up a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre, a pre-school centre or an after school centre that was not fully contained in the provisions of the Children’s Commission Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sum of $43m will go a long way towards providing some of the facilities for children that are essential in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I express my appreciation to the Interim Committee of the Children’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague,  Senator Rae,  referred to the establishment of a Children’s Bureau as part of the Opposition’s policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, to settle for anything less in <span class="highlight">child</span> care than the very best care that can be given would be to do something that is completely contrary to our view and, I suspect, contrary also to the view of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if we do not have co-ordination between the State and local government bodies and the federal bodies it is unlikely that we will have the ideal type of <span class="highlight">child</span> care in this country in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been delays in the implementation of any program with regard to <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact it is far too many years ago that we first started talking about <span class="highlight">child</span> care opportunities and facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, an entirely State administered standing committee on pre-school <span class="highlight">child</span> development has been established in Victoria to examine the philosophy of pre-school <span class="highlight">child</span> development and to implement the report of a consultative council on pre-school <span class="highlight">child</span> development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pre-school care and education is regarded as being essential to the work of the Children’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would have thought that the work that has been done on that aspect in one State would not need to be duplicated because it would be in that State that it would function for the children of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Victoria has also established a consultative council on maternal and <span class="highlight">child</span> health under the chairmanship of Professor Clarke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been asked to make recommendations as to the provision of services to the pre-school <span class="highlight">child</span> as well as in the area of school medical services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal of the Special Minister of State, as is contained in the Commonwealth Government’s legislation, completely cuts across the agreement reached between the Victorian Government and the Commonwealth and would render invalid and unnecessary the joint State-Commonwealth informal advisory committee and enable the Commonwealth Government to embark upon destructive policies in total contravention of the consultative council’s report on pre-school <span class="highlight">child</span> development in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer, first, to the term ‘services for children’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore understood that almost any service could be defined within the Commission’s operations as being a service applicable to children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason we wonder what the definition of the special needs of children would embrace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The definition of a <span class="highlight">child</span> in special need as set out in section 12 of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act will not be used as it does not adequately cover a <span class="highlight">child</span> in special need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of the fairly liberal definition of services for children’ in this Bill, we would like to see more clearly defined what the Government would intend to be the requirement concerning children in special need and how it sees that functioning as a service provided by the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that it has not been made clear that this service will include all children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact considerable emphasis has been placed on the children who will have services provided for them while they are out of their homes, whereas there seems to have been no accent placed on services being provided for children who may require them in their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not to suggest that we envisage a program being conducted by the Commonwealth Government that will involve an intrusion into the homes of every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> in order to impose services but rather, as  Senator Rae  has stressed, that we feel that a great deal of the development of the <span class="highlight">child</span> necessarily involves a close relationship with the parents of that <span class="highlight">child</span> within that <span class="highlight">child</span>’s home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would commend the fact that sometimes services in the home are a means of enabling that <span class="highlight">child</span> to remain in the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The supportive services for a disadvantaged <span class="highlight">child</span> or a <span class="highlight">child</span> with disabilities could be embraced in the services to the <span class="highlight">child</span> in the home as well as outside the home, for the reasons which I have stated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Schools Commission there is emphasis on providing the highest standards, making education available to all children at such standard without fee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If high standards and skilled staff are recognised in those 2 commissions, I believe it is even more important that the Children’s Commission should recognise that high standards and skilled staff are essential if we are to provide the standard of service that we believe is required by children in their very early and formative years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to see a positive statement of such an aim made by the  Chairman  or by the Children’s Commission so that we would see that there is not just emphasis on quantity of <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities or after school clubs but rather on the quality of the services provided for the needs of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did not mention the rights of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of recognising the rights of children and of every person in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To relate any provision of <span class="highlight">child</span> care simply to the women in Australian society overlooks the fact that both parents have equal responsibilities in the care of their children and that the children have the fundamental and essential rights which are part of the Declaration of Human Rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that part of the Declaration of Human Rights which relates to children is very beautifully expressed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that regard I would like to say that I would have expected more definition of the program that the Federal Government may have had in mind to implement the promise of the Prime Minister of one year’s pre-school education for every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I accept that proposition, but I would like to think that in the formation of the Children’s Commission some opportunity would be taken to see that it is representative of the skills which are required for people to make decisions in this important area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the debate in the House of Representatives on the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Bill 1 972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister shall appoint persons with qualifications in pre-school education, pediatricians, psychologists, educationalists and <span class="highlight">child</span> psychiatrists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government intends to move into the fields of full day care, family day care, preschool education, emergency care, occasional care, before and after school and vacation care, play groups and any other <span class="highlight">child</span> care activities in accordance with demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it continues for very long, the Government will not need the Children’s Commission at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As was stated by the Government in another place, the Children’s Commission will take its place beside the School’s Commission, the Technical and Further Education Commission, the Australian Universities Commission and the Commission of Advanced Education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the other place the word ‘education’ was used in its widest sense, meaning the total development of the personality of a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Hansard of the other place indicates that it was stated that ‘education’ means not just education but the total development of the personality of a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the points that  Senator Rae  makes is that the private sector- that is, the commercial <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres- should be recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incidentally, the Opposition, when in government, passed the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act which restricts assistance to non-profit organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further point raised was whether pre-school <span class="highlight">child</span> care would be included in these proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some difficulties in relation to the question whether <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres should be attached to industries because it may tend to anchor a mother to a particular industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although prima facie it sounds a good proposition to have these <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres attached to industries, it would, I think, if one thinks about it, incline to anchor a mother to a particular industry rather than allowing her to move further out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind you,  Mr President,  that the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act was passed by the McMahon Government because it recognised that an increasing number of mothers were going out to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose, according to  Senator Sheil,  what was done by that great socialist, the honourable Phillip Lynch, who introduced the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Bill, ought not to be done by us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There does not appear to be any specific encouragement for parents who elect to care for their own children on a full-time basis rather than taking the alternative of working and making use of <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities provided and encouraged pursuant to this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The definition provides for a wide range of services for children throughout the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some services are directed specifically towards children whose parent or parents are working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would anyone be prepared to say that these children do not have a need for care? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1972 the then Minister for Labour and National Service, the Honourable Phillip Lynch, introduced a <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Bill which was the McMahon Government’s sole contribution to legislation in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is worth examining the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act to see what assistance was given to the children of parents who were not employed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act was designed to cater for the children of working parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By introducing this Bill the Government recognises that all children should have access to a comprehensive range of children’s services to meet their needs, and the scope of the definition of ‘services for children’ is deliberately quite wide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, paragraph (b) refers to ‘the education of pre-school aged children’, paragraph (f) refers to ‘assistance to, and counselling of, parents in relation to the raising of children’, and paragraph (g) refers to ‘other services’, and obviously applies to all children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sub-clause (4) refers to circumstances where parents are prevented, by reasons of illness or of an emergency, as well as by reason of being engaged in employment, from caring adequately for a <span class="highlight">child</span> in its own home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Physically or mentally disabled or handicapped children are able to attract these services when they are not cared for in their own homes but fit children who are being cared for in their own homes are excluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the Government’s attention to this aspect and to the concern of people who do care for their sick children for periods of time and who could benefit from supportive services that may be available, even the short term supportive services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel sure that the usual definition would be applied to physically or mentally disabled or handicapped children as we know it in other Acts and they are included if they are not in their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A sick <span class="highlight">child</span> who may be consistently sick and whose parents may need some supportive services is excluded under paragraph (e). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Government should give attention to this and consider whether the sick <span class="highlight">child</span> being cared for in its own home should attract some supportive service from this Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act 1972, which as I said before was introduced by the Liberal and Country Party Government, provided for direct payments to non-profit organisations for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act, this Bill provides for advisory boards to enable consultation with State governments, local government and the voluntary agencies involved in providing children’s services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act payments were being made directly to the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres and the States were not able to apply for moneys. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State can ask for money for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, or the individual <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres can ask for money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incidentally, that provision was not in the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act, which was much more restrictive than this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did not have that flexibility in the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the Government’s firm intention that by 1980 all children in Australia will have access to services designed to take care of their educational, emotional, physical, social and recreational needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the real strengths of the Government’s program is that it will break down the false dichotomy between <span class="highlight">child</span> care and pre-schooling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not wish to create a situation in which people are chosen to try to cover the whole spectrum of skills that would be interested in <span class="highlight">child</span> care but to pick them for the particular expertise they have irrespective of what their professions might be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I support the comments of  Senator Rae  with regard to the proposed State and Territory Children’s Commission Advisory Boards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that we could be reaching a stage in this Bill at which we are talking about <span class="highlight">child</span> care taking priority over pre-school education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There needs to be some relationship between the preschool planning in the various States and the provision of what might be additional <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities for those children who have working parents away from the home during several hours of each day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we ought to be questioning whether there is co-ordination between the kindergartens or pre-school centres in the various States and what might be attempted under the Children’s Commission with the <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities that are to be developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to think that we are not placing in contrast the pre-school opportunities with the <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the State advisory bodies are the best organisations to advise the new Children’s Commission on what plans are already in existence and how they may facilitate the overall concept of improved services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Guilfoyle raised the point, I took it to be, of just how this thing might develop in a practical situation and not what is the intention of the legislation and as to whether there would be some rub between pre-school education and the provision of <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we want to do in the whole of this matter is have a look at the overall situation of what is demanded by the <span class="highlight">child</span> itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A second feature which I think is worrying many of them- one which probably involves a shift of responsibility- is that such matters as <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, aged persons homes and environmental protection are slowly but surely being shifted into the responsibility of local government and are bringing with them the obvious additional costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In turning to the proposal to extend the scope of double orphan’s pension I should first say that this pension was introduced by the present Government in September 1973 as a measure of assistance for people caring for children who have permanently lost the companionship, support and comfort normally provided by parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Double orphan’s pension is paid in respect of a <span class="highlight">child</span> both of whose parents, or adoptive parents, are dead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principle also extends to a <span class="highlight">child</span> one of whose parents, or adoptive parents, is dead if the whereabouts of the other are unknown to the claimant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Requests have been received from various quarters proposing that the scope of eligibility be extended to include a <span class="highlight">child</span> whose sole surviving parent is in prison or in a mental hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government feels that the position of these children is not greatly different from that of children whose parents are both dead or where one parent is dead and the whereabouts of the other unknown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly it has been decided to extend payment to a person who is caring for a <span class="highlight">child</span> one of whose parents is dead and the other serving a term of imprisonment for life or for not less than 10 years or who is a mental hospital patient and, in the opinion of the DirectorGeneral will remain so for an indefinite period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In brief, a ‘tax rebate of $400 will replace the existing deduction of $364 for a spouse, a rebate of $200 will replace the deduction of $260 for a student <span class="highlight">child</span> or for one <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 years of age, and a rebate of $150 will replace the deduction of $208 for other children under 16 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make this quite clear: Our new tax scheme removes the inequitable system of concessional deductions and replaces it with a fairer system of rebates, Further, a new allowance- a rebate of $200- is to be introduced for parents without partners who are maintaining children who qualify for concessional rebates as dependants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The definition of student for the purpose of the higher of the two rebates for children is to be extended from the present definition to include any <span class="highlight">child</span> under 25 years of age receiving full-time education at a school, college or university. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the previous, more restrictive definition, only children between the ages of 16 and 25 could qualify as a student. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For a taxpayer with a dependant wife and one <span class="highlight">child</span> who has a net income of $7,000 this year and is entitled to rebates for expenditures equal to 5 per cent of net income, tax will be $770 for 1 975-76 compared with $997 on the same income derived in 1974-75- this is a reduction of 22.8 per cent in his or her income tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will be especially interested in the conditions of service of public servants, particularly women, with respect, for example, to employment availability and the provision of <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities for those wishing to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the enactment of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act in 1972 the provision of <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities throughout Australia has expanded rapidly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there is a greater need for the integration of <span class="highlight">child</span> care and pre-school facilities as this will permit the provision of such services to many more children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is equally important, of course, to parents, particularly women, who wish to work or who require such facilities for their children so that they can participate more fully in community affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the Australian Capital Territory in particular, it is perhaps opportune to note that in this area the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance is payable at $10 a week to parents or guardians caring for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is payable in respect of physically and mentally handicapped children as a special children’s benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I ask the Minister for Social Security: In view of the confusion and the anxiety in the minds of those who are concerned with <span class="highlight">child</span> care matters in this country, will the Minister give a detailed statement of cuts to the proposed Children’s Commission expenditure? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about the fact that the advisory committees in the various States of Australia have unnumerable applications, totalling something like 600, for approval under the <span class="highlight">child</span> care, children’s services program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be said also that the Government has asked the Interim Committee for the Children’s Commission to look very actively at those projects which could claim that their activities will be closed if they do not receive funding in this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State Ministers concerned with <span class="highlight">child</span> care and pre-school facilities also have been asked to look at these projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security and Minister assisting the Prime Minister in <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware of other such ill-informed claims that the Government has no specific commitment to funding full day care services for children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has also been claimed that not a great deal has been done in <span class="highlight">child</span> care development, and the Government acknowledges this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only in the past 2 months that the Government has had any opportunity to place some emphasis on children’s services outside of the pre-school area, owing to the lack of development during the term of the previous Government in this area of work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister for Social Security and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is in the field of <span class="highlight">child</span> care- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister therefore advise where cuts making up the balance of the $9m cut made in <span class="highlight">child</span> care- that is some $7.25m- will be made? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Government, because it is anxious to place more emphasis on funding for a wider range of <span class="highlight">child</span> care programs, announced its decision to continue this funding commitment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The long term aim of the present Government is to shift the balance of funding for children’s services from an emphasis on the single pre-school and kindergarten function to a balance between the full range of services, including full day care, occasional and emergency care, toy libraries and parent education programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These arrangements will necessarily take time to implement, particularly given the previous Government’s emphasis on pre-school funding often to the exclusion of other services and the integration of facilities for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus a significant percentage of funds to be allocated for <span class="highlight">child</span> care services will go to pre-schools in the current year because of commitments that have been entered into by the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contrary to some statements made recently by honourable senators opposite, it is our policy to ensure the integration of childhood services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We thus want to ensure that there is an integration of facilities for children in the community- not just pre-school, but occasional, day care and other facilities- so that both children and parents in the community gain maximum benefit from such facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act there are a number of programs including grants for 2 centres at the Australian National University and one at the Canberra <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is provision also for assistance for the Women’s <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Collective in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Marymead family day care scheme, for the Woden Community Association family day care scheme and for assistance to the Young Men’s Christian Association ‘children in need’ program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The role of the father is equally important to that of the mother in the moulding and formation of the character of a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I acknowledge, of course, the need for the Government to provide the economic support to the family unit by way of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres and various other aspects of social welfare programs to buttress the economic welfare of the family unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But just as the benefits of Labor’s social reform policies were quickly felt in the Territory- for example, in the reduction in the price of land, the establishment of an Australian Legal Aid Office, community health centres, women’s refuges, cheaper loans for home buyers, <span class="highlight">child</span> care services and land rights for Aboriginals at Wreck Bay, so also the detrimental effects of the present Government’s ill conceived anti-Canberra policy are already causing distress and hardship to people living here in the seat of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> care survey in 1973 showed that a quarter of a million women with dependent children aged 12 or under were in the work force and about 125 000 women with dependent children under 6 years of age were in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the first time all women who, for any reason, were the sole support of children were entitled to a modest level of government assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the first time, Australians had a Government which did not merely utter hollow rhetoric about the importance of <span class="highlight">child</span> rearing and about the mother-<span class="highlight">child</span> relationship as conservative governments have done and still do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, acting on the socialist principle that the community through the auspices of government willingly assumes responsibility for its vulnerable members, the Labor Government set up the Interim Committee for the Children’s Commission to develop integrated <span class="highlight">child</span> care and development programs for pre-school age children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Inadequacies in education, job training, and <span class="highlight">child</span> care services remain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But honourable senators may agree that improvements in education, training, legal aid services, welfare services and <span class="highlight">child</span>-care, benefit the whole of society and not just women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An example which comes to mind most is the family with asthmatic children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost of getting the other children cared for while the mother attends a clinic adds to the burden and creates a situation which we believe should not exist in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this area there are people who cannot help the position in which they find themselves; there are people who have a <span class="highlight">child</span> or a family of children with chronic complaints; and there are grown-ups who have chronic complaints and who, through no fault of their own, do not have the income to deal with the costs involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Children whose mothers work have problems, children whose mothers are engaged in outside activities have problems and children who have no mother but who have a father looking after them have problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are so many men in government, including local government, who truly and honestly believe- they are not bad men- that in establishing kindergartens one is providing <span class="highlight">child</span> care, whereas we know that that is a tiny part of educating a <span class="highlight">child</span> in some ways and that it does not get down to the root of <span class="highlight">child</span> care, of after school and before school care when mothers and fathers have to go to work, of care for children whose mothers and fathers have taken ill, have gone away or have had accidents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happens to those children at the moment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well the health departments in the various States telling us that unless one provides a toilet that is 2 feet high and there are windows that are 4 feet off the ground one cannot open a <span class="highlight">child</span> care facility but the point is that for years people around the corner and down the street have minded children and for years those children have managed to deal with toilets that are a little higher than those at home and they do not seem to have come off the worse for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have to get down to in that area is looking at the people who need the care- that is the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government can be very pious about where the children are minded, why is it encouraging their mothers back into the workforce? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the children are allowed to be minded in all sorts of conditions over which nobody has any control at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The same <span class="highlight">child</span> care and other benefits should apply to supporting husbands as apply to supporting mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To begin with, the female of the human race is biologically the one to bear and nurture children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>It is also undeniable that the continuance of a stable society means stable citizens- and stable citizens come from a stable family background where the love of a mother for her <span class="highlight">child</span> is of paramount importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only assistance- that of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment- was first brought in by a Liberal Government in 1941. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was still 50c for the first <span class="highlight">child</span>, but $ 1 for the second <span class="highlight">child</span>, $2 for the third <span class="highlight">child</span> and $2.25 for all subsequent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is this meagre allowance that induces women to put their children into <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres and join the work force to keep up with the Joneses- the working sisters with their ever-increasing financial commitments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the Schools Commission, the first decent national funding of education for children throughout Australia; the interim committee on <span class="highlight">child</span> care of the Children’s Commission, which was to establish for the first time high standard, properly funded government <span class="highlight">child</span> care services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I preface my question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, by saying that no doubt the Minister is aware that a family with 4 children would receive <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment of $5.75 a week and yet if, due to divorce, the family were divided into 2 groups with each parent looking after 2 children, each group would receive only $1.50 a week- a total of $3. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Arising from the Minister’s statement on expenditure on children’s services, could she advise how many new pre-school centres have been funded this financial year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The guidelines briefly are that they will be eligible for 75 per cent funding of salaries if they provide not only a pre-school service but also an integrated <span class="highlight">child</span> care service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is that from 1 April cows’ milk substitutes will not be on the pharmaceutical benefits list for children of and over the age of 1 8 months, whereas until now they have been available for children up to the age of 6 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some children over the age of 18 months do need cows’ milk substitutes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, if a <span class="highlight">child</span> is drinking the same quantity of cows’ milk substitutes as a <span class="highlight">child</span> would normally drink of cows’ milk, the cost to parents will be $10 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make the point also that, if these substitutes are being used unnecessarily in respect of many children, they are being used because medical practitioners are prescribing these cows’ milk substitutes for the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The parent is taking the medical advice that the <span class="highlight">child</span> needs the cows’ milk substitute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The parent is not aware of whether the <span class="highlight">child</span> has a permanent condition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if a medical practitioner decides that it is a permanent condition the <span class="highlight">child</span> must stay on one of the substitutes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I am making is that the parents of a <span class="highlight">child</span> who must stay on it will be financially embarrassed, and the advisory committee admitted that sometimes this allergy is permanent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It probably will mean that some children will not be able to continue on the cows’ milk substitutes, although they really should, because of their cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They probably have been prescribed for children of a much older age group than that for which they should be prescribed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly agree with  Senator Baume  that it is possible to prove scientifically in many cases that some children do need a milk substitute and that some do not need a milk substitute; but most of us who practise in this country just are not able to do this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have no facilities to enable us to work out whether a <span class="highlight">child</span> needs these substitutes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly most of the evidence is anecdotal and I agree that that is not very scientific; but it will be very difficult to prove to me, to other people in general practice in isolated areas and to the parents of the children with asthma and in more usual cases with abdominal conditions and eczema whom we see improve so much after they go on to cows’ milk substitutes that this is not effective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the evidence is not scientific and is not based on all sorts of scientific tests, the effect of putting these children back on milk at five, six, seven or eight years of age is sometimes quite dramatic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember that  Senator Walters  said something about the need for an increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to enable women to stay at home, if they so choose, to look after their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly is not being applied in that context to women who are pursuing a specific job- this is, the role of homemaker and the role of <span class="highlight">child</span> raiser. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She is giving some <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Walsh has made a suggestion relating to increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The level of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment support these days is ludicrous, quite ludicrous! <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I am one of those who do not believe that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment should be an extraordinarily high payment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a tremendous risk to the low income family in a very high level of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, 1 believe that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments should be increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will a similar increase be made to the present allowance of $7.50 for each <span class="highlight">child</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gives the best counselling for an accused, which I suppose is the duty of a legal aid service, but there was nobody in the Aboriginal Legal Aid Service who offered any assistance to the girl who was violently raped- which possibly resulted in her death- or made any provision for her young <span class="highlight">child</span>, the <span class="highlight">child</span> of the de facto relationship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, if there was negligence on anyone’s part that <span class="highlight">child</span> could well have a claim for compensation for the loss of her mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the case of a 37-year old boilermaker with a wife and one <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He told the story about his <span class="highlight">child</span> wanting to go to the toilet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was from many tragic experiences where women involuntarily were subjected by visiting specialists to forms of birth control that were totally alien to their values of family and <span class="highlight">child</span> rearing and <span class="highlight">child</span> bearing that opposition to Western-type population control grew to the extent that there was a massive political rejection of these programs at the Romanian conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The argument is that couples have deferred the birth of their first <span class="highlight">child</span> for several years, perhaps in response to economic circumstances or to changed attitudes towards women working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What this argument overlooks is the long-standing decline in completed family size in Australia from an average of over 6 children in the 1 880s to about three in the 1 940s and to below three more recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that a thorough investigation of the system of capitalisation of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for home deposits be entered into. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If my <span class="highlight">child</span> was handicapped it would make a difference, although because I am the wife of another taxpayer it is likely that he would be treated in the same way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These women are not allowed to claim such things as <span class="highlight">child</span> day care charges or after school care charges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I had a <span class="highlight">child</span> about to embark on a law course in Victoria or, as I gather from interjections, in other States, I certainly would have grave doubts that it would be prudent to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He asks that consideration be given to increasing <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many working wives, mothers of young children, were reluctant members or the work force, because of economic pressures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their income was often small, after paying <span class="highlight">child</span> care fees, tax and the cost of fares or a second car. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I leave aside several important issues dealt with in the statement, such as <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities and taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, the suggestion from  Dr Hughes  was that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for a family with 3 children should be increased to $30 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That amount of $750m does not take into account the fact that if <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments were taxable, there would be some clawback from the Government’s point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I contrast that sum of $750m with the present sum of about $258m which is provided for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures show that, whilst it may be desirable to talk about providing a wider range of choice to enable women to remain in the home, the cost of increasing <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to the extent suggested would have those economic consequences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To a person who has been brought up in a society where <span class="highlight">child</span> labour is not permitted, the <span class="highlight">child</span> labour situation was most disturbing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned very briefly a little while ago the subject of <span class="highlight">child</span> labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a lot of <span class="highlight">child</span> labour in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was from many tragic experiences where women involuntarily were subjected by visiting specialists to forms of birth control that were totally alien to their values of family and <span class="highlight">child</span> rearing and <span class="highlight">child</span> bearing that opposition to Western-type population control grew to the extent that there was a massive political rejection of these programs at the Romanian conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the case of a Class ‘A’ widow, or a supporting mother, the maximum rate of pension plus the appropriate mother’s allowance and additional pension for children, are affected when the woman’s means as assessed exceed the allowable sum of $1,040. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The applicable maximum rate of pension (including mother’s allowance and additional pension for a <span class="highlight">child</span> or children) is reduced by half of the amount of any means as assessed in excess of $1,040. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 17 March  (Hansard  page 536),  Senator Melzer  asked me, as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Matters, a question without notice concerning Commonwealth support for pre-school centres under the Childhood Services Program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Office of the Interim Committee for the Children’s Commission has now provided the following information: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for Social Security: Is it correct that there is a very large number of unutilised places at commercially operated <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it possible to consider some steps to ensure that these unused places are filled to avoid the need for more expensive capital works and to ensure that the funds available provide for the maximum number of children to obtain care in areas where there may already be existing <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities which are commercially operated but not fully utilised? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that a special subsidy is paid in respect of children in special need at government centres? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, can a similar subsidy be provided, on a similar basis, for children who attend or who would thus be able to attend, commercially operated <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres so that these valuable existing facilities are fully utilised? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some figures that were given to me earlier this week show that at present there are approximately 12 000 vacancies in commercially operated <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator said that if the positions in these centres were used it would avoid the necessity for building new centres under the programs that had previously been arranged through the Interim Committee of the Children’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I received a representation from the commercial <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres this week I said that it was a matter that would receive some consideration because I believe that the utilisation of existing facilities may be of assistance to many needy families who otherwise are unable to obtain the use of <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question whether some subsidy may be provided to enable children in need to use commercial <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres is not one on which I have taken a decision or one to which I have given any consideration at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the Australian Capital Territory, I understand that about 30 per cent of places in commercial <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres are presently vacant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One difficulty in this respect is epitomised by the problems faced by migrants when they seek to adopt children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Baume,  who knows Sydney pretty well, understands as I do that one of the greatest bugbears in relation to the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Welfare Department in New South Wales concerns complaints from people about the lack of uniformity among the States with respect to adoption laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person may refer to the manner in which his or her sister was able to adopt a <span class="highlight">child</span> in another State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My question, which is directed to the Minister for Education, concerns the provision of education for the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister encourage State governments to assume responsibility for the education of handicapped children within State schools and, on the recommendation of the Schools Commission, make funds available for this purpose? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It relates to newspaper reports over the weekend on the subject of the Government’s intentions with respect to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that these reports allege that the Government intends either to abolish <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, to means-test it, or to review eligibility depending on the number of children in a family? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the reports that have been printed by the Press with regard to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment are a matter of conjecture on the part of the Press. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement relating to assistance for May school holiday <span class="highlight">child</span> care projects being funded through the Interim Committee of the Children’s Commission has been circulated by the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As all projects are being carried out within the various States and not the Territories, what plans, if any, exist for children in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second group of people who are not well provided for in this Bill are orphaned children, particularly of single parents who were contributors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In both cases the orphans benefit cuts out on children reaching the age of 16 years, unless those children are full-time students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition had hoped that, in drawing up new legislation, the Government would have taken account of the anomaly, which seems to be almost discrimination based on class, whereby orphaned children of 16 years who are fulltime students may continue to draw a pension from their deceased parents’ superannuation but orphaned children of 16 years who go into the work force or, more significantly, wish to take an apprenticeship do not continue to have an entitlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot see any reason why a <span class="highlight">child</span> who is continuing in fulltime education should have more rights than a young person who decides to take an apprenticeship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to the 16-year old orphaned <span class="highlight">child</span> of a single parent, there is the possibility of the <span class="highlight">child</span> being without any support at all unless better provision is made for him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that members of the Government are aware that many single parents, particularly single mothers, are pursuing a Public Service career particularly because it offers job security and therefore security for their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been contacted by single mothers who are concerned that the failure of the legislation to provide benefits for children over 16 years might mean that their own children, if orphaned, would be in a very invidious position, and I hope that the Government will set about rectifying that anomaly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with the honourable senator that in some circumstances a divorced wife- that is, a wife of many years standing who is divorced when moving towards old age- could be disadvantaged by having no claim at all on the superannuation benefit to which she undoubtedly contributed in her years of <span class="highlight">child</span> rearing and housekeeping. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If she has no such ability and if she has dependent children, I would agree with  Senator Walters  that she should not be excluded from having some claim on the pension of her former spouse, a pension to which undoubtedly she has contributed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we were in government we were criticised for allegedly putting too much money into education to ensure that every <span class="highlight">child</span> in this country- government pupil or nongovernment pupil- received the standard of education that the Commission sought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is educationally sound that the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s first language should be the one used to teach literacy skills for the very simple reason that he is fluent in that language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> was not fluent in English. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact, it is amazing how few teachers realised how little English a <span class="highlight">child</span> needed to appreciate what the teacher was trying to say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> learnt to recognise signals rather than listening to the language of the teacher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second step in this process is to develop literacy skills in the vernacular; in other words, to teach the <span class="highlight">child</span> to read in his own language- to give him that complex set of skills that we call reading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I were to define in more explicit terms what I meant by that expression I would seek to do it in simple terms in these ways: The 1973 legislation of the Labor Government recognised the right of every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> to the best possible educational opportunity which a wealthy society such as ours is capable of providing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, it meant the ending of federal funding of per capita grants which made pocket money for the wealthy in Australia and statistics of the children of the poor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, it meant a striving towards decent, basic minimum standards for Australian children, whatever their origins and wherever they might happen to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is based on an understanding of the importance of needs for every <span class="highlight">child</span> and every school in this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what I am concerned about- I referred to it earlier- is that perhaps the Minister listens to strange voices which may try to divert him from what I believe is a very sincere purpose, namely, to see that the program which we introduced and which is concerned with the rights, individuality and freedom of expression of every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> is carried forward and to insist upon and fight for the development of a program which will help to widen the horizons of every <span class="highlight">child</span> in this country and which will help to enhance and enrich our greatest resource. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For one thing, the cost of educating a <span class="highlight">child</span> in the government school system in Tasmania is, because of the size of that State, greater than the cost in any other State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children no longer go to school to learn the 3 Rs, as one honourable senator referred to them yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, when I began teaching some 19 years ago the emphasis was no longer on the 3 Rs; it was placed more on an educational program that would fit the <span class="highlight">child</span> for a place in the then society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The educational system has moved in a better way over the last 19 years to equip the <span class="highlight">child</span> to take his or her place in society and to live a happy and full life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To do this, we have had to front the <span class="highlight">child</span> with a wide range of subjects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we must not forget that as well as learning those skills, there are other skills which the <span class="highlight">child</span> must learn at school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we are still not equipping the <span class="highlight">child</span> for society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, many of our children leave school with no tuition in consumer education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These things aside, it is necessary that certain fundamentals be grasped so that the <span class="highlight">child</span> is fit to take his or her place in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister advise whether early steps are to be taken to form a consultative committee of the Children’s Commission in the Northern Territory, in line with those in the States of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will resources for <span class="highlight">child</span> care services be made available for such a committee in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the formation of a consultative committee in the Northern Territory, I have made representations to the Minister for the Northern Territory,  Mr Adermann,  to confer with me about arrangements to provide opportunities for consultation with Northern Territory voluntary agencies and others who are interested in <span class="highlight">child</span> care matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have also taken steps to allow me, during my visit to Darwin, which will take place later this month, to seek views from interested bodies in Darwin with regard to the provision of <span class="highlight">child</span> care services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true to say that, prior to this Government taking office, no programs for <span class="highlight">child</span> care had been funded in the Northern Territory through the Interim Committee of the Children’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where a male pensioner marries after his retirement, pension shall not, upon the death of the pensioner, be payable to the widow or in respect of any <span class="highlight">child</span> of the marriage’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister assisting the Prime Minister in <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister inform the Senate whether recent reports claiming that the Government is to slash <span class="highlight">child</span> care funds are true? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister say whether the Government will appoint permanent commissioners to the Childrens Commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government any commitment to the thousands of Australian families who desperately need <span class="highlight">child</span> care? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any statements that have been made that the Government proposes to slash <span class="highlight">child</span> care funds are untrue and unfounded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the statement is made on Thursday night I will be in a position to reveal the expected level of funding for the forthcoming year and I assure the honourable senator that the funds will be adequate to enable the development of a <span class="highlight">child</span> care program and the support of children’s services which we consider essential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the appointment of commissioners to the Childrens Commission, as proposed by the former Government, we are awaiting the report of the Administrative Review Committee under  Sir Henry  Bland and no statements will be made about administration prior to the receipt of that report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No public <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres exist in Belconnen, however, the planning of two public <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres is being considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> Endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres it received $100,000, and for urban and local roads it received $228,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The broad effect of these changes will be to increase the weekly level of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment paid to families by between $3 and $4 per <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the weekly equivalent of the present maximum taxation rebate is $3.85 in respect of most children, the overall position of families able to take full advantage of these rebates at present will not be greatly changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are, however, about 800 000 children in low income families which pay little or no taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These include the children of widow and invalid pensioners, of workers close to the minimum wage or in intermittent employment, of self-employed people unable to earn an adequate income, and of many Aborigines, recently arrived migrants and other disadvantaged groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those families and the children of those families I am sure will remember tonight for 2 particular reasons- our attitude and that of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> endowment will continue to be paid, as it always has been, usually to the mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The full year cost of taxation rebates for dependent children and students, had they been indexed in 1976-77, together with the cost of the present <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment scheme, would have amounted to about $l.,025m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are, of course, associated matters, such as wages policies, Medibank levies, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and various rebates which will no longer apply under the taxation system, to which my colleagues will address themselves individually during the course of the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a person cannot afford to give his <span class="highlight">child</span> the education that he feels his <span class="highlight">child</span> should have, is that <span class="highlight">child</span> to be deprived of that education? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see the increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, which we do not oppose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It ill becomes a senator such as  Senator Martin  to criticise the Labor Government because we did not do more about <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, when the pack of hounds with which we had to contend in our 3 years of office always criticised any activity which we initiated to bring about a better allocation of resources in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, it ill becomes a senator to suggest that because we did not pick up the tab in respect of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment we should be criticised, as  Senator Martin  suggested this evening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst we can personally and politically applaud the increases in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, we have to draw attention to the fact that with removal of the tax deductibility for children this does not achieve the very objective which the Government said it sought to achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear to me, for example, that a person with 10 children in receipt of average weekly earnings, who would benefit greatly from the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments, would lose more than he would gain under this new package deal because of the loss of the tax deductions to which he was formally entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After we get over the first few weeks of excitement or euphoria or whatever we like to call it- particularly in relation to tax indexation and increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment- we will find that consumers have not been stimulated into spending their money and that unemployment has increased with the massive cutbacks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> endowment and tax indexation in themselves are largely illusory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The free bus service for school children will be cut out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we to presume from this that parents are to use their new <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to send their children to school by taxi? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the measure to increase <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question which is directed to the Minister for Social Security relates to the new <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they will be, has the Minister yet been able to calculate whether this will lead to cases where women in receipt of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment will actually lose a supporting mothers benefit or the training allowance currently being paid? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct my question to the Minister for Social Security and refer to recent Press reports suggesting that the Government might plan to reduce spending on <span class="highlight">child</span> care services next year by $5.8m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Will the Government in fact reduce financial support for <span class="highlight">child</span> care services in 1976-77 compared with the current financial year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will action be taken, in accordance with the Government’s intention to improve services to the most needy in the community, to meet this criterion with respect to <span class="highlight">child</span> care services? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I noticed Press reports of a reduction of some $5.8m in the <span class="highlight">child</span> care program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some $227,000 was spent on <span class="highlight">child</span> care in the year 1972-73; the following year $8.6m was spent; in 1974-75 $44.86m was spent; and in 1975-76 $63.29m will be spent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister has already announced that funding for <span class="highlight">child</span> care services this year will be given a priority because of the very urgent need in most parts of Australia for these support services for families and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, I do not have time to go into the detail of what is involved in the area of assistance to families but I will refer to statements made by the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  relating to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> endowment has been increased to $3.50 for the first <span class="highlight">child</span>, going up progressively to $7 for the fifth <span class="highlight">child</span> and subsequent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a great increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment but more important than that is the fact that it will be a non-taxable family allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, the taxation rebates for dependent children which were allowed in the past are going to be abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in the area of social services there will be a greater levelling out and a greater benefit, with <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments being non-taxable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That will give far greater assistance to poorer families, particularly as the endowment has been increased significantly, while at the same time the dependent children’s allowance for taxation purposes has been abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another interesting point which the previous  speaker  made was the extraordinary statement that we are suddenly going to have non-taxable <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be very interested to hear when <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment in this country was ever taxable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the new <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the gains that people will receive from the introduction of this <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment scheme and from the introduction of tax indexation will be lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I noticed on my desk today, with the compliments of  Senator Cotton,  a set of tables which show the effect on taxpayers of the new proposals for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and tax indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The introduction of the Medibank levy or the forcing of people into private insurance has, in many cases, cancelled the good effects of the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment proposals and the good effects of tax indexation which was praised so much a moment ago by  Senator Young. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People on the average income and thereabouts and even the poor people who receive some cash benefits from the new <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment scheme and, in some cases, from tax indexation will be further affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the cuts which will affect these people is the cut in the <span class="highlight">child</span> care programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The needs of the impoverished people, especially the single parent units, are needs not only for cash but also for services- needs for all sorts of <span class="highlight">child</span> care services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that a lot of these <span class="highlight">child</span> care services and <span class="highlight">child</span> care programs will not go ahead will eat into the benefits that are received because in many cases these people will have to pay for the provision of those facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these cases any benefits received from the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment proposals and any benefits received from tax indexation are wiped out straight away by the Medibank levy or, in the case of many of them, by the need to insure privately with the voluntary health funds, as many of them wish to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generally the unit consists of parents and one or two children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have a great need for the provision of sewerage, road works, hospitals, community health centres and <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities in general. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They accept with great equanimity the fact that in the Treasurer’s statement <span class="highlight">child</span> care expenditure has been cut and that expenditure on other facilities has been cut. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have devised a system in which we are now able to give to every <span class="highlight">child</span> in this country the same measure of support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recognised that there were about 800 000 children in these families and realised that the whole system of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment needed to be restructured so that assistance could be directed to all children and to all families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of some families being able to take advantage of a $200 rebate for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> and a rebate for other children, the same allowances will be made for all children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were influenced in this decision very strongly by the poverty report of Professor Henderson which talked of the way in which we could direct assistance to families by abolishing tax rebates, thus enabling a larger amount to be distributed amongst the children in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the first, second and third <span class="highlight">child</span> we have given a greater allowance than was recommended by Professor Henderson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps at this stage we have not accepted the level of allowances which was recommended by his report for the fourth <span class="highlight">child</span> and subsequent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were influenced by the figures relating to families which have one to three children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of children in families which have one <span class="highlight">child</span> totals 668 000; in families with 2 children, 730 000; and in families with 3 children, 352 000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This makes a total of 1.7 million children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of children in families with four or more children total 1 74 000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We realised that 1.7 million children would benefit from the greatly increased allowances we gave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also gave heavy increases to those families with four or more children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new allowances are $3.50 a week for the first <span class="highlight">child</span>, $5 for the second <span class="highlight">child</span>, $6 for the third <span class="highlight">child</span>, $6 for the fourth <span class="highlight">child</span> and $7 for each <span class="highlight">child</span> thereafter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Significantly too we have been enabled to introduce a greater benefit for student children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In future they will be treated on the same basis as other children in the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas at present endowment for a student <span class="highlight">child</span> is $ 1 .50 a week, in future it will range from $3.50 to $7 a week depending on the position of the <span class="highlight">child</span> in the family and the number of children in the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In future the endowment allowance for student children will continue until 25 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We took the opportunity also to adjust some provisions with regard to nationality qualifications to give effect to certain children with alien fathers who were excluded from eligibility for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is important to me and to my department is that the new benefit will be a help to those families where there is a single breadwinner or perhaps where there is a single parent looking after children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will have support in a way which will enable them to determine how they will meet the needs of their children and to decide the priorities which they will give to this expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as it seeks to assist poorer sections in the community and to make increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments- carried out on the recommendation of the Henderson report- the statement is also welcomed by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other assault which has been made by this Government is on <span class="highlight">child</span> care, something which goes to the very heart of our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Something of the greatest importance to developing a proper Australia is provision for the care of the children of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision of increased <span class="highlight">child</span> allowances will effectively redistribute income to the areas of greatest need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt the emphasis on <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and the social justice which it brings is an excellent beginning to asking others to bear some cost which is needed to relate Australia’s economic costs to those of its trading partners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface my question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer by saying that yesterday we heard the Minister for Social Security indicate that the Government was examining monthly payments of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment because the Government felt the money should be put in the hands of those to whom it belonged as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allowance will, however, be made for increased dependants rebates and zone allowance, where they are relevant, and the <span class="highlight">child</span> dependant allowances that are to be abolished will not be allowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1  have spoken elsewhere of the Government’s proposals for an improved scheme of family allowances and pointed out the reasons for the consequential removal of the rebates for maintenance of children from the income tax law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this Bill it is proposed to increase payments to $3.50 a week for the first <span class="highlight">child</span>, $5.00 a week for the second <span class="highlight">child</span>, $6.00 a week for the third and fourth children and $7.00 a week for each other <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another significant change proposed is that students will be brought into account in the assessment of the total amount of family allowance payable, as if they were children under 16 years of age, and the rate payable for them will be determined according to their position in a family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>$1.50 a week flat, will be increased to a minimum of $3.50 for the eldest or only <span class="highlight">child</span> in the family; if there are two student children in the family the rate payable for the second student will be $5.00 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will overcome the existing anomaly that, upon a <span class="highlight">child</span> reaching 16 years and becoming a student, the total amount payable increases in one and two <span class="highlight">child</span> families but decreases in families where there are more than two children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Most families receive assistance for children under 16 years of age and students by way of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and personal income tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the benefits that are available to some taxpayers by way of tax rebates for children do not apply to some 300 000 families whose incomes are insufficient to enable them to take advantage of those tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The increases in family allowances will take effect at virtually the same time as the payasyouearn schedules of tax instalments are adjusted to take account of the withdrawal of rebates for children and students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The new proposals will increase the annual cost of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment by $785m to $ 1,020m a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This additional cost will be offset by the abolition of taxation rebates for children and students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A <span class="highlight">child</span> of the taxpayer who is aged 1 6 or more but less than 25 and who is a full-time student will be treated as a dependant if his or her income is not above $1073. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, relates to the new and increased family allowances which, following on the existing system of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, will be paid to the mother of the <span class="highlight">child</span> or children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister clarify the position in relation to the payment of the newenefits to the father of the <span class="highlight">child</span> or children where the father has actual and legal custody and maintains the <span class="highlight">child</span> or children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am able to assure the honourable senator that where a father has the care, custody and control of the <span class="highlight">child</span> the payment of this benefit, which is a benefit for the children of Australia, will be made to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where a <span class="highlight">child</span> is living with the mother or within the family, the payment will be made to the mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where the mother is not directly related to the care, custody and control of the <span class="highlight">child</span>, the payment will go to the parent who has that responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What action can be taken to remedy the situation where a girl under 16 years of age who becomes pregnant- I understand that under the law a girl of that age is not permitted to marry- and who otherwise would be entitled to a social security benefit of $10 a week as a junior, has the benefit reduced to about $3 a week because her mother is receiving <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for her of in the vicinity of $7 a week? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it would be desirable to clarify accurately the situation of a <span class="highlight">child</span> under sixteen years in the circumstances mentioned by the honourable senator in relation to the payment of the new rates of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment which will take effect shortly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface my question which I direct to the Minister for Industry and Commerce by referring to a question that I asked the Minister on 26 May 1976 in answer to which the Minister directed my attention to figures published by his department on tax indexation, the Medibank levy and increases in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment being introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I asked  Senator Cotton  a question yesterday and he directed my attention to figures published by his Department on the introduction of tax indexation, the Medibank levy and increases in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2) 1976 provides for increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment or family allowance payments to mothers or, in some cases, fathers of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These increases are allegedly being paid for by the removal of tax rebates for children on our present tax scales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I contrast this attitude of the present Opposition with the attitude of some honourable senators opposite when last year we changed the tax deduction for children to a tax rebate system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Along with these measures there needs to be an increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> care and family support services in general as well as an increase in the mother’s and guardian’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He recommended increases of this order in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to relieve poverty in families with children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More has been given to the first, second and third children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Less has been given to the fourth and later children than Professor Henderson recommended if inflation is taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It involves more than the Department of Social Security with its relief, because <span class="highlight">child</span> care, transport, education, housing, health and legal aid are all involved in getting over this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill is allegedly about <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment but of course it is about a lot more than that, as  Senator Grimes  has already indicated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another guaranteed minimum income which we have had in this country for some years has been our <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can argue about quantum, but there is no doubt that there has been provision for the payment of allowances in respect of all children in this country for some time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has emerged is the fact that the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment which is paid may not be effective in achieving what it is meant to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Professor Henderson and his group pointed out that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment or family allowances are more useful to poor families than to wealthy families; that the allowances are more critical in providing the cash resources available to poor families; and that the provision of family allowances is the appropriate way to increase the cash resources of poor families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that a <span class="highlight">child</span> allowance or endowment is paid irrespective of the income of the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that paper it is recommended that there should be an increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment which would make an attack on the problem which is measured and recognised in that paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was  Mr Menzies,  as he then was, who in 1941 introduced <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for the first time, but at that stage it was payable only in respect of second and subsequent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the level of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment was increased, it was not until 1950, when  Mr Menzies  was again Prime Minister and in order to honour an election pledge, that any endowment was introduced in respect of the first <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So again it has been the Liberal and National Country Parties side of politics which not only introduced but also extended <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1964  Mr Menzies’  Government increase the rates of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment in respect of third and subsequent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1967 a government of our persuasion again increased the rates of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, but this time in respect of fourth and subsequent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a further increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment in 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But from 1950 onwards there has been no change in the structure of the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has already been pointed out by  Senator Grimes-  I agree with what he said- that a major recommendation of the Henderson Commission related to alterations in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also recommended the abolition of the concessional tax rebates allowable in respect of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Grimes  also pointed out that we are varying slightly the exact rates of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment which were recommended by the Henderson Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have taken the view that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment will flow to family units. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another important provision in this Bill seeks to amend another part of the principal Act to raise the age of a dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> who is a student from 21 years to 25 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the same way as a Liberal government introduced <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and extended that benefit, including the way we are extending it now, which has not previously been done, I hope that this is just the first of numerous measures which our Government will introduce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only presume that unless in some way the Government will provide me with <span class="highlight">child</span> care services, which would include facilities to enable a housekeeper to live in, I will still be penalised under the existing Income Tax Assessment Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I question how many people will be advantaged now that <span class="highlight">child</span> rebates have been withdrawn from income tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have looked through this extremely complex document entitled: ‘Indexation, <span class="highlight">Child</span> Rebate and <span class="highlight">Child</span> Endowment Changes 1976-77 Rates <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, the national average of children in a family is 2.7 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can never understand how a family can have seven-tenths of a <span class="highlight">child</span>; so I will take the case of a taxpayer with a dependent wife and 2 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If such a taxpayer has a weekly income of $80 a week, which is a low income, the net gain from tax and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment changes will be $7. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if the taxpayer happens to be earning $400 a week and has the same dependent wife and 2 children, he will gain $10.95. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the tax indexation and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  say that in actual fact when a father was supporting children and established that this was the case, he would receive <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a single father has 2 dependent children he will not benefit by the same amount as a person who is on a higher income with 2 dependent children; nor will he benefit as much as a person on a lower income with 2 dependant children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention next those people who will feel the effect of the $ 15m cut to <span class="highlight">child</span> care, the arts and other programs administered by the Prime Minister and Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the cutback in roads, in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, in kindargartens and all of those amentities which are now being discontinued under this Government’s plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It relates to children under school leaving age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister believe that the payment of $3.50 a week to the mother of the mother-to-be will compensate her for what she will need to provide for the coming <span class="highlight">child</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier when touching on this matter very briefly, nothing has been done for single or supporting fathers except that now the Minister has said that payments will be made directly to them if they can establish that they are supporting a <span class="highlight">child</span> or children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned that this Government or any previous government has not done anything to enable a deserted husband, or the father of dependent children, to be able to cope more adequately with a situation that leaves a lot to be desired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know of a case where a relatively young man, an unskilled labourer on approximately $100 a week clear, has been left with 3 children, two under school age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is now seriously contemplating leaving his position and becoming unemployed so that he can afford to stay at home and look after his children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He may not be able to afford to eat, but he will be able to afford to stay home and look after his children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is nothing in any of the Bills which have come before the Senate from this Government which has made provision for a man in such a position to be able to employ a housekeeper and to pay a housekeeper to live in and to look after his children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the recommendations, of course, was that there be an increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>See what you can do with it to feed, clothe and educate the children’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous amounts that were paid in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment were only very small. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at the scale one sees that a family with one <span class="highlight">child</span> will receive $3.50 a week and that the amount received by a family with 2 children jumps up to $8.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They know that they will be able to use the money as they see fit to buy clothes and text books for their children and to do all of those things that they have always felt that they would like to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should have thought that the people who have been so concerned with women’s rights and the role of women in society, as  Senator Baume  has been, would have remembered the supporting mothers’ benefit which the Labor Government introduced and which for the first time gave mothers a real chance to choose between staying at home and looking after their children or parking them somewhere and going out to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hardly think that an increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment is in any way in the same class as the introduction of the supporting mothers’ benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Think of the <span class="highlight">child</span> care services that should be given so that young mothers going to hospitals to have their new babies can go with some peace of mind rather than wondering how on earth they are going to manage while they are in hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Think of people in the outer suburbs of the large cities of this country who in this day and age when we can put a man on the moon do not have sewerage connected to their homes and have to worry about all the things that worry young mothers with small children when they do not have sewerage systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As honourable senators may remember, a large part of my maiden speech was devoted to the need for a large increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Federal governments have supported working mothers by providing subsidised <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres and maternity and paternity leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Many mothers who bring up their children in the home have stopped and wondered if they could really afford to do what they have always wanted to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Many women present claimed that, given a real choice, they would much prefer to stay at home with their children but that up to date a real choice had not existed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the first time since 1 94 1 , when  Mr Menzies  brought in the original <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, that any government has given serious thought to the mother in the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard criticism of this scheme by those who are objecting to the fact that the <span class="highlight">child</span> rebate will no longer be an allowance against the father’s tax and that the mother is now the one who has the money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, the first Government to bring in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment was the Liberal Government of 1941. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will bring substantial increases to the incomes of 300 000 low income familiesSenator Melzer wondered whether they existwith 800 000 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A family with one <span class="highlight">child</span> will receive $14 a month; with 2 children $34 a month; with 3 children $58 a month; with 4 children $82 a month, and with 5 children $110 a month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, the payment is normally made to the mother, but in the case of separation it will go to the parent who has custody of the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security and relates to the new arrangements whereby an office of <span class="highlight">child</span> care has been substituted for the Interim Committee of the Children’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister whether this office will administer and fund only <span class="highlight">child</span> care or whether it will also comprehend, as did the Interim Committee, other children’s services such as toy libraries, services for handicapped children, pre-school centres and activities centres for before and after school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The office of <span class="highlight">child</span> care will deal with the development of children’s services throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hoped that more emphasis can be placed on the development of <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities, in particular those which are required urgently for the children of sole parents, invalid parents, or other groups who urgently require the provision of services for children in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the new arrangements that have put <span class="highlight">child</span> care under the control of the Department of Social Security, can the Minister indicate the role that will be played by the State consultative committees which worked with the Interim Committee for the Children’s Commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Martin states that ‘<span class="highlight">child</span> endowment is the best means of channelling assistance while avoiding problems of take-up and stigma’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill simply increases the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payment to a higher level which is more in keeping with the cost of living these days than was the old <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, by its very nature <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment will benefit only women who are dependent on their husband’s income or on a government benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not criticising this measure but I am criticising the claim that this improvement in the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payment, by itself, constitutes some sort of independence for women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as most working women have children and are therefore aware of the needs of families, particularly poor families, and are happy to support an increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, so I think we should encourage women who are at present at home with their children to think in terms of supporting policies for women who need or wish to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not read the findings of this Committee but I recommend the report, particularly to those members of the Government who may be tempted to feel that the Government has done enough for women by increasing the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the most important thing done by the Labor Government in relation to giving women real choice and independence was the formulation of a national <span class="highlight">child</span> care program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was a radical departure from what had been the attitude of previous governments towards the care and education of young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was quite amazed last night to hear  Senator Baume,  speaking for the Government, claim that this Bill, which increases <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments, represented some sort of radical program for a genuine redistribution of wealth throughout the community, that it was innovative and that nothing like this had ever been done for women or families before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The setting up of a national <span class="highlight">child</span> care program, which I am pleased to see this Government will continue in some way, was much more radical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have pointed out that, by offering $8.50 to a woman with 2 children and a little more to a woman with 3 children, the Government really is not offering something comparable to a wage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could have gained the impression, from listening to some of the speakers last night, that this <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment provision was intended to be some sort of mother’s wage on the cheap. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to look for some sort of financial recognition of the productivity of the woman in the home, I hope that it would measure something more than $8.50 for the work involved in caring for 2 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am a little worried, and some of the students who were lobbying here last night in respect of the tertiary allowances were worried, that by extending, in terms of the definition, the period of childhood to 25 years for the purpose of allowing a mother to claim the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment benefit the legislation may be jeopardising the possibility of those students gaining full living away from home allowances or full tertiary education allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other suggestion that has been made in respect of this <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment provision is that somehow or other it is achieving the objective of a guaranteed minimum income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard quite a lot of quotations from the relevant Henderson reports on poor families and quite a lot of references to the fact that the Government now is adopting Professor Henderson’s recommendations in respect of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were a number of recommendations, of which that for increases in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment- that is, increases in cash payments to poor families- was only one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding of the overall views of the Henderson report with respect to a guaranteed minimum income was that increased cash payments to families by way of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments would be only one of the steps necessary to establish a guaranteed minimum income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, with the $ 10 or even $20 a week that a mother will receive by way of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, she cannot buy good education for her children; she cannot purchase housing; she cannot get access to community facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although we all acknowledge that an advance has been made in respect of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments, we on this side ofthe chamber recognise that it is a very small advance and that there are many more actions that a responsible government can take if it is genuine about improving opportunities in life for poor families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is that the previous  speaker  referred to the question of discrimination, and the other is to point out to the Senate a little bit of the history of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no specific training available to mothers, yet to become a competent mother I have found it necessary to study <span class="highlight">child</span> psychology and education, elementary nursing and human physiology, cookery and nutrition, general housekeeping and domestic economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As my children grow and their needs change, so I have to acquire the additional skills to fulfill those needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One ofthe conclusions reached by a Seminar on Creche ‘s and Day Nurseries organised by the International Children’s Centre in Paris ( 1 960) was that: ‘The greatest obstacle to the expansion of <span class="highlight">child</span>-care services of all kinds . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After training up to required standards, the grant of nationally recognised certificates of qualification is often helpful not only as a proof of ability and competence but also m establishing the status of those engaged in <span class="highlight">child</span>-care work in the skilled and technical levels’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is ironical that whilst the need for trained staff to man creches and <span class="highlight">child</span>-care centres is recognised, the need for vocational and in-service training for mothers is ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet mothers, whose concern for the welfare of their children is a professional, long-term commitment more deeply felt than that of an employee, have a far greater need for educational and training services to equip them for their job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The traditions of <span class="highlight">child</span>-care and domestic management formerly passed on within the security of an extended family circle are now frequently entirely lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With increasing evidence that ‘equality of opportunity’ rests in the first instance with equality of mother-care (for which no satisfactory substitute has yet been found) it seems incredible that millions of dollars are being poured into the expansion of schools and other institutional <span class="highlight">child</span>-care programs which have been shown to be of doubtful value (see Karmel Report’: Schools in Australia) whilst the fundamental step required to make these agencies more effective is ignored; namely, the up-grading of the status of motherhood and the funding of vocational and educational programs for mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Government will give serious consideration to making a statement now, or at least in the not too distant future, that the new amounts of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment will be the subject of indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I take the opportunity of saying to the Senate that I have had long experience of and interest in the subject of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But even before I had a family I was, both on the Social Welfare Committee of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and on the ACTU Executive itself, in the forefront of the campaign to have <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Albert Monk was a man who, when asked 6 months before he retired from the presidency of the ACTU what he would like to be done in the social welfare area and what would be his priority, said an increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The women of Australia owe it not only to Jack Lang but also to Albert Monk in his negotiations with the then Federal Government that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments are made directly to mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The total amount involved in this case of $10 still will be paid, but there will be a difference in the amount that is deducted because of the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This investigation, which was conducted jointly by the Depanment of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Health and the Audiology Section of the Speech Therapy Department, Queensland University, resulted in the development of a Hearing Conservation and Treatment Program for Aboriginals, funds for which were and still are provided by the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-66-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a view that the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act 1972 does not adequately meet all the needs for early childhood services in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister indicate whether new legislation may be brought down to replace those parts of the Children’s Commission Act relating to children’s services in this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the proposed Children’s Commission has now been transferred to the Department of Social Security and as we are anxious to develop services for children, we will be looking to whatever needs there are for legislation to enable a very comprehensive service to be developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is found that the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act is inappropriate or inadequate steps will be taken to have the required legislation for the <span class="highlight">child</span> care services to be developed through the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the announcement of new arrangements related to <span class="highlight">child</span> care, some community groups have expressed concern that the situation in relation to adolescents may continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that in 1972 the Liberal/Country Party Government commissioned, with the support of the State Ministers responsible for <span class="highlight">child</span> and social welfare, a family research project within the University of New South Wales to undertake a series of studies directed towards understanding and documenting family disruption and breakdown and changing family patterns in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the decision that, in the case of custody of children, the Act was valid only to the extent that it applied to proceedings between the parties to a marriage for the custody of the natural or adopted children of both of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that disputes between one party to a marriage and, say, a grandparent of a <span class="highlight">child</span> of the marriage would fall outside the jurisdiction of the Act and would therefore have to be resolved according to relevant State law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Likewise disputes between a husband and wife over a stepchild would be outside the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the areas of maintenance and injunctions, the definition has been confined to proceedings between the parties and, in the case of maintenance of a <span class="highlight">child</span>, to proceedings by or on behalf of a <span class="highlight">child</span> against one or both parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The expression <span class="highlight">child</span> of a marriage has been limited to the natural or adopted children of both parties to the marriage, although the existing, wider meaning has been retained for the purposes of section 63- which prevents a divorce becoming absolute unless the court is satisfied as to the welfare of children of the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One amendment will enable an authority or officer of the Commonwealth or a State to take proceedings to obtain a maintenance order on behalf of a party or <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Doubts have been raised as to the extent of these powers, and the amendments spell out the powers under a court order that may be exercised, where necessary, to search places and to use force to take possession of a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two amendments in the <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare area have been included in the Bill at the request of the former New South Wales Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of these ensures that a <span class="highlight">child</span> who is under the guardianship of a State or Territory Director of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Welfare while awaiting adoption cannot be the subject of a maintenance or custody order except in special circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present the Act confines this exemption to children who are under the care and control of a Minister pursuant to State or Territory <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other amendment would take away the jurisdiction that a court now has under the Act to order the continuance of a custody or access order relating to a <span class="highlight">child</span> after the <span class="highlight">child</span> has been adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 23 June  His Excellency  the GovernorGeneral agreed to a change in the Administrative Arrangements Order which placed the responsibilities for <span class="highlight">child</span> care matters under the Minister for Social Security,  Senator Margaret  Guilfoyle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Matters, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Will the Minister clarify the way in which Government assistance is to be provided in respect of <span class="highlight">child</span> care, as a result of the possible change forecast in this area in the ‘minibudget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government does alter the criteria applicable to the provision of financial assistance to <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, will it ensure that those parents who have entered into financial commitments and paid fees in good faith are not penalised or disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3m would be available for children’s services in 1976-77. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister has announced that in the coming financial year priority will be given to funding <span class="highlight">child</span> care projects in high need areas and that ways of meeting this priority within the level of funds provided will be examined during discussions with the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That pre-school education is the right of every <span class="highlight">child</span>, irrespective of financial circumstances; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We therefore urge that the cuts already made in the budget of the Children’s Commission be restored and no further cuts be made in children’s services, i.e. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>full day care, occassional day care, sessional pre-schools, family day care, residential care, play groups, parent education programs, holiday programs, toy libraries, mobile pre-school units and any other areas concerned with the total development of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be understood that the proposed children’s commission of the former Government has now become the office of <span class="highlight">child</span> care within the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 2 ways in which funds have been dealt with through the office of <span class="highlight">child</span> care- firstly, through the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act of 1972, and secondly, by means of the arrangement that was made by the Whitlam Government with respect to a 75 per cent level of funding for pre-school salaries provided those pre-schools developed other services which were appropriate to the needs of the communities in which they were operating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope to be able in the very near future to announce what the programs will be within the office of <span class="highlight">child</span> care to use the $74m that has been appropriated under the Budget this year for those purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This article requires that the parents ‘bring up their children in the spirit of moral law of the builders of Communism’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Article 59-64 regulates the order which enables to deprive the parents of the custody right and take from them the <span class="highlight">child</span>, partly in connection with non-compliance with above mentioned obligations, which is in stark contrast with the text of the Final Act and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be understood that under the previous <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment scheme payments could be made in 3 ways to those who had entitlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Families which receive the allowance for children received the first cheques on 13 July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, what the Budget papers do not disclose in that column is that in the past year there has been a transfer of <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education from the Department, which funded that program in the first half of last year to the extent of some $10m, to the Schools Commission program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am able to tell the Senate that the program as recommended by the Schools Commission for <span class="highlight">child</span> migrants in the document which was tabled yesterday, I think envisages some $2 1.6m as a recommendation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition there is provision in the Department’s estimates in relation to the <span class="highlight">child</span> program which amounts to $691,000 for the provision of materials, conferences, special arrangements for refugee children and the Australian Council for Educational Research test development project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taken overall, the position is that a substantial amount of money will be made available by the Government to migrant education, particularly for the <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What measures are being considered to provide equity to ensure that persons providing services without pay in the communityespecially housewives providing <span class="highlight">child</span> carehave the right to the long term security of knowing that their children will not be disadvantaged should they be injured or sick? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface my question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, by reminding the Minister that in response to 2 written questions on notice, neither of which was directed to her, I was informed that <span class="highlight">child</span> abuse is almost unknown, officially at least, in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, these being the 2 parts of Australia for which direct Commonwealth responsibility exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister would probably agree that any assessment suggesting that <span class="highlight">child</span> abuse is rare is likely to be an under-assessment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has announced also that the new Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care will include within its ambit projects in connection with the prevention of <span class="highlight">child</span> abuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore ask the Minister: Will special attention be given to the education of those departments and officials in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory who apparently either do not know of <span class="highlight">child</span> abuse or else do not understand the need for proper community monitoring to detect the true incidence of the abuse by adults of defenceless children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with the honourable senator when he suggests that it is virtually impossible to obtain accurate figures on the incidence of <span class="highlight">child</span> abuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore do feel that any figures that have ever been quoted on the incidence of <span class="highlight">child</span> abuse are likely to be an underassessment of the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year funding was provided by the Commonwealth Government for a conference which related to the battered <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This brought to Australia some United Kingdom experts who were interested in the treatment of <span class="highlight">child</span> abuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care, of course, has programs that give assistance to parents and children and which would act towards the prevention of situations which might lead to <span class="highlight">child</span> abuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sorts of services that can be funded, such as emergency care and services for the provision of accommodation for those who require it, may alleviate some of the battered children problems we have seen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Programs which might be of assistance in educating the whole community in relation to <span class="highlight">child</span> abuse certainly would have support in any funding that the Government was able to direct to them, and I believe that officials in departments would benefit from any of the activities that might be undertaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The additional weekly supplement for a dependent wife will be increased from $15.00 to $21.00 and that for each dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> from $7.00 to $10.00. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The weekly payment in respect of each dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> of a deceased seaman will be increased from $7.00 to $10.00 and the maximum payable in respect of funeral costs will be increased from $450 to $650. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission brought out the report on aged persons housing, it brought out a project report entitled  Children, Parents and Community Emergency Relief,  and the very important discussion papers Nos 1 and 2 which dealt with the Australian Assistance Plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It brought out a paper on the proceedings of a conference on the rights of a <span class="highlight">child</span> and progress reports on the Australian Assistance Plan as well as a paper on income security issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were changed criteria for approvals and changed administrative practices relating to the aged persons housing program and new emphasis was placed on <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was the work of bodies like the Social Welfare Commission which led to the formation of the Children’s Commission and from the Children’s Commission to the new Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Social Welfare Commission, has been offered and has accepted a senior position within the Department of Social Security in charge of the new Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister for Social Security received a telegram from the Labor Council of New South Wales regretting that in 1975-76, 70 per cent of <span class="highlight">child</span> care funds went to centres providing only sessional <span class="highlight">child</span> care? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They pointed to the percentage of funds expended on pre-school education in the past year and expressed the need for development of <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities in the various States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time we have announced that through the Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care within the Department we are looking to developing some <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities which will cover the needs of those persons mentioned by the honourable senator in his question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the Government’s decision to increase the rate of the handicapped children’s benefit as announced by the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  in his Budget Speech of 17 August 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will be aware that the handicapped children’s benefit was first introduced in 1968 under the National Health Act 1953-1968 and was incorporated in the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974 when the Act was passed in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The handicapped children’s benefit is payable to an eligible voluntary, religious or charitable organisation, or local governing body, which provides approved residential accommodation for handicapped children who are engaged in training programs The Bill provides for the rate of this benefit in respect of each physically or mentally handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 years of age to be increased from $3.50 a day to $5 a day with effect from 1 November 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Currently, the benefit is payable to 86 homes in respect of 1400 handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Senate is aware the Government has also decided to increase the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance from $ 10 a week to $ 1 5 a week, which is payable under the Social Services Act 1947-1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that it was our side of politics that introduced <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I ask the Minister for Social Security: Has the Government made a decision to transfer all the pre-school functions and funding from the Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care to the Department of Education? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister sought or received advice from State consultative committees on <span class="highlight">child</span> care and from concerned voluntary groups and other interested groups on the implications of separating pre-school services from other children’s services funded by the Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care in the Department of Social Security is at present administering all the programs previously handled by the Interim Committee of the Children’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has announced that it will continue the previous Government’s basis of pre-school funding until the end of this year, despite the fact that only a small number of pre-schools have fulfilled the condition that they provide extended and integrated services with <span class="highlight">child</span> care and other services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to advice from State consultative committees and other groups concerning the separation of <span class="highlight">child</span> care from pre-school education, I am not aware of any recent advice along those lines because no such advice has been requested from State consultative committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care and its functions are under examination at present and an appropriate announcement will be made when the investigations are concluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I had further indicated the dramatic measure of change which was relevant to the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment policies and which must increase the stability and security of the family unit in the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Since the last Budget the responsibility for reimbursing the States for moneys spent on <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education has been transferred from the Department of Education to the Schools Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1975-76 an amount of $ 10.3m was spent by the department on <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to these amounts the Department of Education has also estimated expenditure in 1976- 77 of $691,000 on <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education to be spent on the production of material, conferences, special arrangements for refugee children and a language test development project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Services are falling well below standard in the areas of family welfare, <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare, rehabilitation and parole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have the shocking situation that a parent still has to have his <span class="highlight">child</span> arrested and charged under the Mental Defectives Ordinance before assistance can be given to the <span class="highlight">child</span> to travel interstate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the 1976-77 Budget allocation of $73.3 million for <span class="highlight">child</span> care amounts to less than $23 per <span class="highlight">child</span> per year which is totally inadequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present government <span class="highlight">child</span> care programs are heavily biassed in favour or pre-school programs, 70 per cent of the funds being destined for pre-schools which only provide part-time services for children and do not cater for the needs of working parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For single parent families, or families where one parent is an invalid, we will introduce a special <span class="highlight">child</span> care rebate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In response to the question I can say only that the Government is aware of the needs of one-parent families for emergency funding, income and benefits including <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities and other supportive services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply wish to say that at present we are considering the funding arrangements for next year and, as has been previously announced by the Government, we wish to give some accent to the development of <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As early as possible- I hope quite soon- an announcement will be made with regard to future arrangements for the services for children through the Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Positive consideration of such matters as <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and basic education costs (fares, books, clothes) need attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another great disappointment in the Budget concerns the pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> care area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that  Senator Guilfoyle,  who is the Minister in charge of <span class="highlight">child</span> care matters, has repeatedly assured this chamber that her Government will turn its attention to the needs of very young children and that there would be an allocation on the basis of need, what do we find? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, there is no assurance that that $73.3m which is allocated will go specifically for <span class="highlight">child</span> care programs for those most in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government leaves this matter to the States, we know that the States will have a number of alternatives of which just one will be to provide <span class="highlight">child</span> care programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have an unspecified inquiry into <span class="highlight">child</span> care to see where it should be in the spectrum of government bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> endowment is of much more value to the poor and is a more equitable form of payment compared with taxation deductions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>State run accommodation for children placed in care because mothers cannot support them is $100 per week per <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said also that they received $6 for each <span class="highlight">child</span> under the age of six. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That figure, of course, should be $15 for each <span class="highlight">child</span> under the age of six. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I went on to say that once the <span class="highlight">child</span> goes to school he loses that $6 benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said further that a supporting mother keeps the $6 benefit until the <span class="highlight">child</span> turns sixteen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I should like to place again on record that I believe that my colleagues have destroyed the claims of honourable senators opposite that this Liberal and National Country Party Government was capable of managing the economy of this great country to the extent where every Australian man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> would have a fair share of the wealth of the nation; that this Government would create full employment; and that it would cure inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the Capital Territory, refers to a situation which has arisen in the Australian Capital Territory this week as a result of the Government’s new policy of bus passes for school children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Several small children already have been left stranded at bus stops because they did not have bus passes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime will the Minister give bus drivers a clear and direct policy instruction that they are not to leave children without passes stranded at bus stops? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister confirm publicly that financial assistance is available from the Welfare Branch of the Department to parents who are unable to afford the $10 a <span class="highlight">child</span> bus pass fee? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see no reason why any <span class="highlight">child</span> should be put off a bus in this early stage of the new system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The second was that in certain circumstances parents of children who are unable to afford the fee can obtain assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recent litigation has thrown some doubt on the extent of the provision enabling a court, in special circumstances, to make a maintenance or custody order in respect of a <span class="highlight">child</span> who has been put into care under State welfare legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760921_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Medical investigations are often necessary to determine whether the degree of incapacity of the <span class="highlight">child</span> necessitates the claimant providing the <span class="highlight">child</span> with constant care and attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760921_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-5">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (f) Approximately 16 per cent of claims for double orphan’s pension are found not to justify payment of benefit, while for handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance, the estimate is 13 per cent mainly on the results of medical investigations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760921_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister for Social Security clarify the present position of the Australian Capital Territory Consultative Committee, which was established under the former Children’s Commission, whose functions have now been transferred to the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Office in the Department of Social Security? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there are to be any changes with regard to the activity and manner of working I will make an announcement, but at present the arrangements are as they were established under the proposed Children’s Commissionthat is, that it is an advisory body and will continue to act as such unless we decide that any other manner of working would be of greater advantage to the work that needs to be done by the Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These payments are made to parents caring for handicapped children in their own home and this financial year these people will get a total of nearly $9m . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The abolition of the income tax rebates for dependent children and the substitution of higher <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment has removed the inequity arising from the inability of low income families to take full advantage of the taxation rebates for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is also the fact that very recently the Federal Government did something which the Whitlam Government declined to do; it took the student allowance component of the previous <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment rate which stood, I think, at $1.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761007_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As at 1 September 1976, following the creation of the Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care within the Department of Social Security, the number of such persons employed was eleven (11). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761012_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not necessary for them to be attending school, because the family allowance continues to be paid for student children until they are 25 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This progressive change, when considered in conjunction with the increases in pension rates to take effect from 1 1 November 1976, will mean that a single age or invalid pensioner without a <span class="highlight">child</span> will, regardless of his assets, retain some pension eligibility until his income, apart from pension, reaches $ 107 a week or $5,564 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A married pensioner couple without a <span class="highlight">child</span> would not have their eligibility extinguished until their combined income, apart from their pensions, reached $179.50 a week, or $9,334 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Additional payments for children of permanently blind pensioners apart from the first <span class="highlight">child</span> are currently determined under the income and property test and will be subject to the new income test only as from 25 November 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance is to be increased from $10 to $15 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance is particularly designed  to help the parents  or guardians of severely handicapped children under the age of 16 years who need constant care and attention and who provide this care in the family home rather than place the <span class="highlight">child</span> in an institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This allowance is currently being paid to the parents or guardians of over 19 000 severely handicapped children who care for the children at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One aspect covered by the new guidelines is the position of infant children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new guidelines will provide that where an infant <span class="highlight">child</span> is diagnosed as having a physical or mental disability, by reason of which the infant is likely to qualify as a severely handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> within the terms of the legislation, eligibility to the allowance will be recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increase in the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s allowance from $ 10 a week to $ 1 5 a week is estimated to cost $3.4m in 1976-77 and $5.2m in a full year, bringing total expenditure to $ 14.1m in 1976-77 and $ 15.9m in a full year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the 1976-77 Budget allocation of $73.3m for <span class="highlight">child</span> care amounts to less than $23 per <span class="highlight">child</span> per year which is totally inadequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I take the example of children’s television in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be that as a result of the activities of the Australian Film Commission and as a result of the activities of the Film and Television School at some distant date in the future the quality of children’s television in Australia may improve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year in the Australian Capital Territory the Australian Council of Children’s Film and Television conducted a survey which showed that the average primary school <span class="highlight">child</span> watches television for 30 hours a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The cultural medium and the cultural values of those children are being obtained basically from television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no doubt that consumers of the prestige arts organisations in Australia are priviliged and that the children of Australia are grossly underprivileged in what they consume and in what might be described as their cultural  milieu. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security who assists the Prime Minister in <span class="highlight">child</span> care matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At page 12 of this publication figures indicate that there are 285 000 women with children 14 years of age or under who would like to work if proper <span class="highlight">child</span> care arrangements were available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister consider that the reduced allocation of funds for <span class="highlight">child</span> care in the recent Lynch Budget and the reduced resources for planning and administration following the abolition of the Children’s Commission, will enable the mounting of a <span class="highlight">child</span> care program adequate to meet the needs of the children of these 285 000 women who wish to exercise their choice of undertaking paid employment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The matters raised by the honourable senator with regard to the number of women with children who would like to enter the Australian work force are known to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter of <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities and resources comes within my Department and in this answer I am speaking as Minister responsible, not as Minister assisting the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What was said about the depletion of resources for planning and administration following the transfer of that matter to the Department of Social Security instead of its remaining as an interim committee of the Children’s Commission, was not accurate because all officers were transferred to the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been drawn to our attention that in some States <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities are not fully utilised at present- this would be so in some areas outside metropolitan citiesbecause of the lack of availability of suitable employment for women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have been back to the Island about two or three times since I left when I was a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was born and bred on Palm Island and I was a small <span class="highlight">child</span> when I left with my family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, when the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty made recommendations concerning family allowances it equally as firmly recommended the provision of further proper <span class="highlight">child</span> care services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second topic which arises from this legislation about which I wish to speak is the problem of the dependent children’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An amendment to this legislation in April or May of this year also mentioned dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children who are dependent on pensioners are in a very parlous state in this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many reports, including the Henderson Report on Poverty, have pointed out that families with children dependent on benefits and pensions are at a considerable disadvantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party has always been concerned about the children of these pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators know, the Labor Government when in office increased the dependent children’s allowance to $7.50 per <span class="highlight">child</span> a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We feel that if an argument can bc made to index the general pension twice yearly on the basis of movements in the consumer price index there is an argument also to increase allowances paid to children who are dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will allow for an increase in the rate of the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance and they will benefit a large number of Australians who depend upon pensions and benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have accepted without a murmur cuts in <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This shows that they do not give a damn about women who hold positions and need care for their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Baume  has said, it is appropriate that the party which first introduced <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to the Commonwealth constitutes the government that introduces major increases and alterations to that benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, we were the first government to introduce <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and to help the poor families with children and again we are the first government to introduce major reforms aimed primarily to benefit the lower income families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will be of greatest benefit to low income earners who have never paid enough tax to be able to take full advantage of all the <span class="highlight">child</span> rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This replacement of the tax allowance for children with increases in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment was a high priority suggested by Professor Henderson in his report following the inquiry into poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another amendment to the Social Services Act concerns that part of the Act which in the past has excluded certain children with their alien fathers from eligibility for this <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>School was resumed on Monday, 13 September but no <span class="highlight">child</span> was asked to present either a pass or a ticket before Friday, 1 7 September, and drivers were specifically instructed to be lenient, particularly towards small children, in the period beyond that date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Ryan’s question was asked prior to the expiry of the no-fare period and it is impossible that any <span class="highlight">child</span> could have been left stranded at a bus stop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> involved was the victim of a practical joke imposed on her by her school mates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as can be determined, at no point was the <span class="highlight">child</span> refused entry on a bus nor was she threatened or molested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948-1971 as amended, section 55 (4) of which stipulates that where a male pensioner marries after his retirement, pension shall not upon the death of the pensioner be payable to the widow or in respect of any <span class="highlight">child</span> of the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This sort of development comes at a time when there is an Industries Assistance Commission report on the arts in Australia which has turned up some fairly revolutionary suggestions, to put it mildly; at a time when there is an inquiry into the broadcasting and television industry which is solely concerned with the structure of the industry; and, as I said the other night, at a time when there is a situation in this country in which the average primary school <span class="highlight">child</span> spends more time watching television than he spends at school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time there is a stranglehold on the creative production process in Australia, very extensive arrangements for the cheap importation of commercial television programs from the United States and a situation in which there is not one body in Australia, including the Government, which seems to be seriously concerned with the sort of cultural development we get when, as I said, children of primary school age are watching television for more hours than they are attending school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard that phrase in respect of the cuts in the <span class="highlight">child</span> care budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of explanation, let me say that the facts of this matter are that  Mr Reardon  and his wife were divorced and that some weeks ago she, apparently using a passport which was improperly obtained from the British High Commission, abducted their <span class="highlight">child</span> and travelled to Singapore with this <span class="highlight">child</span> whom she had illegally taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Representations were made by  Mr Reardon  to the Western Australian Minister for Justice, who applied to the Commonwealth Attorney-General for extradition proceedings to be taken in Singapore to return  Mr Reardon  ‘s former wife, who is now  Mrs Ritzell,  and the <span class="highlight">child</span> to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 2 1 October the Attorney-General wrote to  Mr Reardon  a letter in which he referred to the fact that he had received a request from the Western Australian Minister for Justice regarding  Mr Reardon  ‘s former wife, Maureen Ann Ritzell, that she be surrendered from Singapore to Western Australia to face charges of disobeying a court order and <span class="highlight">child</span> stealing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only <span class="highlight">child</span> stealing is an extradition crime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That conclusion is in conformity with what I regard as an important principle, namely that extradition proceedings should not be used as an indirect means of obtaining or attempting to obtain custody of or access to children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The restoration of children is, I think, more properly a matter for civil proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As in this instance it is not so much a question of enforcing a divorce order made by the appropriate court but rather dealing with a breach of an order which amounted to <span class="highlight">child</span> stealing- an offence which is an extradition offence- can the Minister ask the AttorneyGeneral to give further consideration to this matter in view of the fact that it is not merely a matter of civil proceedings to obtain custody in a matrimonial suit but that there has been what is or is tantamount to a criminal offence committed by the absconding former wife of  Mr Reardon? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I simply draw to the attention of the  Senator that  the Senate Select Committee on Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders was concerned with this problem and with the undue contribution it makes to the death of Aboriginal children in Australia who, operating as these children often do on the basis of marginal nutrition, are particularly susceptible to gastro enteritis which plays a disproportionate role in the excess mortality we see among Aboriginal children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidence was also given to the Committee that in the Northern Territory, for example, many admissions of Aboriginal children to hospital are on the basis of gastro enteritis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Social Security a question concerning the proposed arrangements for holiday care programs for school children to be assisted by the Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care is to give support to vacation care projects in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that some consultations took place between the Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care and some of the applicants last week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care will be considering the applications and shortly will make recommendations for grants for the next school vacation period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hoped that these projects will be of assistance to children in the Australian Capital Territory, in particular those children of working parents, single parents and others who require this special service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course then money is short and, as many people will know, it comes from the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments and from the age pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the 1976-77 Budget allocation of $73.3m for <span class="highlight">child</span> care amounts to less than $23 per <span class="highlight">child</span> per year which is totally inadequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact what had happened was that in the interim essential funding of <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education had been passed to the Schools Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It refers to her recent statement regarding new arrangements for pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> care funding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister agree with the Assistant Minister for Health in Victoria,  Mr Jona,  that the new arrangements will lead to a breakdown in integrated childhood services? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs been drawn to a newspaper report of 1 1 November of a claim, attributed to an Opposition spokesman, that Aboriginal <span class="highlight">child</span> mortality will rise within the next year to a level of not less than 100 out of each 1000 Aborigines less than one year old? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that any predictions with regard to Aboriginal <span class="highlight">child</span> mortality would not reflect what was suggested by the honourable senator in his question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That we, the undersigned, declare that we are concerned at the increasingly alarming <span class="highlight">child</span> care situation, where only one place is available for every 10 pre-school children and where, in New South Wales, only 184 out of the 891 childcare centres in existence offer long day care for the children of working mothers, despite the changing socio-economic conditions in Australia and the increased numbers of working mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally can the Minister explain to the chamber why he expects unemployed youth genuinely seeking employment to accept $6 per week to work on projects such as <span class="highlight">child</span> care programs and recycling programs, which were mentioned in the release, when the Government could offer such work at award wages for the unemployed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During 1975 the average Australian school <span class="highlight">child</span> watched 218 hours of advertising on television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The average <span class="highlight">child</span> who left school in 1975 spent 15 120 hours in the classroom as against 17 520 hours in front of the television set. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The areas of <span class="highlight">child</span> care and dental care, particularly through rural Australia, are at a low ebb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am saying is that in the areas of health care, <span class="highlight">child</span> care, dental care and rural health care we are in a state of war because there are not enough workers in them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one travels around the fringe camps of Alice Springs one sees parents and children living in a state of absolute squalor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In one camp which I have visited one <span class="highlight">child</span> out of thirty-six of school age was attending school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reasons the other children were not attending school varied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason why that single <span class="highlight">child</span> was attending school was that both its parents had a certain minimal level of education, and they were of the few, as far as I could gather, of their race who still believed that education for their children meant something for the future of the childrenthe opportunity of a decent life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other children were not at school for a variety of reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Primarily, their parents were not motivated to send their children to school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On what basis does one motivate people if one cannot say at the end: ‘Here is something which is of benefit to you or your children”? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one talks to the teachers at those schools, one discovers that they think that it is a fortunate case if a particular <span class="highlight">child</span> attends a school for an average of 3 days per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some colleges take Aboriginal children from their families and train them to a certain level of ability in literacy and numeracy and they train some of those children to achieve a certain ability in subjects such as manual crafts, hygiene, <span class="highlight">child</span> care and nutrition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the people living in remote areas felt that the amount of money that was being spent on Aboriginals was in excess of what was being spent on the European children, and there was some reaction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have my own views on the greater needs of the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">child</span>, but one can see why the European parent should take the view he has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators may recall that he suggested in the case of a <span class="highlight">child</span> needing special assistance or special education that he should be given a number of alternatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He should be allowed to remain in the class with the rest of the children of his own age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is not possible, the second choice is to put the <span class="highlight">child</span> in the class and withdraw him for short periods to give him assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is not particularly appropriate, the third choice is to have a class in the school building so that the <span class="highlight">child</span> can be in contact during recess times and in the general context of the school with his own age group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fourth choice is to have a separate building, and the final choice is to send the <span class="highlight">child</span> interstate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first step is that the teachers who are working with these children would need to have teacher aides to assist them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are going to need more teachers- not many more but a few more- because obviously such a <span class="highlight">child</span> cannot be put into the class and be counted as one student. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More equipment will be needed to meet the special needs of this <span class="highlight">child</span> and there will need to be adequate teacher training to prepare the teachers to move in and work with these children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the 1976-77 Budget allocation of $73.3m for <span class="highlight">child</span> care amounts to less than $23 per <span class="highlight">child</span> per year which is totally inadequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-0-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That we, the undersigned, declare that we are concerned at the increasingly alarming <span class="highlight">child</span> care situation, where only one place is available for every ten pre-school children and where, in NSW, only 1 84 out of the 89 1 <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres in existence offer Long Day Care for the children of working mothers, despite the changing socio-economic conditions in Australia and the increased numbers of working mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I recall that during my childhood-and no doubt  Senator Sim  had the same experience- my father told me that it was important to turn off the taps and not waste water, and not to use radiators unnecessarily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I was a <span class="highlight">child</span> the problem was an economic one because my father could not afford to pay excessive power bills, and of course water was of great consequence in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At Port Pirie the other day there was an over-reaction when a <span class="highlight">child</span> trod in a dam and burnt his shoe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The burning was attributed to radioactivity, but the truth was that although the <span class="highlight">child</span> was playing in the vicinity of an old uranium dump, which had very little radioactivity in evidence and was simply eliminated by covering it up with a little earth, it proved to be not a uranium burn but a burn from the sulphuric acid which had leached into the dam from the nearby Port Pirie acid plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, the legislation will allow a widow or widower and <span class="highlight">child</span>, or a young couple with a widowed mother or mother-in-law to support, to make an application together provided that the application applies to their first home; that is the limitation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Aboriginal Children’s Adoption Service, a very necessary service, has been starved of funds ever since it was established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was set up to save the lives and to improve the health of Aboriginal children and to find out where Aboriginal children came from. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are many white people in the community who adopt Aboriginal children as wards, use them as pets until they are 13 or 14 years of age and then return them to a home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is fairly well known that a minister of religion, an official of the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement and Fisheries and one other person were involved in the kidnapping of that <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet an organisation such as the Aboriginal Children’s Adoption Service, which tries to keep black children with black relatives, friends or parents, is being starved of funds because its social value is not realised by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that a widow who receives a dependant allowance in respect of a school-age <span class="highlight">child</span> loses that dependant allowance the moment the <span class="highlight">child</span> leaves school? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My reason for asking the question is that a <span class="highlight">child</span> now completing examinations at school has to be supported by a widow because he or she is ineligible to receive the unemployment benefit and is perhaps incapable of getting a job, anyway, until the examination results are known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  question was related to family allowances and the additional pension and additional benefit for student children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I informed him that it was not formerly the practice to make a payment of additional pension or benefit to a <span class="highlight">child</span> over the age of 16 years who has left school, but in view of the practice that we have now adopted in regard to family allowances, we will in future ensure that the payment of the additional pension and the additional benefit in respect of school leavers will be continued until they commence permanent employment or become eligible to receive the unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The benefit will be continued to be paid until a <span class="highlight">child</span> leaves school or is eligible to receive the unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Figures show that in America a <span class="highlight">child</span> sees every hour between 5 and 9 violent incidents such as murder, rape, assault, accident or a fight, although the real figures show that the chance of a person being involved in such violence on any day is 14 000 to one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These showed that of the films that were shown during the hours children watched television, there were 57 hours of American films. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of Australian films that were shown in the hours that children could watch television there were 29 hours- one hundred per cent from the ABCand they included films that are called educational; that is, put on by the education departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the amount of films children watch in America, and I submit in Australia too because I do not think our children watch any less television than do American children, nor on the figures I have been given do they watch any less American television than do American children, a <span class="highlight">child</span> is involved with violence 25 times a day, even though the American figures show that the chance of a person being involved with violence is only 14 000 to 1. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a letter dated 13 September 1976 the Minister for Justice of Western Australia requested me to initiate proceedings for the extradition of a Maureen Ann Ritzell from Singapore on charges of disobeying a lawful court order and <span class="highlight">child</span> stealing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-89-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were two children ofthe marriage and  Mr Reardon  was awarded custody of the <span class="highlight">child</span> Elizabeth Ann, with reasonable access to her mother, and  Mrs Ritzell  was awarded custody of the <span class="highlight">child</span> Andrew David, with reasonable access to his father. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-89-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is alleged that  Mrs Ritzell  returned to Western Australia in August of this year and, on 20 August, picked up her daughter without  Mr Reardon  ‘s consent and left with the <span class="highlight">child</span> by air for Singapore on the same day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-89-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> stealing is an extraditable crime for the purposes of both the Extradition (Commonwealth Countries) Act and the Singapore Extradition Act and there appeared to be evidence that  Mrs Ritzell  has committed that offence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-89-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a general principle, one that has been accepted by Attorneys-General in successive Governments, that extradition should not be used as an indirect means of obtaining, or attempting to obtain, custody of, or access to, children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-89-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I endorse that principle and express the view that the determination of rights to children in circumstances Uke the present is properly a matter for civil proceedings by the parties concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-89-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia has previously refused requests by other countries for the return of fugitives where it was reasonably clear that the real purpose of the request was the recovery of possession of a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-89-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even if extradition of  Mrs Ritzell  is granted by the country in which she is found, the extradition would be of her, not the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-89-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I asked for leave to continue my remarks I was pointing out to the Senate that the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Science and the Arts had received a reference relating to the education of isolated school children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report indicates that the reference related to children who, for geographic reasons, have no reasonable daily access to an appropriate school or who cannot be afforded equal education opportunities with other children, or who cannot be provided with an education suitable to their talents and interests to equip them for employment in the occupational field they select. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another part of the reference invited the Committee to investigate the means by which these disabilities can be overcome, by extension and deployment more widely of schools or institutes of tertiary education and the provision of financial aid to isolated children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that the introduction of the then Commonwealth Government’s assistance scheme for isolated school children largely resolved the problem which was referred to in our reference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of this the Committee encountered some difficulty in arriving at an appropriate definition of what might be called an isolated school <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the assistance for isolated children scheme which was introduced in 1973 by the government of the day, an isolated <span class="highlight">child</span> was defined as one who, because of the geographic isolation of his home, did not have reasonable daily access to a government school providing courses of the appropriate level, that is either primary or secondary level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was making the point that the Committee which was dealing with the matter of education for isolated school children had to look very early at defining the meaning of an isolated school <span class="highlight">child</span> or a group of people known as isolated school children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I move now to that very important and needy group of children who require remedial instruction and who do not have access to special educational facilities in the region in which they happen to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must never overlook those children who suffer from short-term or long-term illness, or physical disabilities, or mental disabilities and who are isolated from the appropriate education facilities which might render them some assistance or opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the country boarding school area in particular that is significant, because quite frequently a parent in a remote area has faced the need to send a <span class="highlight">child</span> to the city- distances of thousands of miles- when in an intermediate area there might be a suitable school of good educational quality but without boarding or hostel facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the  Chairman  and members of the Committee would fully appreciate, the second home allowance for one <span class="highlight">child</span> which was $350 was increased to $500. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With regard to the question concerning facilities for providing meals at schools and the other associated nutritional or health matters, my own belief is- I can stand correction on this-that during the period of the Whitlam Government and for some years in any case there has been some argument that it is the responsibility not of schools but of parents to feed children properly, because if schools provide meals or clean clothing or shower facilities it takes from the parents a sense of responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator has raised a vital point that concerns those of us who have dealt with Aboriginal children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need to provide a learning environment as well as a healthy environment at school for Aboriginal children is vital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps my final comment should be that one of the big difficulties has been that in Aboriginal families, including the extended family, there is no study orientation to impel the <span class="highlight">child</span> from the home to school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much of the poor attendance of Aboriginal children at school in recent years has resulted from a disinclination on the parents’ side to bring the children to school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answer to some of the questions raised, I am aware of the formation of the Children’s Amputee Association in South Australia because I have had some correspondence from that Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The handicapped children’s allowance scheme is intended to give some assistance to parents who choose to care for their children at home rather than to place them in institutions, and to complement the Government’s other schemes of assistance for handicapped persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to the types of cases that were referred to in the newspaper article it would be appropriate to say that where a very young <span class="highlight">child</span> is fitted with a prosthesis, this may increase the amount of care and attention that is required to be given by the parents of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is generally accepted by medical experts that as the <span class="highlight">child</span> grows older he will cope more independently of his parents, especially where he attends a normal school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, medical experts have found that once a <span class="highlight">child</span> has adjusted to an amputation, with or without a prosthesis, the fitting of a new prosthesis usually does not cause significant new problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In cases that involve determining whether a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance is appropriate, we receive advice from the Commonwealth Medical Officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He determines whether the <span class="highlight">child</span> requires constant care and attention in the terms of the requirements for the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance and a decision is made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general, where a <span class="highlight">child</span> is able to attend a normal school and is emotionally and socially well adjusted and well adapted to the prosthesis which had been fitted, the Commonwealth Medical Officer would not decide that that <span class="highlight">child</span> was eligible for a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More pensioners than ever before will be eligible because the single invalid or age pensioner without a <span class="highlight">child</span> retains some benefit until his or her income reaches $114.20 a week, an increase of $16.70 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said in this place before, in 1941 <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment was first introduced in the Commonwealth sphere by a non-Labor government, the Menzies Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact, Australia was the first country in the world whose federal government introduced a non-means-tested universal <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment scheme funded entirely by general revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know the response of those women who have come through such an experience, the response to their unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> that ‘you have sought me and found me and I will not let you go’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present in these homes there are fourteen or fifteen children to only one officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that, if one of the children was hurt and had to go to hospital where the <span class="highlight">child</span> could well wait for two to two and a half hours, the other 14 children would be left completely unsupervised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are children who have been committed to homes because their parents cannot handle them, they are disadvantaged or they are under mild sentence from the court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am one who has been critical in this chamber of certain shop stewards in certain industries because of their conduct; but I was delighted a few weeks ago to see a report, again in South Australia, of a group of shop stewards at the General Motors-Holden’s Ltd plant at Elizabeth who, within the short space of a couple of days, raised a few thousand dollars to send the <span class="highlight">child</span> of one of their workmates to New Zealand because they felt that a specialist there could bring her back to full health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At one time it was very fashionable for the mother after the birth of her <span class="highlight">child</span>, to be told that she could not express milk for all sorts of reasons and that the baby should go onto cows milk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, due to a lack of education and a lack of hygiene and facilities in those societies, all too often the baby dies because the mother has never been taught that sterilisation of the equipment is extremely important and that there is no point in her taking the baby’s empty bottle to the stinking canal, giving it a rinse, putting the teat back on and giving it to the baby 4 hours later, because that is one way to a short life for her <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Technical and further education has always been the lame <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the sole male parent who would like to provide his children with a home perhaps would like to provide them also with a substitute mother until he sorts out his affairs and emotions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a sole male parent employs a housekeeper-and frequently we find that he employs someone who has experience with children or has a <span class="highlight">child</span> or children of her own- and she is in receipt of a supporting mothers’ benefit or a widows’ pension, her pension could be placed in jeopardy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the dependant’s allowance which is paid to all social welfare recipients with a dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> or children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether a recipient is an age pensioner, an invalid pensioner, a supporting mother or a widow an amount of $7.50 a week is paid for each dependent <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would mean that any pensioner with dependent children would receive $8.90 a <span class="highlight">child</span> a week instead of the present amount of only $7.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the previous Government the husband of a family with 2 children received $8.70 tax rebate and $1.50 <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, which adds up to $10.20 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A family with 4 children under the previous Government received $17.40 tax rebate and $5.75 <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, which adds up to $23.15 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer not only to the pressures that are put on mothers and fathers but also to the pressures that are put on children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where young people cannot get work fathers and mothers tend to agree with newspapers in some ways and call their children bludgers and say that they are not trying very hard, that they should be out working and that they are not proper citizens because they are not working an 8-hour day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That sort of pressure breaks up homes because the mother and father fight over what the <span class="highlight">child</span> is doing or should be doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Harradine  does not know how a woman feels in that situation, nor does he know the misery she feels when she finds herself pregnant and has to cope with the shame, the poverty, the loneliness, the inability to cope with the <span class="highlight">child</span> or children that she may bear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She knows the decision she has to make about whether or not a <span class="highlight">child</span> will be born. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When they make a decision to have a <span class="highlight">child</span>, it is up to people like  Senator Harradine,  rather than going on witch hunts, to make sure that they have the support services necessary to keep those children, to make sure that those children are brought up in exactly the same position as children who come from the best homes and the best families in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-I am unable to state the composition of the children who took advantage ofthe <span class="highlight">child</span> holiday care program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have no statistics which would show how many children were children of one parent families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am able to say that the funds that were allocated to 177 projects for vacation care benefited a large number of Australian children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that in the areas in which we gave financial support the organisers ofthe program will give some priority to the children who have the greatest need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">child</span> care vacation program has been of great benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think a great deal of needless anxiety is caused by those who speculate on programs, as people did about this time last year with regard to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment which was replaced by the family allowances scheme and as people did a week or two ago with regard to the indexation of pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Referring to earlier times, prior to 1935 Australia looked predominantly towards the United Kingdom and virtually regarded herself as a <span class="highlight">child</span> of the mother country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the junta in that country tried to foist a <span class="highlight">child</span> mutilator and a few other odd people on us as political refugees, but they were detected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the <span class="highlight">child</span> care legislation now under review? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act which is administered by my Department is under review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Consultations have been held with some people in the voluntary sector associated with children’s services, and with State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to whether we will amend the Act in line with the family allowance scheme, there is no real comparison between the family allowance scheme, which is a universal, non-taxable benefit to families and all Australian children, and the organisations which conduct services under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those services under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act are provided for a variety of reasons for care outside the home, because this is required by those who use them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that we will be able to devise amending legislation which will give support to organisations in such a way as to enable them to give the best type of care to children who are cared for outside their homes for reasons that are obvious in many cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The 2 organisations mentioned in the question have been given grants to look at the needs of children of working parents, sole parents and invalid parents- the children of people who do need the services of children’s centres throughout what might be termed a working day or a day where care is required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The grants provided were felt appropriate for research to be undertaken and the information that flows from this research will be used by the Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care in formulating policies and programs for the next Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stress that, if we were to look at the approvals for <span class="highlight">child</span> care services provided in the last Budget, this would be regarded as a very worth while project for the children of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the most striking inadequacies of the present education system from the view point of the Aboriginal people is that the system operates against the <span class="highlight">child</span> from the start of his or her education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For a school to be effective the <span class="highlight">child</span> must see it as having some purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my home town of Brisbane there were 3 Government high schools but frankly it was easier to get a <span class="highlight">child</span> through university with Commonwealth Government support then than it was to get a <span class="highlight">child</span> through high school so that that <span class="highlight">child</span> could go to university, because of the parlous state of the schools under a State Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only real alternative for people who cared about the education of their children was to send them to private schools which were comparatively very much more expensive in those days than they are today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have also indicated previously that subsidies for children in need in private day care centres can be the subject of discussion and, perhaps, decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Family day care was an innovation of the former Government to provide a means of caring for a very limited number of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fewer than 5 children usually are cared for in this way and usually they are cared for more on a domesticbasis than on a basis that would be required in a commercial operation in a larger centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that these criteria will be interpreted in a wider fashion because of the responsibilities which people will have for elderly members of their family who may be more distant relations than a mother or a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If any further information is required I will provide it to the honourable senator, but I want to say that the expenditure of almost $150,000 on vacation care programs represents a sizable contribution to the care of children whose parents are absent from the home and whose parents are unable to plan programs for them during the holiday period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770503_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> died and the parents, in all good faith, had a proper burial and spent some $400 on a memorial for the grave, thinking that the expenses would be paid from the insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On questioning the then Minister I found that this was a prescription in the Act to stop parents profiting from the death of their children or killing their children for the benefit they could get from insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The following answer has been provided: This clause, in conjunction with amendments in clause 28, increases the limit specified in sections 108 and 109 of the principal Act which a company may contract to pay on the death of a <span class="highlight">child</span> under 10 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770505_senate_30_s73/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be very unlikely that such parents would have the <span class="highlight">child</span> insured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770505_senate_30_s73/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The thing that worries me is that fast talking insurance salesmen can talk the parents of a <span class="highlight">child</span>, at the birth of the <span class="highlight">child</span>, into insuring the <span class="highlight">child</span> for an amount which is higher than $500 and which is payable if the <span class="highlight">child</span> dies after reaching 10 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770505_senate_30_s73/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But if the <span class="highlight">child</span> dies before it reaches 10 years of age, the insurance companies are limited in what they can pay, despite the existence of a contract in which they have undertaken to pay more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770505_senate_30_s73/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, if there were a successful prosecution against parents for killing a <span class="highlight">child</span>, there could be no insurance claim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770505_senate_30_s73/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If a person has entered into a contract, if that person is paying weekly premiums for compensation and if the <span class="highlight">child</span> dies before it reaches 10 years of age, the parents cannot get the total benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770505_senate_30_s73/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am aware that some low income families are seriously disadvantaged by the additional expenses which they incur because they have a <span class="highlight">child</span> who has a disability but who is not handicapped to the extent necessary to qualify for handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I recall it, the correspondence  referred to by the  honourable senator referred not so much to an inequity as to a difficulty of some parents of handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be understood that the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s allowance is not a benefit that is paid on an income test but is one that is paid on medical criteria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In terms of Government policy, particularly at a time of consideration of a Budget, I do not have the luxury of being able to speculate on Budget decisions or discussions, but I state again that I hold the view that there is a difficulty for low income families which sustain considerable expense in caring for handicapped children who may not meet the strict medical criteria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are homes where the hot water service will come through the ceiling and may land on some poor, unfortunate <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister will recall that I asked her to investigate a case where a <span class="highlight">child</span> amputee in Adelaide was declared ineligible for a handicapped children’s allowance although, according to a newspaper report, another <span class="highlight">child</span> with an alleged identical amputation was receiving an allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that since that time many parents have been notified that their children no longer qualify for such an allowance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without dealing with the specific case that has been mentionedbecause I am not clear that I have information which relates to it- I point out that the handicapped children’s allowance is payable in respect of a severely handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The medical officer’s task is to determine from the information provided on the application form, a section of which is completed by a medical practitioner who has supervised the handicapped, whether in his opinion the <span class="highlight">child</span> is handicapped to the extent that he qualifies for payment of the allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The medical officer also has at his disposal details of the care and attention provided for the <span class="highlight">child</span> and the number of hours a day such care is required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where it is considered necessary, the medical officer may himself examine the <span class="highlight">child</span> or seek specialist opinion, if one is not already available, to assist in his assessment of the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is provision for the medical officer to suggest a review medical examination at some future date if the <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s condition warrants it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the period from 1 July 1975 to 30 June 1976, 106 handicapped children’s allowances were cancelled throughout Australia, basically for medical reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each claim is considered on its merits taking into account the severity of the handicap, any secondary disability and the ability of the <span class="highlight">child</span> to cope with his handicap. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have had drawn to my attention the case of a woman living at Mount Gambier who had the necessary form forwarded to her during the school vacation this year when her eldest <span class="highlight">child</span> turned 16 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She filled in the necessary paper that was sent around to verify that her eldest <span class="highlight">child</span> had not, in fact, left school and was still a student. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She received the usual form for 16- year-olds questioning whether the <span class="highlight">child</span> was still at school or working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was completed and returned in January advising the Department that the <span class="highlight">child</span> was at school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Up to the date of mailing of this letter to me last week that lady still had not received the family allowance for her eldest <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Here is a woman with 4 children still waiting to receive that family allowance which she had been receiving for her eldest <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime she has to suffer the inconvenience of not being paid the family allowance for her oldest <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt when one has a girl who is 16 years of age it costs a lot of money to provide that <span class="highlight">child</span> with a uniform to go to school and other requisites for the <span class="highlight">child</span>, which are not or cannot be provided for out of the weekly pay packet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Senator Donald  Cameron pointed out to me, this woman would not even be receiving a student allowance for this <span class="highlight">child</span> whilst this matter is being held up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Labor Government was in office and was endeavouring to bring to Australia victims of the military junta in Santiago, that junta tried to increase the number of those refugees by including a few <span class="highlight">child</span> mutilators and other people like that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Is the Minister for Social Security aware that according to the Australian Federation of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Associations there are now many vacancies in privately operated <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres in Australia and that these vacancies are threatening the viability of such centres? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it true, as alleged, that the major reason for the increased number of vacancies is the Government continuing to build <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres in areas already serviced by privately operated <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it also true that the areas in most need of upgraded <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities, such as the western suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne, have been inadequately covered in the Government’s building program? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some indicators show that <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres are not being fully utilised in some places in Australia, but that does not mean that there is not a need for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres to be established in other parts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am having investigated the whole area of <span class="highlight">child</span> care access in Australia at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the facts are not only as may have been suggested by the honourable senator- that the Commonwealth Government is building <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres in some areas- but also that more women are finding it difficult to obtain employment, and what may have been a need in some time past is no longer the same need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the States we are reviewing the access to <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that we will in any future planning take into account the need for <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities and their geographic location, having in mind their accessibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the people in a workshop were to take industrial action to influence the employer to install a <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centre or creche in his factory, would that be covered by the exemption? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would be if women working in a factory under very poor conditions wished to take some sort of industrial action to gain a benefit, such as <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities or the facility to learn English during the course of their working day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Matters like <span class="highlight">child</span> care, access to health services and the ability to learn English so that they may know their rights as workers could very well not fit into the exemption defined in sub-section  3. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She referred to the example of women who take some industrial action for the purpose of trying to have English classes established in their work shop or to have <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres in their place of employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is an analogy between this superphosphate bounty and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The rate of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment was fixed for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> in about - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the rate of $ 12 a tonne for phosphate is different from the rate of 50c a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In about 1 949 the rate of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment was 50c for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> and in 1972, when the Labor Government came into office, despite the inflation that had been experienced, the rate was still 50c. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I used that analogy advisedly because there is a difference between the way in which this bounty is paid and the rate at which <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment is paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I preface my question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, by reminding her of three Press statements she issued on 14 July, 20 July and 29 July in which she denied rumours that a large amount of <span class="highlight">child</span> care money was being withheld despite the many community based <span class="highlight">child</span> care projects in urgent need of funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister why, in view of her repeated statements that all of the $73m allocated for children’s services in the last financial year was totally committed, she has described the $73m allocated in this Budget as an increase of $6.2m over last year’s expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>As I announced in August, the Government has decided to extend the eligibility for the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance to low income families who have the care, custody and control of the substantially handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where there is a case of a disease, particularly the disease mentioned by  Senator Bishop,  and continuing expenditure is involved and the medical criteria for eligibility are not established, the Director-General may consider that case to see whether he will allow a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance to be paid to that person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If honourable senators opposite examined the Budget Papers and the specific areas which were provided for in the period of the Labor Administration, would any of them suggest that it was wrong to make money available to local government for nursing homes, aged or disabled persons homes, delivered meals subsidies- called by different names from State to State- pre-schools and <span class="highlight">child</span> care, home care services, senior citizen centres, and so on? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It said to the Schools Commission: ‘We are going to pursue our policy that 20 per cent of the cost of educating a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a government school will be applied to the cost of educating a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a nongovernment school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister for Education seen an article in the  Sydney Morning Herald  today by Sarah Monks, the education reporter for that newspaper, claiming that there is a financial crisis in <span class="highlight">child</span> and adult migrant education services in New South Wales and that it has been caused by cuts in Federal Government funds? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not reflect in any way upon her as a person, but the actual basis of the article- that there are cuts in Federal funds for migrant education, whether adult or <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant educationis wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the bases for error in assessing this situation, as I have pointed out before in the Senate, is that a year ago a new basis for funding of <span class="highlight">child</span> migrants occurred whereby <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education was taken over and funded under the Schools Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is that, as all honourable senators know, the Aboriginal children have inherited from European civilisation a number of quite challenging illnesses, particularly upper respiratory tract infections, middle ear diseases and suppurating ears. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from anything else, it means that the <span class="highlight">child</span> so suffering is ill-equipped to be responsive to education and of course  unequipped  to enjoy the experience of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the real problems is that the children often come to school illequipped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>I have had discussions with representatives of the Department of Health in recent times in an endeavour to see whether we can get going a pilot scheme of involving trained nursing sisters moving from school to school and carrying out a screening of the Aboriginal children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must bear in mind that what we are doing is trying to create not only a currently healthy generation of children but also a generation of children who will take into their homes a knowledge of health and hygiene for the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we are talking about one particular family, I inform the Senate that if any member of that family were able to be considered for the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance under the new criteria it would certainly be open to the family to apply and the DirectorGeneral could consider whether the <span class="highlight">child</span> fell within the new terms of that allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since he has not been entitled to a pension he has had virtually no choice but to work, and thus has been further handicapped by the shortage of <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities, both for pre-school, after-school and holiday care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> care provisions for children outside the home may satisfy some, but others feel unable to handle the everyday tasks and responsibilities of the home and the children, or find that <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities do not fit in with shift work hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Quite apart from fringe benefits, a lone mother is entitled to a benefit of $47.10 a week plus $7.50 for each dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> and an additional mother’s allowance of $4 ($6 if she has a <span class="highlight">child</span> under six). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do not have enough of those <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was fortunate enough a couple of weeks ago to have a look at the industrial <span class="highlight">child</span> care project at an industrial complex in West Ryde. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But there is no funding forthcoming from this Government for the West Ryde <span class="highlight">child</span> care project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The infomation I was given at that time was that we should be seriously considering incorporating and encouraging industry to incorporate <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities into industrial projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The burden for the major funding of education- that is with respect to the funding of school education, pre-school education and <span class="highlight">child</span> care education- has been put back on the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When we look at the area of children’s services we find that this year’s allocation of $73.3m is the same amount as last year but, of course, in real terms it is a reduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The limitations on funds for capital grants in the area of children’s services means that there will virtually be no new community based <span class="highlight">child</span> care projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I draw the Senate ‘s attention to the extent of need in the area of <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a publication of the Australian Bureau of Statistics of 8 November 1977 which gives these figures:  222,000 children under 12 years of age not attending school were the responsibility of persons who worked away from home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is more than a quarter of a million Australian children need some form of <span class="highlight">child</span> care services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of these 42 per cent were looked after at home by the responsible persons’ spouse or some other person; 34 per cent were being cared for in other persons’ homes; and 16 per cent attended kindergartens, pre-schools, <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those figures indicate clearly that there is a very vast need for children’s services- not only for the children of working parents but also for children in many circumstances- which is not being met and which will not be met from the allocation in this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the situation of the supporting mothers benefit- I use that term advisedly because the Government refused to extend the benefit to supporting fathers despite the overwhelming evidence of the difficult circumstances in which many single fathers find themselves- we find that there has been no increase in the allowance per <span class="highlight">child</span> for the supporting mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allowance per <span class="highlight">child</span> is still $7.50 per week, which is what is was in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been no increase in the family allowancethat is the allowance which was substituted for the previous <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Earlier this year,  Mrs Molly  Dyer, an employee of the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service, was informed by an officer of the Victorian branch of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs that a sum of approximately $25,000 had been allocated to provide for the support of an Aboriginal <span class="highlight">child</span> care agency in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall draw the matter of funds for the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">child</span> care agency to the attention of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am unaware whether any application has been  made to my  own Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care with regard to support for this service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will overcome the problem despite the Opposition’s contributions which seem basically to be concerned with nurturing the <span class="highlight">child</span> it reared. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s inactivity and activity result in a high correlation between unemployment and wife bashing, unemployment and <span class="highlight">child</span> abuse and a range of mental and physical disorders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the difficulty of measuring the extent of unemployment amongst women, an Australian Bureau of Statistics survey called ‘Persons not in the Work Force’ which was published recently claims that at least 200,000 women- that is nearly a quarter of a million women- are looking for jobs but cannot enter the work force either because there are not any jobs available or because <span class="highlight">child</span> minding facilities are totally inadequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There again is highlighted the failure of the Government to provide an adequate <span class="highlight">child</span> care service throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the case, of course, that the Government has maintained in a way the <span class="highlight">child</span> care program which was initiated by the Labor Government, but it certainly has not been prepared to put resources or planning into it so that the majority of women needing <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities to enable them to take employment would be in a position to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> care allocation in the recently introduced Budget is of course no improvement on the amount of money that was made available least year and will not allow for any new <span class="highlight">child</span> care projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, those 11,000 women who are unable to take employment, even if they could find it, because of a lack of <span class="highlight">child</span> care services will continue to experience a lack of <span class="highlight">child</span> care service in the forthcoming year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the assistance to the children of supporting mothers amounts to about $7.50 a week which  Senator Walters,  who I understand is a parent herself, may realise is a hopelessly inadequate proportion of what it actually costs to support a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At 30 June 1976, 67 children were attending the school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, I wrote to him after receiving many representations from single parents, particularly single mothers, pointing out to him that the formula for working out a rental rebate took no account of the tenant’s dependants or the fact that single mothers had to pay up to $30 a week for <span class="highlight">child</span> care for each <span class="highlight">child</span> under school age before they could start living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yesterday the Minister wrote back to me, refusing to recognise the particular needs of single parents who must pay for <span class="highlight">child</span> care and refusing to recognise the anomalies that occur in that an individual is assessed for rental rebate in exactly the same way as a person with four or five dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She states that as it is, with her job and a part pension, she gets $100 a week income, pays $30 m rent, $20 in <span class="highlight">child</span> care and $20 to run a car, which leaves her $30 a week on which to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What action does the Minister propose to take concerning the Judge’s remarks that (a) Darwin’s Fanny Bay Prison and the Alice Springs Prison could provide practically nothing of value or training for prisoners, young or old, black or white: and (b) to imprison a <span class="highlight">child</span> (as was done) without a pre-sentence report, without thorough background knowledge, without at least seeking for causes, would be almost unknown in this country- save in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a group of women were really concerned about and fought for, say, <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities and their union backed them, it could be deregistered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Papers made the error of combining the amounts for adult migrants and <span class="highlight">child</span> migrants to get a total of the order of $22m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The whole scheme was Fraser’s brain <span class="highlight">child</span>, and for years now he has been employing his finely honed feudal mind in polishing up the last details of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister inform the Senate of the details of expenditure in recent years on both <span class="highlight">child</span> and adult migrant education? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education the figures are: 1974- 75, $13.11m, followed by an increase in 1975- 76, following a change to funding through the Schools Commission, to $2 1.81m and in 1976- 77, $25.99m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall, therefore, there has been a combined expenditure on adult and <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education as follows: for 1975-76, $30.04m; and for 1 976-77, $34.95m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, there will be new on-arrival English language programs for refugees, which will involve an expenditure of $820,000 on adult migrants and $ 144,000 on <span class="highlight">child</span> migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In summary, rather than there having been cuts, there have been significant increases in the adult and <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to a case in which two Indonesian nationals are facing deportation and a controversy surrounds the fact that they have two children who were born in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It amazes me that two people who are not citizens of this country but who had children born while they were in transit here were given Australian passports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Off the top of my head I always say that if a couple are in Australia and the woman has a <span class="highlight">child</span> while she is here, that does not make the offspring an Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The zero rate is generally not to apply in respect of income to which no beneficiary is presently entitled, or to income of a trust set up during the lifetime of the settlor where an infant <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 years of age is presently entitled to the income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A meeting of State Ministers who have responsibility in <span class="highlight">child</span> care and pre-school matters has been called for today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As soon as the Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care had available for me the information which the Ministers wished to discuss, the meeting was arranged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter of <span class="highlight">child</span> care is one of importance as far as we are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Extension of eligibility for handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance to less severe cases where the family income is low and financial hardship would otherwise be suffered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Handicapped <span class="highlight">Child</span>’s Allowance <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance of $ 1 5 a week is payable to parents or guardians in respect of a severely physically or mentally handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 years of age who is cared for at home and who, because of the severity of the handicap, requires constant care and attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This should not be confused with handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s benefit which is paid at $5 per day for handicapped children residing in an approved home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s allowance is designed to assist in meeting the exceptional costs incurred by parents or guardians who prefer to care for a severely handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> at home rather than to place the <span class="highlight">child</span> m an institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has come to notice that there are a number of low income families caring for a <span class="highlight">child</span> who is substantially handicapped but not severely handicapped and for whom a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s allowance is not paid because the medical criteria are not fully met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is aware of the additional costs that can be incurred in caring for a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> at home and that it places a strain- often a severe strain- on the finance of low-income parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These expenses can arise out of the need to provide special footwear or other clothing, special diets or specific medical or remedial treatment that the parents of other children are not required to provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has accordingly decided to extend eligibility for the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The DirectorGeneral of Social Services, at his discretion, will be able to grant a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance of up to $15 a week to a person on low income who is caring for a substantially handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allowance will be payable in respect of a <span class="highlight">child</span> whose substantial handicap does not fully meet the existing medical criteria, but where, because of continuing substantial expenditure associated with the <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s disability, the parent or guardian is, in the Director-General’s opinion, suffering severe financial hardship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where there are children, additional benefit of $7.50 a week is payable for each <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A supporting father will be eligible for benefit of $49.30 a week plus $7.50 a week for each <span class="highlight">child</span>, including a student <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, a guardian’s allowance of $6 a week will be payable where he has the care of a <span class="highlight">child</span> under six years of age, or an invalid <span class="highlight">child</span>- $4 a week if the <span class="highlight">child</span> is over six years but not an invalid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus a supporting father with two children, one of whom is under six years of age may receive, subject to the income test, a total benefit of $70.30 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, it extends the eligibility for the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s allowance to a low-income family with a less severely handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> when the care of that <span class="highlight">child</span>, in the words of the Act, is a severe financial handicap to the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We welcome the introduction of a further handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance, which is based more on financial need than the previous one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We welcome the fact that it is aimed at low income families who are in financial difficulties as well has having a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Senator Grimes  has said, it was originally designed by the Australian Labor Party to assist those families whose mother and father have decided to care for the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> at home rather than send him to an institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This allowance is in addition to the existing handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance, which is not means tested and which is granted on medical criteria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A discretionary handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance was introduced in this year’s Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is a benefit that will be paid in relation to children who do not reach the medical criteria of the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s allowance but who have other needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allowance will be paid at the rate of $ 1 5 a week or the amount of expenditure associated with the <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s disability, whichever is the lesser, with a minimum payment of $5 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Where the medical criteria and income test are satisfied the minimum rate of $5 a week will be payable without the need to investigate the level of expenditure associated with the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s disability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The types of expenditure that would be acceptable for the purpose would be such things as expenditure on medical and paramedical services, especially physiotherapy, after the deduction of health insurance refunds, the cost of transport incurred in seeking medical and other services, expenditure on special diets, prosthesis, spectacles and mobility aids, such as wheelchairs, expenditure on clothing in excess of the usual requirements, expenditure on shoes in excess of the usual requirements, school fees in excess of the usual cost, usually arising out of attendance at a special school, and expenditure on occasional <span class="highlight">child</span> care and special activities- for example, swimming lessons for spastic children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A low income family can be assisted by the payment of a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance to cover these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Payne’s  trip, and that of other State Ministers, was to discuss with me the matter of <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the meeting today we were able to discuss the funding of this year’s Budget appropriation of some $4m for new projects in <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We were able also to set up a meeting between State and Federal governments to arrange a three-year program for children’s services, starting from the Budget next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we still have vague expressions in proposed new section 105 ja where a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance is not paid if the family is ‘by reason of the provision of that care and attention, subjected to severe financial hardship’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by reason of that disability, needs care and attention only marginally less than the care and attention that he would need if he were a severely handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This alternative qualification was introduced so that there will be a flexibility with regard to the payment of the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The existing handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance is awarded on medical criteria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no way in which a <span class="highlight">child</span> who does not meet those medical criteria is able to receive a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance until we have passed this proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposal widens the eligibility for allowance to include those children who do not meet the medical criteria which presently exist but who are substantially handicapped and have a continuing expenditure for their special needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I stated earlier, this allowance will be payable to a parent or guardian where the family income does not exceed the adult minimum weekly wage, plus $6 for each <span class="highlight">child</span> or student <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allowance will be paid at the rate of $ 1 5 a week, or the amount of expenditure associated with the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s disability, whichever is the lesser, with a minimum payment of $5 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the medical criteria are concerned, we will be guided by the Department of Health in determining the degree of handicap of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will not be the same strict criteria as are applied to other handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowances which now exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There seems to be some misunderstanding in the community as to the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allowance was to be paid to families who cared for handicapped children in their own homes as an alternative to institutional care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the way in which the existing handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s allowance is administered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We felt that there were children with a degree of handicap which would warrant assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because of this that we have introduced a flexible arrangement under which we are able to determine the substantial handicaps of children who need continuing expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If some other item I did not mention could be seen to be a requirement of a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> that could be considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There already is some difficulty in understanding the various definitions of ‘severely handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we may have trouble with the definition of handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This relates to the cessation of the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance granted under section  105ja. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have stated that the Director-General should have regard to income, to the failure of a person to comply and to the fact that the degree of handicap no longer causes the continuing expenditure or the <span class="highlight">child</span> reaches an age where some other benefit or some other situation occurs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as with other handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> allowances, this allowance is always subject to medical review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a father is unemployed and gets only one weekly unemployment benefit payment in four or five weeks and has a <span class="highlight">child</span> leaving school who is unable to get the unemployment benefit for six weeks, how will he maintain that <span class="highlight">child</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> will be deprived of the unemployment benefit for six weeks and that will throw a further burden on State welfare services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How will he be able to maintain a <span class="highlight">child</span> who has left school and who also is unemployed now that the Government intends to pay the unemployment benefit in arrears and the <span class="highlight">child</span> cannot - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator McLaren  mentioned the situation of a parent who was receiving unemployment benefit and had to provide support for a student <span class="highlight">child</span> who had left school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where a parent was receiving a rate of unemployment benefit which took into account dependent children, that additional payment would be continued during the period of six weeks before eligibility for unemployment benefit had been achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it were a family allowance for a student <span class="highlight">child</span>, that would be continued until the period of non-payment of the unemployment benefit was covered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last time we received the guidelines for the payment of special benefits m necessitous circumstances they involved a sudden drop in income, of which no <span class="highlight">child</span> who leaves school can produce evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the guidelines as we know them it is going to be very difficult for any school <span class="highlight">child</span> to receive special benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one considers that a <span class="highlight">child</span> of a person receiving the unemployment benefit is going to be considered by the Government to be satisfactorily paid if his or her parent receives the children’s allowance plus the family allowance, which might add up to about $7 or $8 a week, one can imagine what sort of restrictions are going to be applied before anyone will be eligible for special benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These are: General resources programs- general recurrent grants, including funds for <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant and multicultural education, emergency aid for nongovernment schools, and capital grants and specific purpose programs- disadvantaged schools and schools in disadvantaged country areas, special education for handicapped children including children living in institutions, services and development including education centres, and special projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He forgot to promulgate regulations that any Australian mother who bore a <span class="highlight">child</span> overseas had the right to go to the nearest Australian Embassy and have the <span class="highlight">child</span> registered as an Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we pointed out at the time of its introduction that if the family allowance were introduced in this way and if tax rebates for children were abolished, if justice was to be maintained, it was essential that that family allowance should be regularly upgraded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have produced tables, never questioned in the Parliament, which demonstrate that with the introduction of the Medibank levy and of the family allowance and with the scrapping of the children’s rebates which would have been indexed, what has happened is that anyone earning $120 to $200 a week who has more than one <span class="highlight">child</span> has less disposable income now than he would have had under the old tax scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the same recommendation Professor Henderson recommended that the supporting mothers’ benefit should be a Commonwealth responsibility, and that to maintain justice in the community home care help, infant welfare, <span class="highlight">child</span> care and general accommodation services for women in distress and children in distress should be upgraded and should be funded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first has been that it has killed any hopes that have existed in this country, initiated by the efforts of the former Labor Government, to raise education in this country to standards which would enable every <span class="highlight">child</span> at a government or nongovernment school, and later in the tertiary institution, to obtain the kind of education which that <span class="highlight">child</span> wants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the last few weeks we have had question after question being put in this chamber to the Minister for Education  (Senator Carrick)  by Government senators- we call them Dorothy Dixers- in response to which he has made it quite clear that he is happy to see the old State aid debate reactivated in this country, to the detriment of all school children in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do appeal to the Schools Commission to come back to the conception we had about its work, that is, that it is quite  irrelevant to the Commonwealth whether an Australian citizen happens to be a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a government school or a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a non-government school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At 30 June 1977 there were 238 centre based <span class="highlight">child</span> care services operating and receiving Federal Government recurrent assistance (including multi-functional centres); 114 Family Day Care Schemes operating and receiving Federal Government recurrent assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should be understood in respect of student children that the Social Services Act specifically provides that family allowance payments cease from the end of the four-weekly payment period in which the full-time education ceases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The procedure of the Department is to post a review form to parents and on the undertaking given by parents the family allowance is either resumed or deferred until such time as the parents advise what action will be taken by the student <span class="highlight">child</span> in the following year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, the average woman with two dependent children would be considerably worse off financially because of the removal of the tax concessions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although modern psychology diverges on a number of matters, there is almost unanimous agreement that the ideal way for a <span class="highlight">child</span> to grow up is for him to grow up in an environment in which he becomes strongly attached to those people who care for him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So, the ideal climate in which a <span class="highlight">child</span> should be reared is with his own parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The evidence indicates that the family is the most effective and economical system for fostering and sustaining the development of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Putting on one side the consequences to the young <span class="highlight">child</span> of divorce legislation which protects the irresponsible partner in the marriage, when the concept of guilt is removed from consideration in the dissolution of a marriage- I am happy to concede that that has happened in the family law context- all that happens really is that the concept of guilt is considered at the <span class="highlight">child</span>-custody level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst the Family Law Act has made it very easy for a marriage to be dissolved, the custody of the children and the property settlement are still matters over which the parties argue, very often to the distress of the children of the marriage who, I think, are the major concern of all of us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The truth is that managing a home and children can be a full time job until the children are grown up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true to say that a wife and mother acting as a full time housewife and mother does save the state considerable sums of money in terms of <span class="highlight">child</span>-minding services and other social services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Studies of women in the work force in several countries show that, although a woman is fully employed outside her home, she still does some 70 per cent of the <span class="highlight">child</span> and home care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Time does not permit me to go into greater detail so I will conclude on this note: Next year, 1979, is the Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> and, whilst we are all gravely obsessed with the economic problems which confront the nation, in the long term the preservation of the family as a unit in society is vital to the future of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the other hand, our children were allowed to walk into Parliament House without their bags and so on being searched. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would appear that if somebody wanted to place a bomb in Parliament House the best thing to do would be to get a 12-year-old <span class="highlight">child</span> to bring in a bomb with a timing device attached to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the first instance, I am concerned that the statutory responsibility of the Director, Department of Children ‘s Services is being ignored as a result of substantial funding to a voluntary agency proposing to work in the field of <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare, and, secondly, that consultation at an appropriate level concerning the proposed funding had not taken place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the past two years the Government has done a good deal, for example, by the improvements in the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance and the handicapped children’s benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Arrangements are in hand for States and Territories to establish welfare programs aimed at assisting parents to improve their <span class="highlight">child</span>-rearing practices and thereby improve family functioning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is a 3-year funding program through the Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care to provide funds for voluntary community organisations which are engaged in activities of support to families such as family counselling, financial counselling, advisory services, and services relating to ethnic groups, Aborigines and lone parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In some places the State consultative committees on social welfare have established sub-committees to deal with <span class="highlight">child</span> care matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A number of influences operate on the young person as he moves through his childhood into maturity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is there that the <span class="highlight">child</span> gets his original foundation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Jesuits suggest that the years of a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s life from nought to six set a certain pattern for the rest of his life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most educators suggest that there are times during the life of a <span class="highlight">child</span> when he is more susceptible to suggestion than at others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My own feeling is that the home has the greatest influence, if it has something to contribute to the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps to use the word ‘change’ goes back to the old original sin concept that the <span class="highlight">child</span> comes in with problems which need to be corrected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless educators do tend to stick to this concept of attitude change; that the <span class="highlight">child</span> has come in and if there has been no change there has been no education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not mean parents in a broad sense, I mean those parents who have a <span class="highlight">child</span> who falls into the general category of ‘juvenile delinquent’ or a <span class="highlight">child</span> who has fallen foul of the law, to continue to use that phrase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No doubt the Minister in her explanation of the Government’s support for the Centre will claim that the grant administered by her is a specific purpose grant to investigate <span class="highlight">child</span> care matters and that it has nothing to do with the Centre’s activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It matters little to the Centre whether the grant is supposed to be for investigating <span class="highlight">child</span> care or any other subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As those three bodies represent specific groups of women- professional women, country women and women from one religious group -and in view of the fact that when last September the Union of Australian Women was told by the Government Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care in Canberra that it was one of only three organisations that had shown any interest in the Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>, will the Minister increase the membership of the Committee to give wider representation, including representation of the Union of Australian Women which has done a deal of work on its own on this important matter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A committee of nongovernment organisations has been set up to assist in the observance of the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>, but that committee does not consist only of representatives from the three organisations mentioned by  Senator Melzer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many organisations, including the Union of Australian Women, which have made representations to be on a national committee or to work in connection with the observance of the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> may find that they are invited by State governments to be on their committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the parents who have a severely handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> and who provide care in their own homes, the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance was increased from $10 to $15 a week from November 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister whether she is aware that parents of young children attending the Oakbank Kindergarten in the Adelaide Hills are greatly concerned that the hours of operation of this kindergarten have been reduced from a full day to a half day, that children under four years of age are no longer accepted and that staff are being relocated due to a reduction in Federal funding for the employment of kindergarten teachers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask this question as it seems to be an anomaly that costs for a housekeeper can be claimed as a tax rebate but moneys paid to <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres cannot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the moment my advice is that a payment to a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre is not conemplated within allowable rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As honourable senators will know, under present law a tax rebate of $555 is allowable where a housekeeper is wholly engaged in keeping house for a taxpayer and caring for the taxpayer’s <span class="highlight">child</span> who is younger than 16 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a functional distinction to be drawn between this position and that of the working single parent who puts his or her <span class="highlight">child</span> in a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre during working hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question of allowing costs of <span class="highlight">child</span> minding for particular categories of taxpayers has been examined on a number of occasions in past years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I said that it could be that pre-school education had not had the priority in South Australia that it had in Victoria, for instance, I pointed out to the honourable senator that the Victorian Government had promised free pre-school education to every Victorian <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Branch is concerned with the development of policy proposals and advice on <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education, and on the English language teaching aspects of the Government’s programs of education for immigrants, Aboriginals and overseas students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-66-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition, in my Press Statement of 6 November 1977 I announced that the Government had approved additional funding in the form of a grant of $60,000 over two years to finance a special nutritional program to help Redfern Aboriginals cope with <span class="highlight">child</span> malnutrition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780815_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An income test is to be applied to a <span class="highlight">child</span> to determine the eligibility of parents to a payment of a family allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions that were announced last night state that if a <span class="highlight">child</span> is in receipt of income above a certain level there will be a withdrawal of the family allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When introduced, the family allowance scheme took into account the tax rebates which were given for dependent children in addition to the then <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time, the <span class="highlight">child</span> rebate which was given to the taxpayer diminished in accordance with the separate net income of the <span class="highlight">child</span> concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The change that was announced by the Treasurer last night takes into account the separate net income of the <span class="highlight">child</span> concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such income is different from the personal exertion income that may be gained by a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My Department will be announcing the way in which the test will be applied to a <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s income for the previous year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this proposed new scheme mean that every <span class="highlight">child</span> who earns over $6 a week will thereby prevent his or her mother from receiving the full amount of the family allowance to which she is entitled? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, does the Government have some kind of hostility against children who are attempting to supplement their pocket money by delivering newspapers, et cetera? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I indicated that income of such a nature earned by a <span class="highlight">child</span> would reduce or eliminate the amount of the family allowance that would be paid to the families involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The announcement last night by the Treasurer was clear, I believe, to all who read it, and stated that in future family allowances will be income tested on the basis of a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From 1 January 1979 allowances will be paid as at present in respect of each <span class="highlight">child</span> having an income of $312 or less in 1977-78 but will be reduced at the rate of 25c in the dollar on account of any income in excess of $3 12 received by the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parents of children with a separate net income above $312 a year will therefore receive a reduced benefit in respect of such children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Later this year the Department will send a form to every recipient of the family allowance explaining the effect of the change and requesting details of the income earned by each <span class="highlight">child</span> during the 12 months ended 30 June 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Harradine referred to the fact that the family allowance that is paid to the parents of children who are earning pocket money would be reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the Government is concerned, the family allowance scheme did relate to the <span class="highlight">child</span> rebate scheme- that is, the tax rebate at the time it was introduced- and the previous <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is believed that there are many children who have income from trusts and income from other sources who could not be classed as dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can say only that I am sure that the effect of the Budget in its entirety and the effect of the almost $ 1,000m that will be paid in family allowances next year will show that this Government has been very responsive to the needs of Australian children and the strengthening of the Australian family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Was the introduction of a means test on family allowances aimed principally at wealthy children who receive an unearned income through inherited property or through devices such as income splitting by trusts? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it possible to means test these people without discouraging enterprising children, many of whom are from low income families? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What would be the cost to revenue of exempting from the family allowance means test any income earned by the personal endeavour of the dependent <span class="highlight">child</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government introduced the means test on children’s income after reflecting on the fact that the family allowance scheme replaced the tax rebate which had previously been given to parents for a dependent <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the tax rebate was given to the parent for a dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> the income of the <span class="highlight">child</span> was taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (2) Section 103 (1) ofthe Social Services Act 1947 specifies the circumstances where family allowance ceases to be payable in respect of a <span class="highlight">child</span> or student <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-11">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Paragraphs (a) and (b) relate to situations where an endowee ceases to have the custody care and control of a <span class="highlight">child</span> and where a <span class="highlight">child</span> enters an institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-11">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware of the concern that is expressed in the community with regard to the means testing of family allowances to take account of the basis of a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say again, as I said last week, that, in taking this decision, the Government had in mind circumstances where, as a result of trusts and other income-splitting devices, children receive separate income whilst their parents continue to receive the family allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is concerned to ensure that the decision does not have unintended consequences, particularly in cases where children receive small amounts of income as a result of part-time jobs which they undertake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of the comments and the concern which has been expressed the Government is reviewing this decision with a view to eliminating any unintended consequences whilst preserving the principal purpose behind the decision, that is with respect to those cases where children are in receipt of trust income and other income-splitting device income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister say whether a clear distinction might be drawn between earnings obtained by a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s own efforts and earnings from sources which do not require direct effort on the <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s part? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter raised in the first part of  Senator Knight’s  question as to whether there would be a distinction with regard to earnings obtained by a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s own efforts is being reviewed by the Government and will be clarified in the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other areas such as the maintenance which is received from the father of the children and paid to a former wife, incomes from scholarships and Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowances, need clarification since the announcement of the Budget decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the draft legislation is completed I hope to be able to make a specific announcement so that there is no uncertainty about the means test which will be applied to incomes in the hands of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister say now what procedure the Government proposes to take to ascertain the incomes that children receive from trust accounts and /or partnerships? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who will be legally responsible for providing the information- the mother, the father or the <span class="highlight">child</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It believed that where a <span class="highlight">child</span> could not be regarded as a dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> the family allowance would be means tested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I adverted to the fact that when the family allowance scheme was set up the original tax rebates for dependent children were used as part of the source from which funds were able to be drawn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, because of the concern that has been expressed in the community the Government has reviewed the decision and will make it clear when drawing up the legislation that it does not intend to include in the means testing arrangement income which results from the personal exertion of the <span class="highlight">child</span> concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question which I direct to the Minister representing the Minister for Health refers to children who suffer from brain damage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many years the program was available only to those Australians who could afford to take their children to the United States of America or to Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of those factors, I ask the Minister: As the United Nations prepares to focus the world’s attention on the rights of children with the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>, what is Australia doing to ensure that its brain damaged children are given every opportunity to full recovery? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> and the focus on handicapped children and their treatment are concerned, I am able to say that, under our handicapped persons’ assistance program and under our Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care program, some projects are able to be funded in this year which will have special significance as a celebration of the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the general question about focussing the world’s attention on handicapped children in the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> is concerned, I will certainly do what I am able to do to see that this is brought into focus but that it goes further and that there are projects which have support from State and Federal government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-When did the Minister for Social Security first realise that the tax to be imposed on a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s income in excess of $312, which was announced in the Budget last week, would affect families other than those whose children’s incomes are derived from family trusts, partnerships, et cetera? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we then divide the $120 into the $37m saving for this particular section of the new scheme we find that a minimum of 300,000 children would have been affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the new scheme was to operate on a sliding scale basis, that is ‘ reduced at the rate of 25c in the dollar on account of any income in excess of $312 received by the <span class="highlight">child</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The more likely number of children affected will be over half a million. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Senate believe that there are that many children involved in trusts and other income splitting arrangements? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Either my calculations are incorrect; the scheme was always envisaged to cover more than just those involved in the trusts angle- and so the statement that the test would also apply to income derived from the personal exertion of children was not factual; or that the Government has no clear idea at all of what savings on Budget outlays will result from that scheme however it is amended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate is of the opinion that the Australian Government’s involvement in the 1979 International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> should pursue, as a major theme for action, the position of the <span class="highlight">child</span> in the context of the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I had hoped to have been able to make an address prior to this, but since the motion was put down committees have been established in respect of the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The European Ministers hope that this event will stimulate a better understanding of the positions of the <span class="highlight">child</span> in the social and family context in every country of the world, taking into account the conditions, needs and priorities of each country, and that it will make it possible to develop measures designed to foster the physical, mental and social well-being of all children, and in particular those of the third world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, that is the type of attitude expressed by the Director of the New South Wales Council of Social Service,  Mrs Eva  Cox, and I draw that to the attention of the Minister and of those who will be dealing with the direction of the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Many people within the community will be looking to the attitudes of the committees to see whether they are supportive of the <span class="highlight">child</span> within the family context particularly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the $98,000 which has been allocated to the family research project at the University of New South Wales for 1978-79 intended to have particular reference to the stated objectives of the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>, that is, to raise the level of services to children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The project’s objectives do not have a direct relationship to the observance of the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>, although, of course, it will be understood that information which may flow from the report will have significance in programs next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The basic reason that in the report I tabled yesterday no reference is made to early childhood is that the Commonwealth Department of Education does not have that responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Responsibility for <span class="highlight">child</span> care falls upon the Commonwealth Department of Social Security and its Minister, my colleague  Senator Guilfoyle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within the various States various departments undertake <span class="highlight">child</span> care and pre-school responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The first time that this country had a national educational policy that could possibly be called so, as distinct from a whole series of ad hoc emotional gestures in response to perceived electoral threat, and which was concerned in a foresighted way with the needs of every Australian school <span class="highlight">child</span> was in 1973 when the Karmel Committee adopted the needs policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our position and the position of the Government between 1973 and 1975 was quite clear on that issue, namely, that irrespective of whether children were being educated in private schools or in government schools every <span class="highlight">child</span> in this country was entitled to the maximum assistance which a government could give based on the needs of that <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the first time we put an end to the attitudes which were very prevalent in this country- in a sense they still are, particularly amongst government members- in which education is seen as a means of advancing one’s own <span class="highlight">child</span> as against other children in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know what that means in terms of a Greek migrant <span class="highlight">child</span> in the inner suburbs of Melbourne who is told that  Senator Carrick  is concerned about quality in education, but I know that it is very important for that Greek migrant <span class="highlight">child</span> to have the benefit of multilingual teaching in the school, to have the benefit of teachers who can speak in his language and in that of his family, who can speak to his parents, and who can help him to assess his identity in a difficult situation and in a difficult environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know what  Senator Carrick  is talking about when he says those things, but I do know what is important in terms of those things to the average <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It had a mutual concern for the needs principle and the needs of every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last two sets of guidelines there has been very great concern for the interests of the wealthy private schools as distinct from the interests of the poorer independent or non-government schools and as distinct from the interests of children in government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the most classic illustration within the nongovernment sector of this Government’s commitment to inequality in education, a divisive commitment which tends to divide the Catholic <span class="highlight">child</span> in this community from the Protestant <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a commitment which divides the Catholic school system <span class="highlight">child</span> from the <span class="highlight">child</span> in the government school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of very great concern is the way in which this Government has approached this matter, As I said, the Government’s approach is inequitable, divisive and is tending to set the interests of one <span class="highlight">child</span> in our community against the interests of another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This comes from a government which we were promised in the 1977 GovernorGeneral’s Speech would be a government for all people in Australia, a government which one would hope at least would be a government for all children in Australia, and not a government which is dedicated to providing unequal resources for Australian school children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Marriage breakdowns, crime, suicide, <span class="highlight">child</span> delinquency and other ills are brought about by insecurity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That’s about $400 for every man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> in the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>5m provided in the Budget are funds for adult and <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education programs which will help to improve the literacy rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some weeks ago while visiting Melbourne on another matter I was brought into contact with the Australian Centre for Brain Injured Children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A friend in Frankston, Melbourne, with whom I was staying, took me to see a <span class="highlight">child</span> who had suffered brain injury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Never in my whole life have I been as affected as I was by seeing the scheme for the treatment of brain injured children which is administered by the Australian Centre for Brain Injured Children in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I visited the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s home and saw the devotion, love and affection that emanated from the young couple, who have a boy and a girl who has suffered brain injury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I saw the way that the <span class="highlight">child</span> was treated under this scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present there is no way that families of brain injured children can get any assistance from the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I intended to give the Senate a definition of children who come under this category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">child</span> at the moment of conception is meant to have, as we know, a good brain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The definition includes children diagnosed as having cerebral palsy or Downs syndrome, spastic children, mentally retarded children, autistic children and so on, and any <span class="highlight">child</span> who is now functioning below peer level as a result of brain injury, ranging from a severely hurt <span class="highlight">child</span> to one with learning problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the home of the <span class="highlight">child</span> whom I went to see a special room had to be built and special equipment had to be bought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eight hours a day, six days a week must be devoted to assisting the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parents’ love and understanding naturally is helpful to the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Centre for Brain Injured Children recognises this fact and tries to encourage it wherever possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> I am speaking about had no future whatsoever, but today is walking, talking, reading and writing after only 12 months of treatment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> at eight years of age could do nothing for itself and had the functions of a <span class="highlight">child</span> two to three months old. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was no future for the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Today there is a bright and beautiful future for this <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Previously parents of children such as the <span class="highlight">child</span> to whom I have referred had to take their children to America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parents in Brisbane, Townsville, Perth, Adelaide or somewhere else in one of the other States incur on top of the cost of treatment which is $ 1 ,800, the cost of fares for themselves and the <span class="highlight">child</span> and the cost of accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That expenditure is just not possible for most of the families who have children who need this kind of attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the Government have a look at this matter and under the health scheme or in some other way provide financial assistance for families with children who suffer these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social Security to look more closely at the matter that I raised in relation to brain damaged children and to make some investigations of the Australian Centre for Brain Injured Children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps we can do something to assist financially the families of children who have brain damage and who are seeking treatment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Every <span class="highlight">child</span> in this country is entitled to the best that Australia can afford. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge the Government at least to make some investigations and inquiries and then to devise some means whereby the Australian Centre for Brain Injured Children can receive some assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator will be interested to know that in 1976 the average cost of maintaining a primary school student in the Australian Capital Territory was $988, whereas the average cost of maintaining a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a State primary school was $835. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost of maintaining a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a secondary school in the Territory in 1976 was $1,660, compared with $1,494 in a State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Brought down in the Budget was the so-called newsboys’ tax under which the parents of a dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> who received an income above a stipulated level would be ineligible for a family allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That provision was put in by  Mr Fraser  and those other Government members whose perceptions of reality, when considering the question of whether dependent children should have incomes, were . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would not occur to a person like the Prime Minister that there are children in Australia who earn pocket money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their perception of reality and the incomes of dependent children is of course related to children who receive income from family trusts set up for the purpose of evading taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But instead of doing the logical thing and tightening up on the tax laws on family trusts which have enabled people such as the Minister for Industry and Commerce  (Mr Lynch),  the Prime Minister, the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  and no doubt virtually all the senior Ministers of this Government to evade taxation, they thought it would be a better idea to phase out family allowances for dependent children who have incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that over the past three years the Government has extended very greatly its aid to isolated children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some 20,000 children will be assisted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As promised in the 1977 policy speech, an additional $ 100 per <span class="highlight">child</span> is payable in 1978 to families living in tax zones A and B whose children are eligible for the basic boarding allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An additional $100 is payable for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> in each family qualifying for second home allowance assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Northern Territory we pay a supplementary allowance of up to $150 a year for children eligible for the basic boarding allowance, and a supplement of $50 a year for Territory children who qualify for the basic correspondence allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall that in August we discussed the income testing of family allowances on the basis of income in the hands of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following our party meeting today, at the Press conference which is held subsequent to each party meeting I advised the Press that last night the Cabinet had made a decision that family allowances would be means tested on the basis of income received by children at a threshold of income in excess of $1040 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, if a <span class="highlight">child</span> is in receipt of income of $20 per week the means test will be applied to the family allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The income that will be exempt from family allowance testing will be maintenance payments received on behalf of children, scholarship income including Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowances, superannuation compensation, pension income, and trust income derived from deceased parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That figure is based on a threshold of $1,040 per annum and a $ 1 for $4 withdrawal rate; that is, that a first <span class="highlight">child</span> may earn $20 a week and indeed will continue to receive some family allowance until his income has reached $34. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should make it quite clear that the income testing of the family allowance is to be on the bas,is of the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that when the family allowance scheme was introduced, two factors were put together- the old <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment scheme and the taxable rebate scheme for dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has taken into account the fact that there was an abatement of that rebate for dependent children when a <span class="highlight">child</span> had income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that it is income in the hands of the <span class="highlight">child</span> that will decide eligibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Family allowances, orphans pensions, handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance and additional pensions or benefits for a <span class="highlight">child</span> will generally no longer be payable in respect of children who are classed as living abroad on a permanent basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No change is contemplated in the conditions under which family allowances, the double orphans pension and the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance are available to people, including Australian Government employees, who are temporarily absent from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, no change in the eligibility conditions is proposed where the subject <span class="highlight">child</span> is temporarily overseas or is awaiting migration to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should explain that the general purpose behind the proposal is to prevent the payment of family allowances, the double orphans pension or the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance and the additional pension or benefit that is paid on behalf of children who are unlikely to come to Australia, regardless of whether they have been here before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exceptionally, additional pension or benefit will continue for a <span class="highlight">child</span> with an Australian pension who is living overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter is not basically a <span class="highlight">child</span> of the parliamentary Labor Party but rather it demonstrates that the Labor Party is still subject to manipulation by elements within the trade union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How many more deaths, how many more unloved children need there be before we wake up? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How little we as politicians, understand the problems of the unwanted <span class="highlight">child</span> or the abused wife? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> care and pre-school allocations have been smashed to smithereens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It covered women’s refuges, <span class="highlight">child</span> care centresone could go on- and involved people in the community in looking after young children, with the Government topping up only one- fifth of the cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have no objection to married women working but believe that our policies should not actively encourage married women, especially if they have young children, to work at low wage rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fair enough if married women can earn wages high enough to pay for <span class="highlight">child</span> minding services and such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is bad enough for its effect on the unemployment problem, but is terrible for the children and must be creating psychological problems that, in due course, we will have to pay for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Is the Minister for Social Security aware that on 22 August she answered questions from Senators Harradine and Gietzelt by giving assurances that income derived from personal exertion of a <span class="highlight">child</span> would not be included in an income test for family allowancesassurances quite unrelated to any specific amount? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, does she agree with the decision that has been taken by the Government in respect of taxing incomes of children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, is she saying that two million Australian families will now be under continual scrutiny by this Government as to how much any <span class="highlight">child</span> in a family may earn? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those replies she said that the legislation to give effect to the Government’s Budget policy on <span class="highlight">child</span> employment was then being prepared. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, because of the concern that has been expressed in the community the Government has reviewed the decision and will make it clear when drawing up the legislation that it does not intend to include in the means testing arrangement income which results from the personal exertion of the <span class="highlight">child</span> concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>However, because of the concern that has been expressed in the community the Government has reviewed the decision and will make it clear when drawing up the legislation that it does not intend to include in the means testing arrangement income which results from the personal exertion of the <span class="highlight">child</span> concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are not necessarily for incorporation in this program;  I  was looking at the program that is conducted through my Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall start by pointing out that the family allowance was introduced in August 1976 as a replacement for the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment scheme and the tax rebates which were available in respect of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and tax rebate schemes which previously existed were both a recognition of the fact that to rear a <span class="highlight">child</span> costs money and that families with children, whether they are rich or poor families, had expenses associated with <span class="highlight">child</span> rearing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore the Government, through the Taxation Office, recognised those expenses and allowed a rebate and, through the Department of Social Security, also recognised those disadvantages and paid <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much was made in that debate of the fact that the new family allowance was a recognition of the work of the mother in the home- inadequate as that recognition may have been- and was an important part payment to a mother to assist her in rearing a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has never been suggested, since <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment was introduced or since the family allowance scheme was introduced, that these payments should be considered a pension in any sense of the word and available only to those who pass a certain means test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were payments in recognition of the fact that it costs money to rear children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this year’s Budget there was an extraordinary proposal- the income of the <span class="highlight">child</span> for whose benefit the allowance was paid was to be subject to an income test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On any reading of  Hansard  it can be seen that the Minister gave assurances- whatever the Minister may say now- that income derived from the personal exertion of the <span class="highlight">child</span> would not be considered part of the income test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A widow who has two or three children and who is receiving the widow’s pension is at present, as Professor Henderson has pointed out many times, some $20 below the poverty Une in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one of her children earned $30 a week by working weekends in a supermarket, which many children do- I know children who do this- she would in fact lose her family allowance for that <span class="highlight">child</span>, she would be forced further below the poverty line than she was before and the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s efforts to assist his mother to achieve a more reasonable level of income would be defeated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the first <span class="highlight">child</span> earns sufficient money to cause the family allowance received by his mother for him to be eliminated, it would seem from the answers given by the Minister in the past that the second <span class="highlight">child</span> will attract a family allowance of only $3.50 a week instead of $5 a week and the family allowance for the third <span class="highlight">child</span> will be reduced to $5 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, a mother of three children who has one <span class="highlight">child</span> who becomes ineligible for the family allowance will lose not only the $3.50 a week in respect of that <span class="highlight">child</span> but also $2.50 a week in respect of the next two children, who will become respectively the first and second children instead of the second and third children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Minister’s own words the proposal is that the mother will lose her allowance next year- after 1 January- in respect of income which was earned by the <span class="highlight">child</span> between July 1977 and June 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, from July 1977 to June 1978 a <span class="highlight">child</span> may have been earning $20, $25 or $30 a week completely unaware that in the 1978-79 Budget the Government would introduce a proposal which would deprive his mother of part or all of her family allowance in 1979, depending on what was earned from July 1977 to June 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happens to the <span class="highlight">child</span> who earns, say, $30 or $25 a week when he is 15 and who at the end of that year leaves school, earns an income and therefore is not eligible to attract a family allowance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this mean that the family of the <span class="highlight">child</span> who is in his last year at school will get the full family allowance when he is 1 5 years of age and that the following year that family would not be affected because the <span class="highlight">child</span> would no longer be eligible for the family allowance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, that <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s family would have a considerable advantage over the family whose <span class="highlight">child</span> continues at school for two or more years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, a <span class="highlight">child</span> who earned $40 or $30 a week in 1977-78 will be responsible for his mother losing in 1979 at least $3.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She will lose that if he is the first <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> may not be able to earn the same amount of income in 1979 or he may consider it better not to do so if his mother is to lose the family allowance in 1 980 as a result of his earning income in 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The family may decide to forgo the family allowance because of the <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alternatively- this unfortunately will happen- the family may decide not to declare the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also worth mentioning in passing that the Minister gave as the reason for putting a limit of $20 a week on a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s income before he or she will lose any family allowance that this would bring the amount into line with the limit for pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were introduced as a result of a recommendation of Professor Henderson’s Commission of Inquiry into Poverty to bring more equity into the old system of tax rebates and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tax deductions for dependent children were taken away from the breadwinner- traditionally the manand an approximately equivalent sum of money was transferred in an accounting process so that the mothers of Australia received an income which related to the fact that they were mothers looking after children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now to reduce the mother’s income because of the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s income seems to be the most hopeless muddle of thinking on what a family allowance is about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We keep on hearing- we heard it for far too long from  Senator Grimes;  he should not have spent so much time on it- that this matter relates to a <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The family allowance is not income for the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, we are pursuing a situation where a <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s income will reduce the mother’s income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Grimes  has done a lot of worthwhile work on how this decision will affect individual families and what the realities of income reduction will be, but I suggest with the greatest of respect to him that he would make a more worthwhile contribution to the debate, and certainly one which would have more relevance to the women of Australia, if he recognised that the mother’s allowance is to be penalised because of the <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless too much emphasis has been placed in this chamber on the subject of the <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hear the argument that because a <span class="highlight">child</span> gets an income somewhere else, the mother has to be penalised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we go back further than 22 August, which is the date that has been the subject of most of the discussion, we find, firstly, that it was announced on the Tuesday night that the Budget was brought down that the Government would be taking into consideration the reduction of family allowances where the income of a <span class="highlight">child</span> was in excess of $312 a year and that it would be done on the basis of income in the previous year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It meant any income of a <span class="highlight">child</span> from whatever source it originated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The change that was announced by the Treasurer last night takes into account the separate net income of the <span class="highlight">child</span> concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such income is different from the personal exertion income that may be gained by a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was the introduction of a means test on family allowances aimed principally at wealthy children who receive an unearned income through inherited property or through devices such as income splitting by trusts? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it possible to means test these people without discouraging enterprising children, many of whom are from low income families? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What would be the cost to revenue of exempting from the family allowance means test any income earned by the personal endeavour of the dependent <span class="highlight">child</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government introduced the means test on children’s income after reflecting on the fact that the family allowance scheme replaced the tax rebate which had previously been given to parents for a dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Hamer  ‘s question related to the justification of applying it to the <span class="highlight">child</span> of a wealthy family who is receiving an income from family income splitting, from trust accounts and from investments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister say whether a clear distinction might be drawn between earnings obtained by a <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s own efforts and earnings from sources which do not require direct effort on the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s part? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only a simple change was necessary to make family allowances liable to a means test if a <span class="highlight">child</span> or children received UNEARNED income above a certain level, as would be the case with a trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to speak on the matter that was raised during Question Time concerning the taxing- that  is  the only word I can use, although it is not quite accurate- of children’s earnings from personal exertion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter has been dealt with in the past, when the proposition was that any income over $315 a year earned by a <span class="highlight">child</span> by selling newspapers, collecting a few bottles, doing odd jobs at the local store or working on Saturday morning would deprive his mother from receiving in full the family allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time it was considered by various speakers that any attempt by the Government to place a test on income earned by children through personal exertion was mean, pennypinching and immoral in the true sense of the term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet in the House this morning the Minister said: ‘Yes we have decided that that was bad, but now we have lifted the amount a <span class="highlight">child</span> may earn from $6 a week to $20 a week’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Personal exertion on the part of children in order to support their families in difficult circumstances is in some way to limit the family allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Social Security came into this place some weeks ago and, under questioning, gave a firm assurance that the Government would not persist with taxing earnings derived by a <span class="highlight">child</span> from personal exertion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She clearly and sincerely informed the House that the situation regarding the income derived from the personal exertion of the <span class="highlight">child</span> would not be taken into consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many children participate in some activity to support the family income and $20 a week is really only a small amount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is what children could earn quite easily on a Saturday morning by delivering newspapers or magazines, or doing a variety of jobs or messages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What will the Government do to children under this legislation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not talking about interest from trusts or interest from shares which may have been lodged in a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s name for some tax evasion purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about money which the children physically earn themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be abhorrent to everyone in this place that the Government should attempt in some way to limit those earnings and to take some of them away from the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the children who are earning a few dollars are concerned, this proposal means that some of their earnings will be taken away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an attack on the family allowance of a mother through her <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us see what happens when the legislation is introduced and the Government has to take a vote on this change in policy which proposes that the income that a <span class="highlight">child</span> may earn without affecting the family allowance is to be increased from $6 to $20 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today, again at my request, an officer from the Parliamentary Library sought from the Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care figures relating to the expenditure by government on <span class="highlight">child</span> care since 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 also sought to obtain a breakdown of this expenditure as between full day care and other forms of <span class="highlight">child</span> care which are funded by the Federal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care told the Parliamentary Library officer that the Office could not provide this information to the Parliamentary Library. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through you,  Mr President,  I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate: What is the significance of this advice being given today by the Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care to an officer of the Parliamentary Library? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But since the question raises serious matters concerning information that perhaps can be obtained from three areas mentioned by her- the Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care, which apparently had some information and therefore it is a matter for the Department of Social Security, the Public Service Board and the Parliamentary Library itself- all that I can do is direct the attention of the appropriate authorities to those areas and see what information can be given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Martin  pointed out in her speech last week, the family allowance scheme was simply a trade-off for the loss of tax rebate and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact in the year in which family allowances replaced the tax rebate and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment scheme, it was estimated that the new system of family allowances would cost an additional $785m a year but that that amount would be balanced by the wiping out of the tax rebate and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to have incorporated in  Hansard  a comparison between the tax rebate and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment scheme and the family allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even under the old scheme which was inadequate and when the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment had not been indexed, a family with six children would have been $7.43 a week better off than under the new family allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next year is the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend to the Government for its consideration the problems and stresses of families with children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, under the migrant education program, provision has been made for <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education through the Schools Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assistance will be provided to both government and non-government school authorities for teaching materials, salaries and administration in respect of <span class="highlight">child</span> migrants and adult migrants, and extending to refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem of isolated children is one with which the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts has had a great deal of association because of its inquiry into the education of isolated children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An amount of $ 14.6m has been provided this year for education assistance for isolated children, which is an increase of $10.5m over the 1977-78 figure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of this increase some 20,000 children will be assisted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Additional amounts have been provided for the Northern Territory and, as promised in the 1977 policy speech of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  an additional $ 100 per <span class="highlight">child</span> is payable under the isolated children’s program to families living in certain tax zones whose children are eligible for basic boarding allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He pointed out- and my own experience has led me to confirm this-that there is in the world of educators today a growing volume of support for the idea that the most important area in education is that of the primary school or early childhood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The school and the teacher in these areas assume a strong place in the life of a young <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last few years there has been a pre-occupation with secondary and postsecondary education, but today, from my own observations and from my reading, I am of the view that there is growing support for this early childhood sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed it has been stated from time to time that the school teacher must be not only the school teacher but also the parent and that in the evolution of the <span class="highlight">child</span> towards adulthood, marriage and parenthood there must be an understanding of the role of education as well as the role and influence of schools and teachers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>About 60 per cent of Aboriginal people in Central Australia over 60 years of age are blind and 30 per cent of Aboriginal children under 1 1 years of age have trachoma. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the lack of preventive medical services and health services, on average urban Aboriginal children cost the Government hundreds of dollars a year per <span class="highlight">child</span> in remedial medical costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During  Senator Harradine  ‘s speech he said that the claim made during the winter recess that the family allowance for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> was to be abolished in the Budget was a furphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the Minister has made a block fund allocation to the States for <span class="highlight">child</span> care services in women’s refuges? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will she consider allocating money directly to the Canberra women’s refuge for <span class="highlight">child</span> care purposes, or will funds be allocated to that refuge for that purpose from the funds allocated to New South Wales for <span class="highlight">child</span> care purposes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact that I have made grants to State governments and the Northern Territory as a contribution towards facilities for <span class="highlight">child</span> care in women’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the information I sought regarding expenditure by the Department of Social Security on <span class="highlight">child</span> care and the numbers of public servants under the staff ceilings policy, which I sought from the Public Service Board, was published or publishable information and therefore should have been available automatically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The imposition of a means test on a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s income, which has now been withdrawn, showed among other things an appalling lack of awareness and sensitivity on the part of the Government of how lower income families live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children’s services, already grossly inadequate, have had their funds reduced by  5lA  per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of Social Security (Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care) again funds are not available for the actual running costs of women ‘s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time I interjected and said that we can insist, I suppose, that they stay inside their four walls and become another drug statistic, a potential suicide or a <span class="highlight">child</span> basher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was confused, for instance, about the means test which was to apply to the family allowances of families where the children receive an income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then the Minister for Social Security  (Senator  Guilfoyle)  came into this chamber and assured us that the Government was reviewing the situation and that the means testing of the children’s income did not- I repeat, did notapply to income derived from personal exertion by the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last week the Minister came into the chamber and said that the Government had reviewed the situation and decided that the children’s allowance would be penalised at the rate of $ 1 in every $4 where the <span class="highlight">child</span> earned in excess of $20 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is established, for instance, when a <span class="highlight">child</span> is perhaps 10 years of age, there may be a 15-year time limit, or the terms of the trust might state that while interest accrues the money remains in the trust and is not available until the <span class="highlight">child</span> turns 25 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this was the purpose of the Government’s proposal to tax the income of children why cannot it do so at either of those times? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a somewhat derisive way a Labor Party honourable senator interjected, ‘How is the <span class="highlight">child</span> care going?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where the review form is returned in time to be processed prior to 26 December 1978 indicating that the <span class="highlight">child</span> will be continuing full-time education in 1979, there will be no interruption to family allowance payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-65-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if the review form is not returned in time to be processed by 26 December 1978, payment of family allowance will then be suspended but arrears will be paid back to 26 December if the form is subsequently returned indicating that the <span class="highlight">child</span> will be continuing full-time education in 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-65-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Every man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> in this country is being mortgaged by the Fraser Government to these massive repayments of overseas capital as a direct result of  Mr Fraser  ‘s policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The allowance was the same for a married person with a dependent spouse and one <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have chosen to use a married person with a dependent spouse and one <span class="highlight">child</span> as a convenient example to show what a married person would receive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Minister gave figures about post-graduate awards this morning he used the example of a married person with a dependent spouse and two children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1959 both the single person and the married person with a dependent spouse and one <span class="highlight">child</span> received 65.4 per cent of average weekly earnings when they received their post-graduate awards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1978 we have now reached the stage where the single person’s allowance is $4,200 a year and a married person who has a dependent spouse and one <span class="highlight">child</span> receives an allowance of $6,222.80 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a proportion of average weekly earnings that amount is now 37.5 per cent for the single person and 55.5 per cent for the married person with a dependent spouse and one <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also noted with interest that  Senator Carrick  quoted the figures for the post graduate award holder who is married and has one <span class="highlight">child</span>, but he omitted to quote the far more important figure for the single post graduate award holder, for which the discrepancy in the figures is considerably different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The provisions of the Bill cover the following: Indexation of pensions and benefits; age pensions for persons aged 70 or more; rationalisation of payments for children; family allowances, including handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance and double orphan’s pension; maternity allowance; and payments of benefits in respect of children living abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance of $15 a week is payable to parents or guardians in respect of a <span class="highlight">child</span> under the age of 16 years who is cared for at home and who, because of the severity of the handicap, is in need of constant care and attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subject to the discretion of the DirectorGeneral, a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance is also payable, wholly or in part, where a person has the custody, care and control of a substantially handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> and, as a consequence of continuing substantial expenditure associated with the <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s disability, the person suffers financial hardship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In order to make provisions regarding children uniform the Government has also decided that the upper age limit of 25 years for payment of family allowance and double orphan’s pension will also apply to payment of additional pension and additional unemployment or sickness benefit for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill therefore proposes to remedy this deficiency by giving the Director-General discretion to apportion payments on such basis as he determines where he is satisfied that two persons are each qualified to receive payment in respect of the same <span class="highlight">child</span> at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, where parents living permanently apart have joint custody of, or joint access to, a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provisions in the Social Services Act currently enable family allowance, including handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance and double orphan’s pension, and additional pension or supporting parent’s benefit or additional unemployment or sickness benefit for children to be paid for a <span class="highlight">child</span> living abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of this the Bill provides that such payments will not in future be made for children outside Australia unless: A <span class="highlight">child</span> is temporarily abroad; a <span class="highlight">child</span> is living abroad pending migration to Australia within four years after the commencement of the benefit; and in respect of additional pension/benefit a <span class="highlight">child</span> is living abroad with a person who is himself receiving an Australian pension or benefit overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provision has been made for the imposition of an upper age limit for the payment of additional pension in respect of student children who are in the care, custody and control of service pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the Government’s view that the <span class="highlight">child</span> of a service pensioner will have had sufficient time to embark upon and complete his full time education and attain appropriate qualifications to facilitate entry into a chosen vocation by the time he attains 25 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to the Government that a pensioner or beneficiary who has three or four children will lose about $30 in the first year because of the changeover to the new system of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they should have a <span class="highlight">child</span> they will lose their maternity allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, the change to the definition of a <span class="highlight">child</span> to an upper limit of 25 years seems quite reasonable on the surface, but what will be its effects? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prime Minister Fisher, in introducing legislation providing for the payment of maternity allowances in 1912, pointed out that it would be of use to the women of that time to obtain credit where they wanted credit and to meet the expenses associated with the birth of a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance is at the rate of $ 1 5 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under some conditions it is also payable to persons who have custody, care and control of handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may seem to a lot of people that a fairly paltry sum is involved; but let me assure you,  Mr Acting Deputy President,  that there are any number of mothers in the community who find it a most welcome relief to be able to afford a few essentials- not luxuries- that are always associated with the birth of a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that any <span class="highlight">child</span> should be discriminated against. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it happened to be twins, triplets of quintuplets that the mother gave birth to, each of those children should have been regarded as an individual <span class="highlight">child</span> for the purpose of the maternity allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps it escaped the attention of the Government when it was framing this legislation- I remind honourable members opposite of this fact now- that it will become operative in November of this year, and 1979 just happens to be the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a whole year governments throughout the world will be endeavouring to enhance the lives of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find the Government taking away a few paltry dollars when a mother has a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be an extra special celebration because it will also be the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, it is the intention of the group which is organising WA ‘79’, as it is known, to issue a special birth certificate to every <span class="highlight">child</span> who is born in 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it discriminates against the children who are born in late 1978 or early 1980. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I am quite sure that, given the opportunity to choose the majority of mothers to be in that State, and in every other State and the two Territories, would prefer to receive a maternity allowance than to receive a special birth certificate signifying the birth of their <span class="highlight">child</span> in that year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we have a system which was introduced as a trade-off for the previous system of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To cut a long story short, a family with five children is now worse off by $8 a week by way of loss of purchasing power than it was in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Grimes also required information for the Opposition with regard to family allowances for children living abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I state briefly that family allowances will continue to be paid for children outside Australia where the <span class="highlight">child</span> is temporarily absent or the <span class="highlight">child</span> is living abroad pending migration to Australia and will arrive in Australia within four years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Family allowances will cease to be payable for children who have never been in Australia and who do not intend to migrate to Australia within four years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be no change in the arrangements for payment of family allowances for children who are already in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Briefly, that is the outline of the changes with regard to family allowances for children abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also sought information for the Opposition with regard to the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I state again briefly that this Bill extends eligibility for the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance to full-time children up to the age of 25 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance ceases at the age of 16 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill brings the position of handicapped students into line with other provisions of the Act relating to student children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this case the change arose from representations that were made of actual cases where a benefit would be achieved for a <span class="highlight">child</span> who was able to receive the allowance for that extended time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clause has been introduced because the family allowance scheme is a family allowance for children living within Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clause gives effect to the Government’s decision to withdraw additional payments for children outside Australia unless the <span class="highlight">child</span> is temporarily absent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an opportunity here for discretion to be exercised with regard to temporary absence and the allowance will continue to be paid where the <span class="highlight">child</span> is living abroad pending migration to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This covers the situation mentioned by  Senator Grimes,  provided that <span class="highlight">child</span> will arrive in Australia within four years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a family allowance scheme of the Government for Australian children and it will continue to be paid in cases of temporary absence or where the <span class="highlight">child</span> will arrive within four years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding is that this provision does not refer only to family allowances; it refers also to allowances for children of pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have a <span class="highlight">child</span> whom they send home to country Z because they feel it is the best place for that <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What sort of criteria is the Director-General of Social Services going to use when under these circumstances he stops the payment for the <span class="highlight">child</span> of a pensioner? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have some philosophical difficulties about a country such as Australia that actively encourages migrants, has them working and paying taxes and then, because one of their children happens to be living out of the country, deprives them of benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">child</span> goes overseas with a pensioner that <span class="highlight">child</span> is entitled to the payment until he or she reaches 25 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a payment that was never made to children in this category until 1976 when the family allowance scheme was introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were talking about paying an allowance for children who had never been in Australia and who would not be brought to Australia in the foreseeable future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have put in this clause the proviso that where a <span class="highlight">child</span> is temporarily absent and where there is migration pending within four years the allowance will be paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When this provision was introduced in 1 976 it had this open approach that a <span class="highlight">child</span> who may never come to Australia would have an allowance paid on his behalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I give an assurance that the new provision is not intended to cause hardship and that a <span class="highlight">child</span> who is temporarily absent from Australia can be covered with compassion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The exclusion of children who are living overseas and who may never come to Australia is thought to be a reasonable amendment to this clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  what would happen in the case of a migrant family settled in Australia which has left one <span class="highlight">child</span> in its home country because of an affliction of some kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the <span class="highlight">child</span> may be blind and the family did not wish the <span class="highlight">child</span> to leave its environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator GUILFOYLE (Victoria-Minister for Social Security)- (2.45)-If the <span class="highlight">child</span> had not been to Australia the family would not be able to receive an allowance for him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the Director-General may decide not to accept that a person intended to bring a <span class="highlight">child</span> back to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, a person making an appeal could say: ‘I intended to bring the <span class="highlight">child</span> back and the Director-General was wrong in saying that I did not intend to bring the <span class="highlight">child</span> back’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person could prove to the appeals tribunal that he intended to bring the <span class="highlight">child</span> back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as the case may be, of the <span class="highlight">child</span> or children in relation to whom the first-mentioned person is the supporting parent and that that person has taken such action to obtain such maintenance as the Director-General considers reasonable . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding the repeal effected by sub-section ( 1 ), Part V of the Principal Act continues to apply in relation to the birth of a <span class="highlight">child</span> that occurred before the commencement of this section. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding the repeal effected by sub-section ( 1 ), Part V of the Principal Act continues to apply in relation to the birth of a <span class="highlight">child</span> that occurred before the commencement of this section. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They introduce a new concept into those sections of the Social Services Act which deal with <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These clauses prohibit the payment of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment on behalf of children who are recipents of any of these scholarships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think all honourable senators have had letters from groups and individuals who will be quite severely affected by this provision, particularly those in country areas who have children living in cities and trying to study at tertiary institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 24 (<span class="highlight">Child</span> endowment). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Clause 24 changes the payment of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment from every four weeks to every month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although we do not oppose the change we merely point out that in the first year, which includes the payment date of 1 5 May, there will be a loss to parents with three or four children, which would I think include most parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that when my children- I am sure this applies to the majority of honourable senators who have children- contracted measles the doctor was not contacted as it was known that measles was a relatively minor complaint, a children’s complaint, that could be coped with quite well at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the parents would decide whether the <span class="highlight">child</span> needed medical attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw to the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs the publication of a pamphlet entitled ‘Declaration of the Rights of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>- a present for you from a Palestinian <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware of the existence of this pamphlet and of the fact that it bears the official symbol of the United Nations campaign for the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>is the Minister concerned that the disturbing and inaccurate allegations made in the pamphlet may gain some respectability due to their misleading presentation and that this, in turn, will decrease the credibility of the official International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> campaign which Australia supports? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware of the existence of the pamphlet because I and my Department are closely associated with the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having seen it and viewing it now, I note, as all honourable senators would, that the official symbol of the United Nations International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> has been incorporated in the pamphlet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am concerned that the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> campaign should not be used in ways other than those intended by the United Nations and by Australia’s participation in the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators know, the Commonwealth Government fully supports the promotion of <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare, which is the main purpose of the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>, and would be concerned at any action which would tend to compromise the credibility of the campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question to the Minister for Education relates to an answer he gave earlier concerning his Department ‘s involvement in the Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: In view of his obvious interest in the Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>, and presumably his Government’s equal interest, will he take action, in schools under his authority in the Australian Capital Territory at least, to have the practice of corporal punishment under any regulations or ordinances within the Australian Capital Territory abolished? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-It is very true that I, as Minister for Education, have a significant responsibility, which I welcome, in terms of the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be very happy to take to the Australian Education Council the wider concept that we should all look- I am sure most teachers do- to the minimisation of any witting or unwitting traumatic experience upon the student <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the Minister for Social Security noted the appeal by Professor Ken Turner, director of the research unit at Perth’s Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, for a national conference to discuss the 73 separate theories that have been advanced as the cause of cot deaths? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Minister that 1979 is the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister to take this initiative to ensure that during the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> some positive steps are taken which will have lasting benefits for the children of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will refer it to the Minister for Health, and in consultation with him and with other Commonwealth and State Ministers, who have formed a committee to deal with national projects for International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>, I will see that the suggestion is subjected to examination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I accept, as  Senator Keeffe  has said, that this is an opportunity to have a wide examination of all the theories that have been noted with regard to these distressing deaths of very young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, will the Government consider the access to legal aid by non-profit incorporated bodies, such as <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, which are at present ineligible to receive legal aid and which are put to a great disadvantage if sued by an individual person of poor means who has full access to legal aid? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The particular case that  Senator Teague  mentions is concerned with a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre being sued, presumably as a result of some injury being caused to a <span class="highlight">child</span> at that centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the recommendation of the Council, the Bill clarifies the authority of a person under a warrant directing him to take possession of a <span class="highlight">child</span> who has been the subject of a custody order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The family allowance for student children aged 1 6 years and over will be continued up to 26 December of this year, in all cases under the usual conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A review form will be posted before the end of November to all mothers of student children in this category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where the review form that is returned indicates that the <span class="highlight">child</span> will be continuing full time education and is received in time to process the January payment, there will be no break in the continuity of payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To celebrate that event  Senator Ryan  and those honourable senators who would support her motion suggest that this Government should be the first government in Australia to set up a public abortion clinic in the grounds of a hospital to be run by the taxpayers’ money to destroy the lives of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is that the message that the Senate wants to give to other nations of the world as Australia’s answer to the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> applies not only to the born but also to the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It says that a <span class="highlight">child</span> by reason of its physical and mental immaturity needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection both before as well as after binh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely those people who believe in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights would not be pulled away from the Declaration of the Rights of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have letters that are heartrending- letters written by six-year-old or seven-year-old children and sent by their parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She pleaded with me that just as no pro-abortionist should force anybody to have an abortion, what are the rights of the anti-abortionists to force a woman to carry a <span class="highlight">child</span> against her wishes when there are legal alternatives? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They talk about killing children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What sort of a person would want to kill a <span class="highlight">child</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is easy for people to say that abortion means killing a <span class="highlight">child</span>, but where are these people when these questions have to be answered and what are their answers to these questions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When they resort to having pimply-faced boys of 1 5 years of age standing outside hospitals and screaming at some anxious woman that she is murdering her <span class="highlight">child</span> their morality is very much in question and they are finding the answers far too easy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The time to examine that freedom, the time to take that responsibility, is before they have intercourse, before there is any likelihood of a <span class="highlight">child</span> eventuating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have six children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I expect governments to legislate to protect me from charlatans, rogues and exploiters and to promote a good life for my children, and I will make the decision about whether I should have children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recognise readily that a woman in circumstances of not wanting to have a <span class="highlight">child</span> has a right to freedom of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I begin by stating what must seem to be almost stupidly trite: No <span class="highlight">child</span> asks to be born. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">child</span> is born through an act of two other people and not by an act ofthe <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in relation to that <span class="highlight">child</span> the term ‘right to life’ means that he should not be lonely, oppressed, diseased, underprivileged, hungry, orphaned, battered by drunken parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children have a right to life and a right to love. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like them to commit themselves to devoting an equal proportion of their time, of their vigour, of their ability and of their wit to caring for the children in orphanages and children who are poor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those people who are sincere in campaigning against abortion should examine the way in which their time is apportioned and decide whether at least half of their time ought not to be devoted to the fostering of children from Asia- the children who are orphaned and the children whom I described earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a perfect society those children of unwanted pregnancies- I am not suggesting that every unwanted pregnancy produces an unwanted <span class="highlight">child</span>, but certainly a massive number of them do- would obtain the love, the care and the nourishment that other children receive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the six-year-old and seven-year-old children who have written to me in language, as was suggested by  Senator Mason,  which amounts to committing one of the most obscene acts that I have experienced in a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot imagine a six-year-old <span class="highlight">child</span> ever recovering from that kind of a blow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is stated that the courses should be conducted by trained suitable teachers and that parents not wishing their <span class="highlight">child</span> to take part in such courses should be allowed to contract out in writing on their <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s behalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must admit that  Senator Walters  confused me dreadfully by her specious’argument this afternoon about the Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> and how honourable senators would start that important year by murdering children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator said in effect that we should not be worrying about ultra-sound scans as they were too expensive although they may in actual fact determine whether something is wrong with a foetus that is about to become a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator may not be aware but a foetus is an unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But now she is expressing her concern for the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes the reasons are purely and simply that women recognise that they cannot give the necessary emotional support either to a <span class="highlight">child</span> or to another <span class="highlight">child</span> in their family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes they are concerned that they do not have enough love to give to their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes they already have too many children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some women are so emotionally drained that they know that they cannot cater for the needs of a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did it on the basis that many years ago I recognised notonly that women have a right to determine what they should do with their bodies but also that there was a consideration for the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> to be taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me the most important consideration is whether a woman feels that she can have a <span class="highlight">child</span> and give it the love, the affection and the financial assistance that it is going to need- the emotional support service right through its life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I told the Right To Life people that I had heard of cases such as that of a pregnant deserted mother with a <span class="highlight">child</span> of about three years of age whose husband has disappeared and where there is no doubt that he is not coming back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be a situation where a girl has had an abortion, often for good reasons- mostly for good reasons- but it can happen that she may have her ovaries removed in another operation and have pangs of regret that she did not have the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whosoever unlawfully administers to or causes to be taken by any woman, whether with <span class="highlight">child</span> or not, any drug or noxious thing or unlawfully uses any instrument or other means with intent in any such case to procure a miscarriage shall be liable to penal servitude for ten years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everybody here knows that unwanted children continue to be the victims of <span class="highlight">child</span> abuse and worse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Staff who wish to take leave around the time of the birth of the <span class="highlight">child</span> will still have available to them other forms of leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the present provisions, staff can receive more than 12 weeks pay if the actual date of birth of the <span class="highlight">child</span> is later than the expected date of birth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most important of these concern, firstly, the new section 7- inserted by clause 8 of the Bill- which will enable an employee to continue to work closer than 6 weeks before the expected date of confinement provided the leave officer agrees and a medical certificate is provided; a similar provision will enable an employee to resume duty earlier than 6 weeks after the birth of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This change will, for example, enable a mother whose <span class="highlight">child</span> is hospitalised after premature birth to return to work should she so desire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It knew how many were unemployed right to the man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> over 16 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Generally speaking, since I was a <span class="highlight">child</span> living in the Northern Territory, the Aboriginal infant mortality rate, which was then in the hundreds per thousand, has dropped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We go to tremendous measures to protect the life of a single <span class="highlight">child</span>; why do we not take similar measures to protect the lives of hundreds of children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in stark contrast to our debate last Thursday when we were debating the rights of the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now we seem to have evidence that we are neglecting the life of the <span class="highlight">child</span> itself, especially the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a problem that becomes more serious as the <span class="highlight">child</span> becomes older. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I recognise the genuine concern of  Senator Georges  in this matter but I doubt that money can really buy the health of the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many young girls in the outback who are having their first <span class="highlight">child</span> are very far from medical attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister representing the Treasurer aware that the levying of sales tax on equipment or toys that aid in the development of mentally or physically handicapped children places a heavy financial burden on the parents of those children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government consider waiving sales tax on such equipment and toys, when purchased upon the recommendation of a doctor, having in mind that the educative nature of the equipment or toy is essential for the development of the <span class="highlight">child</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it not a fact that the records of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations show that extended weekend trading patterns already have caused a substantial loss of full time jobs in the retail trade and increased bankruptcy of small businesses in favour of increased casualisation of the industry and attempted exploitation of <span class="highlight">child</span> labour by certain major chain stores? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we as a people cannot harness technological change and a shorter working week to satisfactorily employ every man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> who wants a job, there is something wrong with us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister bring to the attention of  Mr Ramsay  the fact that <span class="highlight">child</span> labour was largely eradicated over 100 years ago? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I again ask: Before promising support for employers to abolish weekend penalty rates, what guarantees did the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations obtain from employers to safeguard permanent jobs, to prevent exploitation of <span class="highlight">child</span> labour, to protect small service businesses from bankruptcy and to ensure additional jobs which would be suitable at least for some of the hundreds of thousands of people seeking full time jobs, 291,000 of whom are in receipt of the unemployment benefit? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that families should have assistance on the occasion of the birth of a <span class="highlight">child</span> and there are many ways in which such assistance can be provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Education further claimed as some sort of justification that staff who wish to take leave around the time of the birth of a <span class="highlight">child</span> would have available to them other forms of leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody in the Senate who has been in a home at the time of the birth of a new baby could not possibly claim that a young father who has to cope with two or three other children, a new baby and a wife who may not be 100 per cent fit is taking leave for recreational purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I pass now to the restrictions on maternity leave available to female public servants on the birth of a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government really believes that women should not be penalised in their employment for <span class="highlight">child</span> bearing, why does it propose that there be a 12-month qualifying period? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real difficulty for women going on maternity leave but who want and need to return to work within the qualifying period is the lack of proper <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, that is the case in the Australian Capital Territory yet the provision of <span class="highlight">child</span> care here is better, I believe, than in many other parts of Australia where Commonwealth employees work and would wish to return to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there were a proper and adequate national <span class="highlight">child</span> care program, so that a mother who was perfectly well could place her <span class="highlight">child</span> in proper care, care that she would be happy about, and return to work within the qualifying period, I would perhaps be sympathetic to the argument that such a person should not automatically be qualified to receive sick leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not the situation and, as a result of the lack of <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities and, now, the necessity for a woman to be really ill before she can use up her sick leave credits as well, we will see women returning to the work force, because they need to hold their jobs, before they are properly fit to do so, or have been able to make really satisfactory arrangements for their small babies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">child</span> is born late, the mother cannot return to work for six weeks and must forgo income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, the woman’s career prospects will, in fact, be damaged by <span class="highlight">child</span> bearing, which is something that the Government is supposed to wish not to happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If women cannot find satisfactory <span class="highlight">child</span> care or do not feel that they can return to work in the time now allotted, or if they have joined the Public Service too late to qualify for maternity leave, I think that many of them will have to resign from the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surveys show that 50 per cent of women do return to work after maternity leave despite the enormous difficulties of obtaining <span class="highlight">child</span> care for children under 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another example is a woman who takes maternity leave, comes back to the Public Service and takes maternity leave again to have another <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, I do not think that there are many cases of women who are actually making a career of producing children so as to qualify for maternity leave year after year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, there is a serious lack of <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities, particularly for very small children, which makes the provision of one year’s maternity leave for public servants not a totally satisfactory provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no provisions for easier entry into the work force for women who stay out of the work force until their children are of school age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like also to see the deletion of proposed new section 6 (3) (a) in clause 7(b), which standardises the payment of 12 weeks maternity leave, which must be taken in an inflexible way six weeks before the expected birth of a <span class="highlight">child</span> and six weeks after. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, to ensure the healthy delivery of a baby and to protect the health of the mother; and, secondly, to allow time to establish a parent-<span class="highlight">child</span> relationship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would put forward the view -I cannot believe that the Government would argue against it- that adopting parents need that second provision, the time to establish a relationship with a <span class="highlight">child</span>, just as much as natural parents do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To allow leave only to mothers who bear their own children is discriminatory against adopting parents, and I do not believe that there is any proper case for penalising adopting parents in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that she must have had her tongue in her cheek when she was talking about a week’s paternity leave to allow the father to get to know his newborn <span class="highlight">child</span> and at the same time look after the other children of the family while the mother is in hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It goes on to say that it is not necessary that only women should be eligible to care for the baby and that such a restriction serves only ‘to institutionalise the role of woman as <span class="highlight">child</span>-rearer and to reinforce stereotyped views’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is somewhat insulting to the resilience of the male members of the Australian Public Service to suggest that if they took some of their recreation leave at the time of the birth of the <span class="highlight">child</span> the loss of the holiday aspect of the leave at some later time is likely to have some serious affect on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Senator Guilfoyle  herself pointed out in her keynote address, the Government is giving close attention to the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> in 1981. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Children and young people watch television for about 20 hours a week or nearly three hours a day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Research has established that by the time some children leave school they will have spent more time in front of the home television screen than in the classroom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For the average Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> television viewing occupies more of his or her time than any other single activity apart from sleep. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were more concerned, however, with an estimated 20 per cent of children who view in excess of 30 and sometimes as high as 80 hours of television a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidence presented to the Committee showed that these children, because of certain social inhibitions, tended to retreat to a world of their own where television became virtually their sole companion and their main source of information and entertainment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These children are particularly vulnerable to the influence of television and the ones for which we have the greatest concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other witnesses argued that because television had the ability to monopolise so much of the average <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s time we should capitalise on this by offering programs that are informative and imaginative and in which the <span class="highlight">child</span> has some intellectual involvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the available evidence and from our own analysis of programs we concluded that much of the criticism directed at children’s programs offered by both the national and commercial services is well founded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that commercial television by its very nature is not geared to cater adequately for minority audiences including children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee has recommended that children’s programming be taken out of the arena of industry economics and that programs be produced by an independent production unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who advocated the urgent introduction of media educational courses in the schools pointed out that since television is such an important influence in the learning process, children should be taught discrimination in its use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was suggested that acquiring this skill was just as important in a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s training as reading, writing and language construction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic objective of media education is to train the <span class="highlight">child</span> to be an appreciative and critical viewer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of interest to note that as a result of our public hearings and those of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in its inquiry into selfregulation for broadcasters, a great deal of public interest has been generated in children’s television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With 1979 being designated as Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> by the United Nations, we expect this interest to be sustained and develop even further as community attention focuses more sharply on the needs of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the great amount of interest in this inquiry and likely continued public interest, I inform the Senate that we will be looking at the subject of children’s television again in about eighteen months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, one of the Committee’s findings, which were made on the basis of evidence put to it, was that the average viewing time which children spend watching television is of the order of 20 to 22 hours a week but one-fifth of the <span class="highlight">child</span> population of this country watches television for much longer than that- up to 60 to 70 hours a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to consider how much we as a parliament should be concerned about those children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not one that includes any grant made via the State for <span class="highlight">child</span> care, so I am unaware whether the figure  Senator Wriedt  cited includes a <span class="highlight">child</span> care component. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If it shows a total higher than that then there is an inclusion of some <span class="highlight">child</span> care components. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the assessment that she has just given, namely, that this year- to date anyway- the Tasmanian grant for pre-schools and <span class="highlight">child</span> care will be $1,054,000, and to the Budget allocation as shown in Budget Paper No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are we to assume now that Tasmania is to receive this financial year $lm less than last year’s allocation for pre-schools and <span class="highlight">child</span> care, which in effect will mean a 50 per cent cut in the allocation to Tasmania? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that in this International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> all Australian children be considered an equal part of this country’s wealth and that the Health Act be amended so that Pensioners Health Benefit Cards can be issued to those receiving Supporting Parents Benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In January 1979 on the occasion of opening the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>  Senator Guilfoyle  said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a rare opportunity to demonstrate that intensified public and governmental awareness of children’s needs can lead to concrete action of immense and, above all, lasting benefit to mankind’s future- its children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no sounder investment than the future of the <span class="highlight">child</span> and no greater responsibility for the adults of today . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The great and promising potentials of the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> require, deserve and depend upon the unreserved support of governments, organisations and individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we are talking about pensioners’ benefits we are also talking about children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are children of parents who are in receipt of unemployment benefits or who are in receipt of benefits of some sort from this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind all honourable senators that this is the Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> and there are many children in Australia who are hungry, who do not have adequate housing and who do not even have adequate clothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am simply saying that in this International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> there are in Australia many children who are hungry and who are not being housed or clothed properly because their parents happen to be in receipt of pensioner benefits from this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let’s look at a taxpayer with a spouse and dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> on average weekly earnings of $220.38. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This figure takes no account of the family allowance scheme which provides mothers with significantly higher benefits than the old <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another major and very familiar problem area is of course that of family law, where, as is quite well known, the High Court has held in the case of Russell and Russell that there are constitutional inhibitions on the Federal Family Court being able to deal with the full range of matters that can arise in matrimonial and particularly <span class="highlight">child</span> custody cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not being concentrated in the areas of greatest need and this lack of concentration effectively ruled out desirable measures such as the indexation of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the attention of the Minister for Social Security been drawn to the article in the Saturday evening  Mercury  of 24 February which ridicules the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> and underlines the journalist’s total ignorance of the aims of the United Nations and of this Government in celebrating that year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister indicate the damage that this type of irresponsible reporting does to the Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> and would she remind the media of the need for their co-operation in this regard? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think everyone would know that Australia, as a member of the United Nations, is joining in the celebration this year of the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great deal of work has been done by the Federal Government, by State governments and by the voluntary organisations in this country to make it a fitting year of celebration in recognition of the rights of children and of our responsibilities to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Articles may also be written which express the expectation that at the end of the year we will be able to say that we have solved all of the problems of our children or that we have discharged our responsibilities to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Tasmania, the State in which the article to which  Senator Walters  refers was written, a great deal of planning with regard to the Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> has been undertaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the media will give their support, as they have done previously, to the efforts of the governments and the people of this country to draw attention in this year to the needs and rights of children and our responsibilities to them, and to see that it is a year that is enjoyed by children in whatever way they are able to enjoy it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said that, I commend the celebrations of the Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> to everyone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was with regard to seeding grants for community groups for purposes of the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My attention has been drawn to the plight of one parent families, and in particular, to the differences which exist in the benefits paid to children who are under the auspices of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs and those cared for by the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware, for example, that a civilian widow with a <span class="highlight">child</span> of 14 years is paid a mere $66.70 a week, compared with $8 1 .70 received by a war widow in the same circumstances? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does she agree that it is indeed a deep injustice for such discrimination to exist between children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the Minister to the United Nations declaration which states that it is the fundamental right of all children to have equality of educational opportunities’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of this, will the Minister investigate the possibility of the children of civilian widows being paid an education allowance similar to that paid to the children of war widows? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does she agree that in so doing the justification for the Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> will be given more merit? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the Institute should explore a great variety of factors which bear on the desirability of the nuclear family which I think most historians and sociologists would say is a sort of bastard <span class="highlight">child</span> of the industrial revolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it would be desirable if in many of our policies relating to social issues more consideration were given to the situation which exists in more primitive societies than ours in which much more care and attention is given to the wider ramifications of family relationships than in the typical Australian family as it is sometimes described with a husband, a wife, two children and the television set. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The organisation and formulation of government policies- I make this comment irrespective of party lines- which bear on the family situation are very much structured towards encouraging the continuance of the nuclear family and against the possibility of encouraging wider and more supportive relationships in families which involve more than just a husband, a wife and two children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 62 is amended to extend the circumstances in which a court can order the parties to confer with a counsellor or can order a counsellor to report to it on the welfare of the children of the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This can now be done whenever the welfare of a <span class="highlight">child</span> under 1 8 is relevant (clause 9). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 1 1 widens the power of a court to issue a warrant expressed to apply to any vehicle, vessel, aircraft, premises or place where there is reasonable cause to believe that a <span class="highlight">child</span> the subject of a custody order may be found. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn briefly to the question of programming for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not simply because this is the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> that this matter requires our attention: It is because in the whole development of television, and, in particular, in the hearings that have been conducted by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, people in the community have expressed a greater degree of concern about children’s television than they have about anything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who have seen the attempts of certain members of the Broadcasting Tribunal to prevent similar submissions being made to the Sydney hearings, and the way in which the Tribunal has now decided that it will accept those submissions, will also be impressed with the number and the quality of the submissions relating to children’s television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn from the political response to the humanitarian response to the claims of the displaced families of Eritrea, the 1,200,000 persons who have been made homeless, of whom, in this International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>, 400,000 are thought to be children under 12 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the attention of the Attorney-General been drawn to the report that the Tasmanian  President  of the Printing and Kindred Industries Union has claimed that <span class="highlight">child</span> pornography is being printed in Australia using imported printing plates and that the Union has placed bans on all agencies connected with printing and publishing <span class="highlight">child</span> pornography? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, if any plates or publications featuring <span class="highlight">child</span> pornography are intercepted at the point of importation, they are seized because they are clearly prohibited under the customs regulations dealing with prohibited imports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to say that all State laws ban any publications relating to <span class="highlight">child</span> pornography. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They met on this matter and agreement was reached unanimously that <span class="highlight">child</span> pronography would be banned uniformly throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is important that publications featuring <span class="highlight">child</span> pornography are brought to the attention of the authorities and, as these plates are illegal, I would hope that anybody who has information about the existence of illegal material of this kind would notify the appropriate authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Attorney-General, relates to the closing in October last year of the <span class="highlight">child</span> minding service associated with the Family Court in Brisbane. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the AttorneyGeneral agree that when family law legislation was debated in this chamber, heavy stress was laid on the need to remove the strains which had been associated with divorce jurisdiction in the past, with particular reference to the rights of children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the Attorney-General agree that this <span class="highlight">child</span> minding service is a very valuable one, particularly when custody and access matters are being heard in view of the desirability of avoiding conflict between parents in the presence of children when custody of children is in dispute? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has he had reports of unfortunate incidents in the precincts of the Family Court in Brisbane since this <span class="highlight">child</span> minding service has been closed down, particularly when children have come into contact with parents from whom they have been separated for some time? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it true that staff are using the former <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centre for recreation purposes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was the closing of the <span class="highlight">child</span> minding service approved by the AttorneyGeneral, or was it approved by an officer of the Department, and if so, on what grounds? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Attorney-General give an assurance that this <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centre will be opened in the near future and will not be closed again under the same sort of circumstances? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 1941 debates when this legislation was first introduced into the Parliament we find that the purpose of introducing this revenue raising legislation was to finance <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The revenue was expected to raise something like 8m to service the financing of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment which was estimated to cost f 13m in the first year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Watson  has mentioned, payroll tax was introduced in April 1941 along with <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The board of the gaining school may consider enrolments from areas outside its own priority area provided that the effects on present and future accommodation capacity have been investigated; no responsibility is accepted or guarantees given in regard to provision of additional school bus transport; and parents seeking to transfer their <span class="highlight">child</span> are prepared to notify the principal of the school within their own designated priority area of their intention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the recently reported figures published by the Institute of Applied Economics and Social Research which indicate that a single parent with one <span class="highlight">child</span> requires $85.30 a week to live beyond the poverty line, and a single parent with two children requires $ 103.50 to escape poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Government review the case for a special education allowance for the children of single parent families? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government does expect parents to continue to meet part of their parental responsibilities with respect to student children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the premises on which the whole system is based is that in the majority of cases parents will not regard children who are still students as being no longer their responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Button  made the point that independence is not achieved until a person is 25 years of age whereas in fact independence can be established, for the purposes of the allowance on a number bases: Firstly, if a person is over 25 years of age; secondly, if a person is married or has been in a de facto relationship for two years or for only one year if there is a <span class="highlight">child</span>; thirdly, if a person is a ward of a State or an orphan; or, fourthly, if a person has been in the work force for two years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then to finalise the miscellaneous chapter, children are put in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One would have thought in this International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> that children would have had a special chapter of their own under the Queensland Aboriginal by-laws, but they do not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These children had received 14 days gaol in this dirty, filthy little dog-hole of a room because, allegedly, the 13-year-old <span class="highlight">child</span> had made a pass at one of the boys and the 1 1 yearold had said ‘damn’ to her teacher at school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is what those children were sentenced for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For example, since we acquired a colour television set I have noticed that my own young <span class="highlight">child</span> wants to watch it every morning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is difficult for parents to act in a way that would protect their children from false values and standards because the children are subjected to this not only in what they watch on television but also at the school canteen where the same sort of products are sold because a demand has been built up in the minds of impressionable children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I accept the sincerity of  Senator Baume  and the members of his Committee, but I think they have to analyse whether they should challenge the values that build up to that sort of situation which is detrimental to every individual who is subjected to this barrage of influence that makes it almost impossible for a <span class="highlight">child</span> to be protected from this heavy advertising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> we are doing a very grave disservice to our children, born and unborn, if we run the risk of using this type of herbicide in settled areas and, as far as I am concerned, in any area at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The problem of providing a balance of programs for children is dealt with in a most interesting Media Information publication entitled ‘Media and the <span class="highlight">Child</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a special issue this month to mark the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An article by Julie Bailey which is entitled ‘Regulatory Bodies and Children’s Television Committees’ makes this observation: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting to see a very detailed study by a German psychologist by the name of  Himmelweit  in a book entitled  Television and the <span class="highlight">Child</span>  in which she wrote: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Television plays a vital role in the process of socialisation as far as young children are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Norman Morris, in his book  Television’s <span class="highlight">Child</span>,  puts the responsibility of the broadcasters in the following terms: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I go back to another article in the Media Information Publication,  Media and the <span class="highlight">Child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That organisation publishes a number of compelling and interesting studies on the Australian media, its ownership, its control, its resources, the nature of programs and the effect of programs on children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, its special issue, which was published this month to mark the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>, draws together most of the valuable Australian and overseas work done on children and television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s brain is a fire to be ignited not a pot to be filled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The example was as follows: Assume a family of father, mother and three children, with the business having a net income of $40,000 before deducting the proprietor’s wages, and then consider the following changes which can be rung upon that scenario. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the business is owned by a company in which the shares are held on the following basis, the father one-third, the mother one-third and each <span class="highlight">child</span> one-ninth, and assuming that wages are paid out of $20,000 for the father, and $6,000 for the mother, the tax goes down to $13,707. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lastly, if the business is owned by a discretionary trust and $3,750- to take an example- is distributed during the year to each <span class="highlight">child</span>, or to a parent for each <span class="highlight">child</span>, and if the balance is then allocated at the end of the year equally between the father and the mother the tax on that $40,000 net income will be only $6,800. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the AttorneyGeneral whether he recalls my asking him approximately a month ago a question in relation to the provision of <span class="highlight">child</span> minding facilities at the Family Court in Brisbane. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he recall my asking him on what grounds those <span class="highlight">child</span> minding facilities were closed and asking questions relating to the detailing of hardship that this might have imposed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he also recall my asking him whether the area which had been previously used for <span class="highlight">child</span> minding was now being used for staff recreation purposes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I wish to add to an answer to a question that  Senator Martin  asked me earlier today about the closure of a <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centre at the Family Court of Australia in Brisbane. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact that the <span class="highlight">child</span> minding service at the Family Court in Brisbane was withdrawn at the end of November 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For each <span class="highlight">child</span>……….. 7.50 <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The maximum payable for a father with one <span class="highlight">child</span> paying rent is $69.70* a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Plus $2 if there is <span class="highlight">child</span> under 6 or invalid <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Means Test: Generally nothing payable if ‘liquid’ assets exceed $500 plus $ 100 for each <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The maximum rate is reduced by income above $18 per week, where there is one <span class="highlight">child</span> plus $6 a week for each subsequent <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any earned income in excess of $20 per week plus $6 per week for each <span class="highlight">child</span> reduces the maximum rate on a dollar for dollar basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The housing cost allowance of up to $25 per week (of which $20 is subject to discretion) is reduced by income in excess of $ 1 a week plus $6 per week for each <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has not said to the Victorian Government: ‘You have a large number of children in the western suburbs who will not get jobs because you say they are undertrained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a Victorian Government which is so responsible that it has set up yet another <span class="highlight">child</span> minding scheme in which young teenagers can be given cups of coffee and can talk to people on the telephone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has done nothing about providing the jobs that those children need so that they can take their proper place in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The work of the Conference reflected such important issues as disarmament, the Middle East situation, international terrorism, the fixing of fair prices for primary commodities, colonialism, and the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>, and of special interest to parliamentarians is the report on the ‘Violation of Human Rights of Parliamentarians’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The year 1979 is the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important for us during the course of this year to consider those areas in which there is discrimination against a <span class="highlight">child</span> not only in this country but also in other parts of the world where there are not laws to protect children in the same way as there are to protect adults. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Declaration of Rights of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> which was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 20 November 1959 was designed to provide that nations recognise that children as well as adults have rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But always those rights are concerned with adults and not, as a rule, with children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There does not appear to me to be, as I will indicate later, the legal protection afforded to children or the groups or individuals prepared to take up this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children, by the very nature of their age and their lack of maturity, are not competent to protect themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The brochure I have before me states that the <span class="highlight">child</span> should be: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, the Declaration emphasises that the <span class="highlight">child</span> shall be brought up in a spirit of understanding, tolerance, friendship among peoples, peace and universal brotherhood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas the <span class="highlight">child</span>, by reason of his physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> shall enjoy all the rights set forth in this Declaration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All children, without any exception whatsoever, shall be entitled to these rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that the Declaration intends to protect the <span class="highlight">child</span> in at least the same way as the adult would be protected; but we find that in our laws- fortunately this is not the case in the laws of many countries in the Western world- protection is not afforded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is remarkable that no law concerning <span class="highlight">child</span> cruelty was passed in the British Parliament until the Act of Parliament for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children was passed in 1899. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That year a society was formed for the prevention of cruelty to children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It took the British society that long to recognise that cruelty against children was as important as cruelty against animals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What amounts to moderation and reasonableness depends on all the circumstances including the nature of the offence, the age, sex and strength of the <span class="highlight">child</span>, his past behaviour and the kind of punishment inflicted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The article gives examples of how easily these so-called guidelines and regulations can be abused simply because there is no protection afforded to the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A relatively backward <span class="highlight">child</span> is made to stand in front of the class and repeatedly belted on the buttocks, with the teacher encouraging a sense of amusement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It demonstrates how easily these laws and regulations can be abused when insufficient protection is given to the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, as has been tested so many times in the courts, in the case of the striking of a minor by a schoolteacher, even by a parent, not only is the person doing the striking protected by the law but unless someone is prepared to do it for him, the <span class="highlight">child</span> is denied the opportunity to defend himself under our laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After reading that article and from conversations that I had with her I am convinced that she is a woman who did in fact understand the significance of what violence means to a <span class="highlight">child</span> in its formative years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only last week the Swedish Parliament, by 259 votes to 6 votes, passed the first draft of a Bill forbidding totally corporal punishment of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, I believe is the beginning of what will be a move in our own country towards ensuring that the rights of children are protected in the same way as the rights of adults are protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As 1979 is the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>, I hope that it will not pass with a series of sanctimonious statements about the welfare of children, but at least will result in concrete and positive steps being taken to protect the kids of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think  Senator Townley  overlooks the fact that the guidelines for eligibility for the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s allowance, introduced some time ago by the present Government, have been widened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the ways in which we are able to assist those parents with children who are handicapped and who have continuing expenditure is to review their financial circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the absence of the stricter guidelines which applied at the introduction of the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance, the Director-General of Social Security is able to take into consideration the financial circumstances and the continuing expenditure which may be required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A number of honourable senators expressed an interest in children with coeliac disease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that this is of considerable benefit to parents who have this continuing expenditure because their children have special dietary requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw attention again to the widening of guidelines for the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance, compared with those which originally applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Minister is aware, this year we are celebrating the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> is a year that is designated by the United Nations for celebration with regard to our responsibilities to our children and their rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as the making of arrangements is concerned, the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> is one to which we are committed through our membership of the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did a committee from the Housing Commission of New South Wales, the Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care, the Kindergarten Union and the New South Wales Department of Youth and Community Services report to the Minister in December 1977 that there was no significant unmet need for long day care in the New South Wales suburbs and areas of Glebe, Airds, Macquarie Fields, Lethbridge Park, Hebersham, Shalvey or Windale? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are concerned that the children’s services program should, as far as possible, be directing attention to the range of services which are required in addition to the assistance which we give to State governments for pre-school education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Attorney-General seen the speech of his colleague,  Mr Ellicott,  to the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Conference in Canberra on 17 March in which  Mr Ellicott  drew attention to the desirable protections to the legal rights of children which would be accomplished if the Criminal Investigation Bill were to be enacted? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the human context infant milk preparations also may constitute the sole food intake of the <span class="highlight">child</span> and consequently the requirements for the labelling indicating the nutrient content of these products are stringent and indeed much more stringent than those applied to preparations for dogs.I understand that, generally, it is required that all prepared packaged food for animal consumption shall be labelled with:- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I bring to the attention of the Senate a document entitled ‘A Report on Health Conditions of Aboriginal Children in Western Australia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was prepared for the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom as part of its contribution towards the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It contains very important statistics of which I think the Senate should take a great deal of notice in this International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A Swedish pamphlet on the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> says that ‘today there are approximately 200 million children who never get a chance to learn reading, writing or counting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply make the point that to my mind this is a very important report because this happens to be the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> and the Aboriginal children in Australia are the most hard done by children in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A middle-aged woman who lives in a camp near Perth is one whose camp life goes back for decades: ‘I was taken to New Norcia (mission) when a <span class="highlight">child</span>,’ she told us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The children used to suffer from scabies, living under such conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many’s the time we had to wrap a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a blanket and take it to the hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are aware that this is the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I said at the outset, this is the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those children still need help- most of all the Aboriginal children and particularly those who reside in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is about time, in May of 1979, the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>, that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Senator Chaney)  gave information to the Senate about special projects being put forward to further the cause of Aboriginal children in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already apologised to the honourable senator for not being here to hear her comments about the problems relating to Aboriginal <span class="highlight">child</span> health in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to say, without wishing to diminish any concern that she may have raised about the health of Aboriginal children, that the Senate should know that substantial funds are put into Aboriginal health in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are all now obtaining a growing realisation of the wide range of children with specific learning difficulties- not only dyslexia, aphasia and autism but also the less obvious difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s attitude, in the first place, is to get the earliest identification possible of any such difficulties in the young <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was a very active member- in fact a much more active member than I- in the church in which I was raised as a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, since they have been out in the open as a positive supplementary payment to wage and salary earners, pensioners and social security recipients with children- a move which this side of the House supported- many Government back benchers, particularly people such as the honourable member for Moore  (Mr Hyde)  have been advocating cuts in these payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Family allowances are a recognition that it costs money to raise children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, allowances for the children of pensioners and other beneficiaries have not been raised by this Government since it took office in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have remained at $7.50 per week per <span class="highlight">child</span> for the last four years in spite of the increases in the cost of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was said by the ALP and others that the community would be better off under the Hayden endowment-rebate <span class="highlight">child</span> scheme of 1 975-76. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People have forgotten that that scheme embodied an income test of roughly $4 a week for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> and $3 per week for successive children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time as looking at welfare expenditure I think we need to look at those other programs of government and talk of what has been able to be done in the matter of <span class="highlight">child</span> care and children’s services, services for handicapped people where the three-year program has given a much wider spread and improved service in our rehabilitation services, and in the very many excellent services which are conducted by the community groups, in some cases where we with State governments are jointly sharing projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly there have been cuts in public expenditure- time will not permit me to enumerate them in detail- in areas such as pensions, <span class="highlight">child</span> care, legal aid, Aboriginal health programs and community health programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Working Womens Centre in Newcastle runs a range of services such as a <span class="highlight">child</span> care program for working women in the area, including migrant women and aged women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Is the Minister for Social Security aware of criticism by the  President  of the Australian College of Paediatrics that the Government’s disbanding of the Children’s Commission has resulted in a breakdown of communication between professional workers in the field of early childhood services and the Federal Department of Social Security’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister refute the allegations that valuable information identifying warning signs of possible <span class="highlight">child</span> abuse has failed to reach the welfare agencies because the co-ordination which used to operate through the Children’s Commission is no longer in existence? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware of the criticism by the  President  of the Australian College of Paediatrics of the Government’s disabanding of the Children’s Commission, lt was an interim Children’s Commission not one that had been proclaimed as a commission by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Government does not see the co-ordination of State government activities as a prime function of the Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care of my Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The consultative committees to the interim committee of the Children’s Commission varied from State to State but they were essentially concerned with making recommendations on the allocation of Commonwealth funds in the <span class="highlight">child</span> care and preschool areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, their main function was never to facilitate the exchange of information between persons involved in the early childhood field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Commonwealth, through the children’s services program in the Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care and acting on advice from committees and community groups, gives grants to facilitate the sharing of information through, for example, the funding of conferences and in other ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the children’s services program is now funding a number of projects concerned with <span class="highlight">child</span> abuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Projects funded in this way include telephone and personal counselling services, programs for mothers and children at risk and a number of neighbourhood centres which provide facilities for crisis relief for parents under stress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Funds also have been provided to the States for the expansion of services to children whose mothers are temporarily accommodated in women’s refuges, frequently because of domestic violence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many ways in which the Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care and professional groups are able to share information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be concerned if any professional group felt that it did not have access to the Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care or that the Office would not communicate usefully with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I state in respect of the comment of the  President  of the Australian College of Paediatrics that I hope his organisation, State governments and the Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care together will be able to do a great deal to assist children in the ways the College may think important and in the ways which fit in with the Government’s program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the National Therapeutic Goods Committee recommend in November 1976 that the Government take immediate steps to ensure that drugs which have commonly proved dangerous to children be packaged in childresistant containers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the present mothers or guardians allowance for age, invalid and widow pensioners and for supporting parents beneficiaries currently stand at $4 a week, or $6 a week if a <span class="highlight">child</span> is under six years of age or is an invalid <span class="highlight">child</span> requiring full time care? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would it not be reasonable to expect that as a <span class="highlight">child</span> becomes older greater expense is incurred by the guardian? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If this assumption is reasonable, what is the reason for a $2-a-week reduction in the guardians allowance when a <span class="highlight">child</span> reaches the age of six years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I gave it to my youngest <span class="highlight">child</span> to play and he reported to me that it was totally incomprehensible in terms of quality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Department ofSocial Security made any projections on the future use and availability of <span class="highlight">child</span> care services in Australia: if so, what are those projections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-9">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ) The Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care within my Department is currently preparing a booklet which will be distributed to all Honourable Members and Senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The booklet will list all projects currently funded under the Children’s Services Program, excluding vacation care and pre-school services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also anticipated that a supplementary booklet will be prepared following analysis of a census currently being conducted on the Children ‘s Services Program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This supplementary booklet will contain additional information including whether the project is funded under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act and more detailed analysis on service provision and usage by groups considered by the Commonwealth to be in priority need of <span class="highlight">child</span> care services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well as the census already mentioned, the Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care is holding discussions with the Australian Bureau of Statistics and State/Territory Governments regarding various collections which will assist in the planning of <span class="highlight">child</span> care services and in the prediction of future <span class="highlight">child</span> care demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and ( 5 ) Courses in <span class="highlight">child</span> care are offered at educational institutions which are the responsibility of State Governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the wide range of prospective employing organisations (not necessarily confined to <span class="highlight">child</span> care services funded under the Children’s Services Program) the Department of Social Security is not in a position to make such projections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of the people who came to speak to us, we found that educationalists and parents were concerned that television was also adversely affecting the learning behaviour of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, some of them claimed that escapist material, watched mainly by children, was stifling the development of children’s creative instinct and imagination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other people who appeared before the Committee in the course of its inquiry argued that because television had the ability to monopolise so much of the average <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s time we, the Australian community, should capitalise on that situation by offering and presenting programs which were informative and imaginative and in which a <span class="highlight">child</span> might very well have some intellectual involvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I would ask whether the 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. time slot is the best for the screening of these children’s programs and whether it maximises the <span class="highlight">child</span> viewing audience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the material submitted to the Tribunal by the Children’s Program Committee this was stressed as the best period, but  Mr Morgan,  speaking on behalf of the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations, did not agree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have stated that we see our task as offering constructive assistance to stations and producers to enable them to work together to achieve entertaining children’s programs of excellent quality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore there is a call today for the public generally to require and to demand better standards in television programming and better quality in children’s television programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Programs which are wholly didactic in content and approach tend to be avoided by the average <span class="highlight">child</span>, who may well have spent most of the day in a classroom environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I am sure that there is a strong case to be made against the abandonment of the Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> in relation to what he or she has been required to tune into in recent times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well, I had experience in the early 1970s of trying to live on $19 a week unemployment benefit while supporting a wife and <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore ask: Has the United States Public Health Service Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices recommended the use of measles vaccine in children exposed to natural infection up to 72 hours previously? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, is it opportune for all doctors concerned with <span class="highlight">child</span> health to encourage the use of proven safe immunisation practices, and should Australia be pursuing vigorously vaccination against, and elimination of, measles? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also considered opportune for all doctors concerned with <span class="highlight">child</span> health to encourage the use of proven safe immunisation practices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many employers or employer groups have been approached by the Minister’s Department with a view to setting up work-related <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres for ethnic communities- as recommended by the Galbally Report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The current <span class="highlight">child</span>-care policy should be reviewed and the Government should give priority to funding <span class="highlight">child</span>-care facilities at places of work, jointly managed by the employers and employees or unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed that letters be sent to a number of major employers to inform them of the availability of assistance from the Children’s Services Program with establishing workbased and work-related <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities and of the general conditions of eligibility and to invite responses from them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Community nurses have reported to Opposition senators that when a medical complaint for a school <span class="highlight">child</span> is diagnosed the parents are notified so that the first stage of primary care can be entered into. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>water, food or from lead in paints used on buildings or on toys is needed to protect the population as a whole and particularly the developing <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, how many individual children are catered for at the Australian National University staff <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not able to give all the detail required by  Senator Walters,  but I am able to say that in the present quarter the average daily number of children at the ANU preschool and <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre is equivalent to 90 full time children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the licence is to cater for 80 children, but the number of children at the centre on any given day exceeds that number because of part time attendance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act my Department subsidises some qualified staff to the extent of $58,000, and the total running costs of the centre for the calendar year 1 977 totalled $207,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply draw the attention of the Senate again to figures which show that as at the end of the last financial year the following losses have been incurred by families as a result of the failure of the Government to index or increase the family allowance payment: For a family with one <span class="highlight">child</span> the loss has been $3.50 a week, for a family with two children, $8.50 a week; for a family with three children, $ 14.50; for a family with three children with one student <span class="highlight">child</span>, $14.50; and for a family with three children with two student children, $ 14.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I acknowledge that there has been no increase in the rates that have been given to family allowance payments, but $ 1,000m is spent on family allowances in this country and a factor that is not recognised is that in the 1976 Budget this Government replaced the Hayden tax rebates for children and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment with family allowances, and this initiative brought greatly increased assistance to some 300,000 families with 800,000 children who did not benefit from the Hayden scheme of tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That additional number of the lowest income people who were not able to have the advantage of tax rebates-300,000 families and 800,000 children- are now receiving substantial family allowances, whereas they were unable to take advantage of the tax rebates because of the level of their income in previous years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not necessarily a good thing for a community to regard the Aboriginal people as something separate, something different, something like a <span class="highlight">child</span> to whom people have to look down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be regarded as informed speculation, on the basis of the very estimates which have been submitted to this chamber For its consideration at this moment, unless of course as a result of public opinion Princess Anne does what many consider to be the right thing and uses her own wealth and pays for her own visit here as World  President  of the Save the Children Fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggested early in May that some such course could be graciously and honourably taken by Princess Anne, thus freeing the $25,000 and enabling the Australian Government to make a direct gift to the Save the Children Fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would immediately relieve the plight and suffering of wretched children in this International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>, a suggestion which I notice was repeated by Gerald Reece in the  Sun  of 8 May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable senators that 1979 is the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> and that children are requiring the use of those refuges as much as women are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many more children than women are in need of the services of the refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At one stage in Nardine the ratio of children to women has 4.1:1, which I think is quite horrific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The needs of children in our refuge are not catered for as wc have no member of staff involved in helping these children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> we hope the needs of the children in our refuge can be met in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to <span class="highlight">child</span> care, I agree that many of the children who pass through these refuges, or are in contact with them, do need special assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been able to make arrangements to improve the standard of <span class="highlight">child</span> care that can be given in refuges and assistance in that way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The arrangements that have been made by the Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care, in regard to <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities, resources and programs for the assistance of refuges that are funded under the Community Health Program, will be of great benefit to children who need to take refuge in the way that we have all described. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am hopeful that it will lead to improved care of children and greater relief for mothers and the staff of the women’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Senator Coleman  is very concerned for the children in these situations, I think she needs to know what went on at the Hobart refuge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After various investigations were conducted into the Hobart shelter, the State Minister eventually ordered that <span class="highlight">child</span> social welfare workers should from time to time enter that shelter and keep an eye on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was entirely in response to his concern for the children in that shelter that the State Minister for Health made this order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct to the Minister for Social Security a question which relates to her responsibility in her capacity as Minister in charge of the Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister say whether it is a fact that Australia does not keep statistics on <span class="highlight">child</span> abuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is a fact, can the Minister say what basis is used for conducting existing programs for children at risk in that area? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present no statistics with regard to <span class="highlight">child</span> abuse are collected at a Commonwealth level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of projects within the Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care are designed to prevent <span class="highlight">child</span> abuse and many of them come under the family services support programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the recent annual meeting of the Council of Social Welfare Ministers of Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea, the Ministers and I agreed to move towards a common definition of <span class="highlight">child</span> abuse to enable a national assessment of the serious problem to be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be of interest to honourable senators that a national conference has been planned to be held in Queensland early in 198.1 to discuss the problems of <span class="highlight">child</span> abuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as far as the general question is concerned, at present no statistics on <span class="highlight">child</span> abuse are collected at the Commonwealth level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government noted a report in last Monday’s Melbourne  Age  of what is said to be definitive research of the Harvard University research team covering more than 2,000 children over three years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This report says that lead in the body, even in relatively low amounts, causes ‘mental deficits’ in young children- specifically, lower IQs and more classroom behaviour problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government make its own investigation of this important research study, especially its reported assertions that lead in the body ranks after only nutritional problems and accidents as a <span class="highlight">child</span> health hazard? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report suggested that lead in the body comes behind only nutritional problems and accidents as a <span class="highlight">child</span> health hazard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We would be a poor, weak people, would we not, if we could not do that with our natural advantages, if we were to say to ourselves that we have no alternative but to rip out what future generations may need, that we will not even try to do without this oil, that we are prepared to devastate natural resources just because we want it now, like a <span class="highlight">child</span> wanting a toy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am referring to people who have come to this country, overstayed their visas, come to certain domestic arrangements within Australia, such as having children here, and then suddenly have been deported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The country stores in many areas made a rake-off out of this very small amount of wages because, even in those rare instances when an Aboriginal mother received <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, she would have to get the local policeman to collect her cheque and then perhaps he would give her a chit so that she could go to the store and buy food for her <span class="highlight">child</span> or children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By all accounts the Chief Justice not only was associated initially with the selection of the building design but also, ever since its construction began, has been playing about with it rather like an eight year old <span class="highlight">child</span> with a mechano set, taking a bit off here, putting a bit back there, redesigning this, fiddling with that- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went on to indicate the complete lack of awareness within the Australian school system of the problems faced by the immigrant <span class="highlight">child</span> and in one particular passage drew attention to the fact that children in schools were being forcibly, one might say, educated in the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, a paper tabled today- that is, the paper entitled ‘Provision for <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education ‘-draws attention to the recommendations made in the Galbally report involving the teaching of English as a second language requiring the provision of an extra $ 10m for funding and the allocation of $5m over the course of three years for multicultural education in schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By this time other people outside the Mental Health Authority and outside this establishment had become interested in these children and were impressed by them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The special education centre at Burwood State College had watched the children work and had watched this particular <span class="highlight">child</span> work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The State College of Melbourne had watched the children communicate and had communicated with them and it agreed that there was intelligence there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therapists and other people in the community also had watched and listened to the children and had agreed that there was intelligence there and that something should be done about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People who were concerned and who worked with them asked the State department for funds in order to give these children proper education and a proper place to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Schools Commission was asked for funds from the innovations program to give these children the education and the environment they needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For years the parents of these children were not brought into any programs because there were no programs to bring them into. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the last few years, as it has been proved little by little that the children are able to be educated, the parents have been kept in the dark. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What would most parents do if they had a small baby or small <span class="highlight">child</span> whom the authorities said was severely retarded and had advised them to put away? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that, with a lot of heartache, they will take the advice of the experts and put the <span class="highlight">child</span> away and then try to forget that they produced that <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be hard for them not to believe that there was something wrong with them for producing that <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are now threatened by people who come along and say that because they care more, because they have taken more time, because they have used more tests, the <span class="highlight">child</span> is not hopelessly retarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It may be physically retarded, but mentally it is a very clever <span class="highlight">child</span>, it has got a very high 1Q. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Children who have kept their sanity and their curiosity in that sort of sterile atmosphere for all that time would have to be very intelligent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So now we have parents who have to face up to the fact that over those years they have in a sense abandoned a <span class="highlight">child</span>, left it a prisoner inside a body that would not work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of the authorities reacting with care, love, concern and some sense of excitement because these children are not lost, there is a great future in front of them, and instead of the authorities supporting these parents by bringing them into the programs so that everyone can go on together, they are reacting in a most violent fashion as though they were keeping them prisoners, as though they were gaolers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me that it is vital to foster the use of a library in secondary schools because so much depends upon a <span class="highlight">child</span> being able to use a library and developing a love of books. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The alterations proposed to make the property suitable for a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre basically comprise internal partitioning and removal of walls, the closing in of a verandah, upgrading of the buildings at the back of the property, and general renovation and improvement of facilities to enable the property to meet State licensing requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-64-5">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Australian Government has recognised the importance of this project by providing, I understand, $64m towards its success, and in view of the success of the scheme in drawing attention to the needs of children in our modern society, will the Minister give favourable consideration to conducting a year of the Australian pioneer with the object of encouraging special projects for the aged in our community, a sector which is growing in number and creating great strain on organisations dedicated to providing facilities for these citizens who have done so much for the country during their lives? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The decision to have an International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> was taken at the Thirty-first Session of the United Nations General Assembly on 2 1 December 1976 and the year 1979 was chosen as it is the 20th anniversary of the Declaration of Rights of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we look at the 1975-76 Budget Speech of  Mr Hayden  we find under the heading of education and the sub-heading of pre-schools and <span class="highlight">child</span> care in the States that in 1973-74 the actual expenditure on pre-schools and <span class="highlight">child</span> care in the States was $6.8m, that in the next year the actual expenditure was $45. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, refers to a ruling which we have been told comes from Canberra and affects the payment of family allowances to parents of handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In one case a parent who had put a <span class="highlight">child</span> into an approved home for a holiday rest for 1 S days was told finally that she had lost both payments for the whole month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the children are in homes on the fourteenth or fifteenth of a month the parent loses both payments for the full month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Family allowances have not been increased since 1976, when they were introduced to replace <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, which had remained unchanged for many years and had become fairly meaningless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-84-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They also replaced the tax rebate for children, which in any reasonable system of tax indexation would have been indexed since 1976 and certainly would have been increased since 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-84-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allowances are extremely important to that group in the community who are not touched by our social security system- the working poor, the people on low incomes with a number of dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-84-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one adds to that group the pensioners with children whose dependants’ allowances also have not been increased since 1975 one finds that those people in the community are being affected severely by inflation and by the failure of the Government to recognise that and to compensate them for the inflationary forces in our economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-84-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The proposal put forward by the sponsor, was, firstly, that the family should come to Australia to be accommodated by the daughter in her own home; secondly, that the mother and the elder <span class="highlight">child</span> could give assistance in the home and perhaps in the business; thirdly, that the father could make whatever contribution was appropriate for his age; and, fourthly, that the younger children should attend school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact,  Senator Grimes  is on record as saying that the high cost of increasing payments to the 4.3 million children who are the subject of family allowances represents an inhibiting effect on any desire by the present Federal Government to increase them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The family allowance scheme provides for the payment of a universal family allowance to every <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, every <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia receives the same benefit regardless of his family circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Family Allowances, which replaced the old system of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and taxation rebates for children, present a means whereby a start can be made to give a more equitable distribution of public monies to benefit those in need, while more basic changes in other areas are sorted out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it was considered desirable not to add to government spending, a reduction in the Family Allowance could pay for the increased supplement paid to lower income groups, e.g a reduction of $4 per month per <span class="highlight">child</span> would have resulted in approximately $200,000,000 in 1 978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind him that guardians’ allowances, supplementary assistance and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment all lost value under the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All he says is that he will come up with the response to the unremitting neglect of pensioners’ dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If his response is to abandon the universal family allowance scheme, let us hear that from him so that the people can judge which payment they prefer to receive on behalf of the children of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government took away <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and cut out tax rebates for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> this Government has not seen fit to increase the $10 allowance paid to parents of handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has not seen fit to raise the isolated children’s allowance to anything like a realistic amount of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> the children’s allowance paid to pensioners has not been increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>5m for <span class="highlight">child</span> care services and pre-schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in real terms we see a reductionSenator Messner talked about this- of about 3 per cent of the allocation to the people who want to maintain their <span class="highlight">child</span> care services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It spent the money on giving a better living standard to people who needed it, in the way of increased pensions, more money for <span class="highlight">child</span> care services, more money for hospitals, more money for land commissions and that type of thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a scholar and dependent spouse the figure would be 45 per cent, compared with the CPI figure of 33 per cent and for a scholar, dependent spouse and one dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> 42 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a scholar, dependent spouse and one <span class="highlight">child</span> the figures would be 42 per cent as compared with 43 per cent for the CPI. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A mother may go along with a couple of prescriptions because she has a <span class="highlight">child</span> with a chest complaint or a <span class="highlight">child</span> with tonsilitis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> died on her way to hospitalnot to Maroondah Hospital, which is only three miles away, but to Box Hill Hospital, 12 miles away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard, children have become unimportant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We deceive ourselves that we cannot afford to enjoy the pleasures of children if we wish to maintain a high standard of living and achieve an even higher level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it is well for us to remember this in the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be in it’, ‘Have A Go’, Project Australia or the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> campaigns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With respect to the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>, advertisers prompted people to visualise children as special people, with their own unique problems, needing to be treated in a specific manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It changed the whole structure of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and introduced a family allowance concept that brought about the greatest transfer of real wealth from the affluent to the poor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The profits of companies are distributed to millions of Australians, firstly in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, pensions and education services and, secondly, in superannuation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we will take more and will translate the efforts and energies of that doctor, and even of lawyers like  Senator Button,  into <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, pensions and those kinds of things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To bring it down to a per capita basis, $390 for every many, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia is the extent to which this Government has borrowed over the last four years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pre-School and <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care- Down 26.5 percent <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The payments for senior citizens centres and pre-schools and <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres are all reduced according to those figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is simple; any <span class="highlight">child</span> could work that out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everybody knows- it would be clear to any <span class="highlight">child</span>- that the Australian Government sets the economic climate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">child</span> knows it and everybody in this place knows it, yet honourable senators opposite who understand that still come out with the same old guff and get the headlines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate, noting that the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> should be marked by programs of lasting benefit- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we took the total population of Australia and somehow reduced the persons concerned to the age and status of those under 12 years, we would still have less than one per cent of the <span class="highlight">child</span> population of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are one billion five hundred million children under 12 years of age round the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the scope of the challenge with which we are confronted by the United Nations in this International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its Declaration of the Rights of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>, which I will seek shortly to incorporate in  Hansard,  the United Nations challenges us to improve the lot of children wherever they may be, without regard to geographical or social barriers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the last part of the preamble states, mankind owes to the <span class="highlight">child</span> the best it has to give. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will touch on the appropriate response to the international situation of children towards the end of my remarks, but I wish first of all and largely to concentrate on some aspects of the Australian situation- the <span class="highlight">child</span> in our own backyardbecause here I believe there is no cause for apathy or complacency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was stung into putting this matter on the Notice Paper by my constant attendance- I am sure other honourable senators have shared this experience during the year- at various celebrations, competitions and events to mark the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>- all very happy, all very superficial, and perhaps helping to foster a general apathy or complacency in the community about the state of our children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I want to demonstrate, the rights of our children in various ways are by no means guaranteed by the sort of society we have operating in Australia at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are three million children under 12 years of age in Australia, and it is concerning their rights that I wish to speak tonight, at least in part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I seek leave to incorporate in  Hansard  the Declaration of the Rights of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> as promulgated by the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whereas the <span class="highlight">child</span>, by reason of his physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas the need for such special safeguards has been stated in the Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> of 1924 and recognised in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the statutes of specialised agencies and international organisations concerned with the welfare of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope to take some areas from that Declaration of the Rights of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> and describe practical concrete constructive steps which ought to be taken in order to secure some of those rights on behalf of these children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to secure their rights; they are inherent in them of course, but the most obvious fact about children is their dependence on us as adults to create the sort of society in which they can grow to maturity as loving and mature human beings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am afraid that unless politicians and governments take some steps to leave a mark by way of concrete practical proposals on the statute book and administrative action, the whole year will evaporate in a series of sentimental happenings which leave no permanent imprint for the betterment of our children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I intend to take this United Nations Declaration of the Rights of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>, which was adopted by the United Nations on 20 November 1959, and, looking at some of the 10 principles there outlined, reflect on the situation in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> shall be protected against all forms of neglect, cruelty and exploitation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The major theme of 1979 must be to secure the <span class="highlight">child</span> against gross maltreatment within the home, the very area in which a <span class="highlight">child</span> should expect security and affectionate nurture and protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are powerless, voiceless children in our society who have been battered and sexually molested, and the community needs to bring this to its consciousness so that programs may be devised to deal with this tragic situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Hobart paediatrician claimed yesterday that there was an epidemic of <span class="highlight">child</span> abuse in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well known from his contributions in this Senate that he has been most concerned about the physical disciplining of children within our educational system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that that is only one instance of a general phenomenon in our society where violence is used against those who are the most defenceless and the most vulnerable- our children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even in the resplendent isle of Tasmania about 100 such cases occur every year and are reported to the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Protection Assessment Board, and even that number may be only the tip of the iceberg. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps in Tasmania, with our smaller community, there may be fewer instances of battering of children than occur in the large anonymous cities of the mainland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One should pay a compliment to the innovative and largely successful work of those agencies in the various States which have grown up to deal with cases of <span class="highlight">child</span> abuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that all honourable senators will be as grieved as I am to know that any Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> is subject to such battery, such physical abuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to devise caring mechanisms which can alert us to situations where a <span class="highlight">child</span> is really at risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Luckily, medical research has indicated to us various criteria, which I will not detail but which can indicate to the family doctor, to a social worker or perhaps to the principal of a school that a <span class="highlight">child</span> is at risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are indications in the mother-<span class="highlight">child</span> bonding at birth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has emerged as perhaps the most significant event in determining whether a <span class="highlight">child</span> will be subject to physical abuse by the mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am told by medical practitioners that breast feeding is also reemerging as a most significant factor in establishing the psychological and nutritional well-being of the <span class="highlight">child</span> in its relationship with its mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let us assume that a <span class="highlight">child</span> really is at risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This may require removing the <span class="highlight">child</span> from the family for a time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Case loads are so extensive that social workers have not got the time which is emerging as the essence of the healing process in those families which are fractured and where the <span class="highlight">child</span> is at risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has emerged that in cases where a <span class="highlight">child</span> is at risk of battery by the mother in particular all that is needed is a woman who herself bears some of the battle scars of bringing up a family- perhaps her children have now grown up- and who has the time for the endless cups of tea needed to help the mother come to an understanding and to experience, perhaps, the love and affection from that older woman who bears the battle scars, so that the mother in turn can show some affection and love towards the <span class="highlight">child</span> at risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also needed is the free installation of a telephone in those homes where a <span class="highlight">child</span> has been battered or where the risk of battery is apparent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost of installing such a telephone would be infinitesimal compared with the social cost endured and borne by society eventually when a battery occurs and where medical and social treatment is required for the <span class="highlight">child</span> and the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the second type of <span class="highlight">child</span> abuse- the sexual- I intend to say a few words about incest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that incest is the most prevalent form of <span class="highlight">child</span> abuse in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise this aspect only because I find that people will not admit that sexual abuse is the last frontier of <span class="highlight">child</span> abuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Ray  Willich, who is the Superintendent of Allambie, a Victorian Government receiving centre for wards of state, has published a notable book called  The Troubled Ones  about emotionally and physically battered children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Based on his own experience and on projections of United States figures, he believes that probably 20,000 Australian children are abused sexually each year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the last frontier of <span class="highlight">child</span> abuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the need to activate that collective consciousness that impels me to make mention of that particular abuse of children tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United Nations Declaration of the Rights of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> states that a <span class="highlight">child</span> is entitled as of right to a situation of moral and emotional security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The declaration states that the <span class="highlight">child</span> is entitled to be protected from cruelty and exploitation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can think- perhaps we have been blessed in our families- that this is not applicable to an affluent and easy going society like Australia and that those rights do not need to be fought for and secured on behalf of our children; but, in fact, they do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As unemployment grows and as more male breadwinners find themselves trapped, as it were, back at home in a situation to which they are unaccustomed with small children under their feet hour after hour- these people are low in self-esteem because of lack of employment and are frustrated- they will take out their frustrations on the small children who are under their feet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The right to education, therefore, certainly cannot be guaranteed to a <span class="highlight">child</span> simply by ensuring that it has a certain number of hours of schooling of a certain quality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Education is much wider than schooling, as we all know, and as I say the major formation of our children is taking place perhaps in television studios, out of the control of school, parents, and other social influences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The preamble to this Declaration of the Rights of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> says, amongst other things:   . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the <span class="highlight">child</span>, by reason  or  his physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that many police regulations and arrangements do encourage or seemingly require the police to notify parents or adult friends when a <span class="highlight">child</span> is taken in for questioning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But those regulations are not always honoured, and therefore I think it is incumbent upon Parliaments, by enactment, to ensure that children are not questioned in circumstances such as I have outlined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Tasmanian Parliament expects shortly to have introduced a Bill on criminal investigation which, amongst other things- and this emerged from a committee of which I had the privilege to be  Chairman-  will stipulate that when a <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 is under police restraint, his parent or guardian should be immediately notified, and that no questioning of a <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 should take place except in the presence of a parent, relative, adult friend, lawyer, welfare officer or teacher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These seem to me to be minimum requirements in order to secure the <span class="highlight">child</span>, as the Declaration says, against situations where he is unable to contend for himself because of his physical and emotional immaturity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I could speak now of the requirement in the preamble that special legal protection be given to the <span class="highlight">child</span> before birth, here I simply want to consider a surprising gap which was revealed in our common law system by the thalidomide incident. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall the incident some years ago when children were born with multiple and gross deformities as a result of the mother taking a sedative, 1 think it was, which had been insufficiently tested by the major drug company which distributed it for sale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, despite all the bluff and the various actions in the English High Court, there was no legal process by which the parents could take that company to court to get monetary compensation for the sheer financial loss they may have suffered in meeting the medical and other expenses in dealing with the <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s deformity, and of course no compensation or damages were available for the emotional shock and the continuing emotional situation which that family might face. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that it would be an elementary but significant step forward if the parliaments of Australia passed laws which would allow damages to be recoverable for injuries inflicted on a <span class="highlight">child</span> while it was within the womb, that is, injuries which led to its disabling, which was evident upon birth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as I say, there is no legal right inherent in the family concerned to recover damages for injuries suffered by the <span class="highlight">child</span> while in the womb, which injuries become manifest upon the live birth of that <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the simple straightforward case, of course, of the negligent driver who injures a <span class="highlight">child</span> while it is within the womb of the mother, in other words, a pregnant woman who is herself involved in a car accident due to the negligence of another person, and the <span class="highlight">child</span> is born suffering manifest injuries caused by that accident. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are harder cases where perhaps the mother herself has been negligent in exposing the <span class="highlight">child</span> to the possibility of injury by continuing with some drug which has a deleterious effect on the <span class="highlight">child</span>, whether it be a hard drug or aspirin or alcohol, all of which, as we all know, do have a deleterious effect on the foetus and can result in the <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s being born with some illness or propensity for weakness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not speaking of the unfortunate, sad incidents when that happens quite accidentally; I am saying that perhaps the law should look at the situation of a mother continuing to expose herself to a situation which will result in an injury to the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet one knows that that has an adverse effect on a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, if it is proved that the taking of marihuana by a pregnant mother has a harmful effect on another, namely, the <span class="highlight">child</span> in the womb, I would only be consistent- there is no question of my being inconsistent- in saying that my principle would apply, that perhaps we should be thinking of introducing legislation which makes it clear that the mother has a duty of care, which the community will enforce towards the <span class="highlight">child</span> within the womb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have been encouraged to continue, I refer honourable senators to Principle 3 of the Declaration of the Rights of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>, which states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> shall be entitled from his birth to a name and a nationality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> shall in all circumstances be among the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another good point is the fact that regrettably, as the International Labour Organisation has pointed out time and time again, but more recently in this Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>, <span class="highlight">child</span> labour is still a very widespread practice in many countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It took a Dickens to alert the Englishspeaking world to the plight of children in sweat shops, which he had had to endure while his father was in the debtors’ prison. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It took his pen, dipped in memories of his own experience, and his compassionate writings to alert the Englishspeaking world to the plight of those children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we need is another Dickens to arise and expose, as  Senator Puplick  has pointed out, the plight of those children who are still in a situation of slavery in other cultures of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I was saying, my remarks perhaps have concentrated on the <span class="highlight">child</span> in our own backyard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps that is not a bad thing really because who are we to preach to those other countries if we have not remedied situations in which children effectively are deprived of their rights within Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not wish unduly to dwell on the more vulnerable and depressing aspects of being a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thank God, that is not the total story and perhaps it is not the  story  at all in the case of many, if not most, of our Australian children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need to leave a mark on our statute books, in our laws, in our administrative arrangements, in our very practicable, constructive, concrete encouragement of voluntary organisations, whereby the rights of children as outlined in the United Nations Declaration are indeed secured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Tate in his remarks outlined for us in a very helpful way something of what flows from the ill treatment of, lack of consideration for, lack of love, care and affection for the world ‘s children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He pinned his argument to the details of the United Nations Declaration of the rights of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been some emphasis on a particular kind of <span class="highlight">child</span> who is suffering from a range of disadvantages, but there are all kinds of children in all parts of the world living in all classes of society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He would not be surprised if all Australian governments- and maybe our own Government in particular- listed the kind of things that they were doing for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather he draws attention to the needs of the <span class="highlight">child</span>, here and everywhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The needs of the <span class="highlight">child</span>, of course, are manifold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The needs are social, medical and educational and they range over the whole area of looking after, caring for, being concerned about and being concerned for a <span class="highlight">child</span> who has no one to have any concern for him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Believe it or not, the majority of my exercises as  Chairman  of that Senate Committee have dealt with the needs of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have dealt with the needs of isolated children and with the needs of children as far as television is concerned, and we are about to start on the needs of the <span class="highlight">child</span> with regard to aspects of literacy and numeracy in his vocation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because one has engaged in those particular exercises, it would be an impertinence on my part to suggest that they have applied themselves to the needs of a <span class="highlight">child</span> and thereby have made a contribution to the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather I suggest that in these particular exercises we have engaged in inquiries which have revealed to us some of the needs of the <span class="highlight">child</span>, some of the things that need to be done and some of the things that have been done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All along the line we have called for a responsibility on the part of the Australian community and, through the Australian community, on the part of the world community to exercise degrees of responsibility in relation to the needs, desires, hopes, aspirations and opportunities of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of us, whether we have children or whether we do not have children, have a responsibility to see that the next generation of our citizens have opportunities, the freedom to express themselves, the capacity to develop their talents and the opportunity to move into places which the preceding generation leaves so that all that is good in society may be carried on and expanded and all that is undesirable in society may be corrected and, if possible, eliminated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I refer very briefly to my first exercise, television in the life of the Australian <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of us know that the process by which a <span class="highlight">child</span> fits into society covers many areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we look at the children in our midst we know that by learning, whether it be in verbal or non-verbal languages, they will be able to develop their personalities and thereby make their later contributions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know also that as children stand in our midst they are impressed and influenced by attitudes, values, opinions, skills and knowledge, but there is also the area that the <span class="highlight">child</span> acquires from outside that circle- the agencies, the schools, the peer groups and the churches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of those things enable a <span class="highlight">child</span> to develop as a functional member of society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only natural that a <span class="highlight">child</span> will be influenced by television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Tate  has said, today’s statistics show that a <span class="highlight">child</span> watches television for something like three hours a day or 20 hours a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the hearings which we conducted it was reported to us that there were more than isolated cases of a <span class="highlight">child</span> watching television for anything up to 80 hours a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To repeat what the honourable senator has said, a <span class="highlight">child</span> spends more time watching television than he does in any of his other occupations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every one of us here is concerned at the influence that television has on a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Submissions came to us from parents, from educationists, from sociologists and from community leaders, all of whom were extremely concerned at the influence of television on a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think of the situation of a <span class="highlight">child</span> whose family does not have a television set in the home and who at school the next morning is entirely out of touch with the peer group and with what is going on because he has not seen the programs of the night before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think of the story told to us by one witnessthis may have been repeated in the Senate before- of the <span class="highlight">child</span> who would not believe there were such people as women doctors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mother took the <span class="highlight">child</span> to a woman doctor and still the <span class="highlight">child</span> was not convinced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mother gave the <span class="highlight">child</span> a book to read about a woman doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Still the <span class="highlight">child</span> was not convinced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> saw a program on television in which a woman doctor was featured, turned to her mother and said: You are right, there are such people as women doctors’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think of the <span class="highlight">child</span> looking through the window at a garden scene, turning to the television set and seeing a garden scene on the television screen, turning again to the window to see the garden scene and then endeavouring to turn off the window. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole style of life of a <span class="highlight">child</span> is influenced by the television set. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would not surprise honourable senators to know that a great amount of material was presented to us which drew attention to the effects of violence in television programs upon a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is not surprising sometimes that our children are attracted to and transfixed by a violent program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, we know from statistics that violence has a very heavy influence on children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All this is a reflection of what is happening in our world, but there is no need whatsoever to put violence before children at an age when we are endeavouring to encourage the development of their intellect, skill and appreciation, their sense of understanding, tolerance and forgiveness, and their companionship with other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be it judgment upon us that we are allowing to be portrayed violent programs which, in this International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>, represent an offence against the needs of a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate Committee presented its report in relation to this and a whole range of other things concerning children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We spoke of the reduction in the level of violence in programs and of the influence of television on the learning behaviour of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We referred to advertising and its unfair and undue influence on the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the kinds of things to which, in the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>, society should be giving some attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn briefly to the next area in which I have been involved, as  Chairman  of the Senate Committee, as far as children are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the needs of the isolated children of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Doubtless most of us think of an isolated <span class="highlight">child</span> as someone who lives beyond the furthest fences in the great outback, in the great lonely distances of this country, but isolated children are to be found in other circumstances also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are educationally isolated children who live within an hour’s drive of this building. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are in all parts of this country children who are isolated from one reason or another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was another exercise in which we took on board the needs of children who did not have the access to educational, cultural and medical facilities of those who live in our urban areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our report has engendered a great deal of interest and concern by a very large section of the Australian community on behalf of those who are described as isolated children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although there are isolated children in our urban areas, obviously and naturally our concern is concentrated upon such children as live beyond the furthest fences, on the other side of the horizon as it were. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our report we highlighted the work that had been done in various ways on behalf of these children- through the great traditions of the School of the Air, the development of satellite communication for educational purposes, the development of radio communication, the programs which provide living away from home allowances, and the programs concerned with second homes, the programs for upgrading the skills of governesses or teachers in isolated areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certain programs which have been initiated by the present government and by the former Labor Government have developed facilities for the benefit of the isolated <span class="highlight">child</span> so that such children not only may be educated, as we understand that word, but also possess an appreciation of society in all of its aspects, all of its needs and all of its opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The motion which the honourable senator has put down tonight calls for our interest and responsible response in relation to the needs of children in our own country and throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children are, of course, one segment of a society which is made up of adults and older people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our involvement in the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> calls on us to have a responsibility to all sections of our community so that not only can they have a hope for their own future and a satisfaction in their own life, but also that those of us who are privileged to have favours and opportunities can share these with other people and thereby be deserving of our place on this earth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am too ashamed to talk about children outside Australia such as children in Africa who have been starved and enslaved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an Australian I am too ashamed to talk about children in Kampuchea and India who have been starved and killed; about children in South America who have been starved, enslaved, left without education and without hope; and about children in East Timor who have been starved and killed and, I believe, abandoned by Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I bring to the attention of the Senate the life and the environment of a section of our three million children who are under the age of 1 2 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of these children have never lived at home with their parents, or, at best, they have lived there for a short time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some have lived in the hospital in which they were born for very many years until, because of the death of another <span class="highlight">child</span>, a bed has become available in an institution and they have been discharged from that hospital and sent to the institution, the only home that they are ever destined to know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the children who in this rich, well ordered Australian community are born mentally or physically retarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the sort of dignity that our children are left with, that they are abandoned to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They live in institutions where they have no private rooms of their own to live in; they live in large communal dormitories, and they sleep in small iron baby cots that were designed for children up to the age of 18 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it any wonder that their parents live in despair and fear, and hate themselves for what they have done to their children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is little or no education for these children and there is little or no training of any kind for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose one can say that in the sort of society in which we live today there is not much hope for bright children who have gone through school, have passed their exams and have done well but who still do not have much of a future and will not have a job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those children who the community assesses as being permanently retarded may lead the community to say that it cannot afford to waste its resources on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What if a <span class="highlight">child</span> is not mentally retarded but physically retarded; he is physically retarded but fully intelligent, inside a stupid body that will not work, trapped inside a body and inside an institution? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the readiness of a growing <span class="highlight">child</span> with cerebral palsy to improve physically, mentally and spiritually, really depends on the freedom we give him to form a constructive selfimage as a person in his own right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Included among the requisite components are: Commencing intervention as early as possible in the <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s life; involving parents in their <span class="highlight">child</span>’s education; using a structured framework for curriculum design and teaching; formulating curriculum objectives around normal developmental sequences; conducting frequent criterion-referenced assessments of performance and using these data as a basis for decision making; having the program implemented by an integrated inter-disciplinary staff team: and providing follow-through programs for children as they advance beyond early intervention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister for Social Security received a submission from the ManlyWarringah Children’s Refuge Association requesting Federal Government assistance for the staffing of a children’s refuge in the ManlyWarringah district? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790918_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the importance of such facilities in this Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>, will the Government give funding assistance to this particular project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790918_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your honourable House will take no measures concerning the Royal Commission on Human Relationships Report that will further undermine and weaken marriage, <span class="highlight">child</span>-care or the family which according to the United Nations is ‘the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the state ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The broad intention of this aspect of the Bill is to ensure that an unmarried minor is not issued with a passport without steps having been taken to protect the rights of the <span class="highlight">child</span> and the rights of persons who have custody or guardianship of or access to the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have to say that in my electorate there have been a number of cases in which children have been taken by one spouse or by one partner in a dissolved relationship and that spouse or partner has left the country with the children without any reference to the other spouse or former partner to the great distress of that person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There simply are not effective controls on the ability of people to remove children from this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has proved to be no way in which the interests of the person remaining in Australia and that person’s right to access to that person’s children can be met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs,  Mr Andrew  Peacock, and the Attorney-General,  Senator Peter  Durack, QC, said today the new measures followed a detailed review of what legislative and administrative changes were necessary to reduce the incidence of <span class="highlight">child</span> removal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the number of <span class="highlight">child</span> removal cases does not appear to bc as high as the media reports suggest, the Government is concerned to make its legislation and administrative procedures as effective as possible to minimise the problem; ‘ the Ministers said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ministers said the prevention of <span class="highlight">child</span> removal was a complex matter involving questions of jurisdiction, dual nationality, citizenship, freedom of travel and rights of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I might add, that the <span class="highlight">child</span> concerned is beyond 18 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The freedom of the individual is recognised, but it is qualified, as it must always be, within our own society and within our own nation as subject to the rights of others as we see them- the rights of the spouse, the rights of the <span class="highlight">child</span>, the rights of the law in terms of breaches of the law- and subject to international rights and obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That office was concerned that there might be a possible duplication between the AIC allowances and payment by the Department of Social Security of the handicapped children’s benefit of $5 per day, that is, $35 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Family Allowance, Double Orphan’s Pension Handicapped <span class="highlight">Child</span>’s Allowance <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Payment is made, for the whole period, to the person or approved institution having the care of the <span class="highlight">child</span> on the first day of the pay period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This can mean that a person or institution having the care of a <span class="highlight">child</span> for the greater part of a period but not the commencement, receives nothing by way of family allowance in respect of that period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>family allowance apply also to the double orphan’s pension and the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance, but the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance is not payable to an institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently the absence of a <span class="highlight">child</span> from the family home for a few days covering the commencement of a family allowance period can result in the non-payment to the parent or guardian of amounts of $47.70 and $65 a month respectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To correct this the Government proposes that, where a <span class="highlight">child</span> moves from one person to another or enters or leaves an institution, entitlement will be decided on the basis of the number of days for which a <span class="highlight">child</span> is in the care of the person or institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s allowance the absence of a <span class="highlight">child</span> from the private home for a short period can be disregarded and payment continued uninterrupted provided family allowance continues to be payable to the parent or guardian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, under existing conditions, if a <span class="highlight">child</span> enters an institution to which family allowance is payable the parent or guardian loses handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed to amend the law to enable handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s allowance to be paid to the parent or guardian where the <span class="highlight">child</span> is in an endowed institution for a temporary period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as at present, the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s allowance will not be payable where handicapped children’s benefits or nursing home benefits is paid to an institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In order to qualify for a double orphan’s pension a person must be caring for a <span class="highlight">child</span>, other than a <span class="highlight">child</span> he has adopted, both of whose parents are no longer living, or one of whose parents is deceased and the other is not able, because of specified circumstances, to support the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While there is no barrier to payment of a double orphan’s pension where a <span class="highlight">child</span>, Australian born or otherwise, is awaiting adoption in Australia, it has never been the intention to pay the double orphan’s pension for any adopted <span class="highlight">child</span>, including those adopted under the laws of another country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless, today is International <span class="highlight">Child</span> ‘s Day and a lot of children are starving in the Australian community because their parents are starving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The first table demonstrates that the single income family in this country is below the poverty line on $ 140 a week with three or more children; on $160 a week, with four or more children; and on $ 1 80 a week, with five or more children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second list of low income families shows that the pensioner or the unemployed person with more than one <span class="highlight">child</span> is always below the poverty line if he has no income other than his pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the pensioner earns $20 a week he is lifted above the poverty line by that extra income but, even with $20 a week more, the unemployed person with two children or more remains in a poverty trap because of the low level of income allowed to the unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is also proposed under the regulations to refund half the amount of the charge where a course has run for no more than half its normal duration in any year and in the event of the death of the student, the withdrawal through serious illness of the student, the withdrawal through serious illness or death of a parent, spouse or <span class="highlight">child</span>, or the grant of resident status to the student. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In such cases the family allowance and the double orphan’s pension has gone to that institution, even though the <span class="highlight">child</span> might have been in the institution for only two days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the interests of children in Australia and around the world, particularly in developing countries, and as a matter of highest priority during the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-1-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I preface my question, which is addressed to the Minister for Social Security, by pointing out that Commonwealth support for the Children’s Services Program is by subsidy to selected <span class="highlight">child</span> care and family day care centres and has the effect of creating competition between subsidised and unsubsidised private <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres which operate in the same region; further, that the Commonwealth subsidy is designed to assist disadvantaged children, yet there are regions where only unsubsidised centres are situated, thus depriving disadvantaged children in that region of access to assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Will the Minister give consideration to applying the subsidy directly to disadvantaged children so that all such children can have access to the centre of their choice? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Children’s Services Program does provide a range of services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present we feel that there is an absence of reliable planning data necessary for the provision and use of <span class="highlight">child</span> care services on a regional basis throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have been working closely with commercial <span class="highlight">child</span> care service organisations, particularly where new grants are being made for subsidised <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter raised by the honourable senator would have to be subjected to examination by the Department and consideration by the Government in order to ascertain whether subsidies should be directly related to children and not to services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The provision in sub-section (2) of that section relating to a woman having custody, care and control of a <span class="highlight">child</span> under the age of 16 years, or to one who has attained the age of 50 years, is simply to be deleted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Grimes  seems to think that she qualifies for a widow’s pension, but would a woman who was 30 years of age and who had the care and custody of a <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 years of age, and a husband who was in such a home, qualify? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One assumes that it means that people have been bringing children into this country after adopting them in other countries under conditions and laws not acceptable under the laws of this country; when they have got the children here they have been claiming a double orphan’s pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How many people have actually brought children in under their care as adopted children and then claimed a double orphan’s pension when they have got here? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By adding this definition people who have adopted children under the laws of other countries will be precluded from receiving the double orphans ‘ pension for that <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was felt necessary to add this definition so that when children are adopted under the laws of other countries they would not be eligible for the double orphan’s pension when they come to live in Australia with their adoptive parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Grimes  stated, the Government wishes to return to the days before <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and before other benefits which are now accepted in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government does not do anything by the next election, every mother of five children will be told by me and others that the Government has taken away $500 a year from her because it has failed to index family allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A mother of four children will have lost approximately $400 a year; a mother of three children approximately $270 a year; a mother of two children approximately $160 a year and a mother of one <span class="highlight">child</span> approximately $70 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The old <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment scheme and the tax rebate system were abolished and replaced with the family allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For example, a sole parent with one <span class="highlight">child</span> may currently receive either $73.20 or $75.20 a week rather than the $64.20 a week which is shown on the table. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw attention to the fact that the figures for other family payments would show similar differences if the other allowances that are available to those with dependent children were included in the table. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Also, does the Government intend to establish, and assist in the funding of, a committee representative of interested groups in the Australian community to undertake research and to publicise the second Special Session on Disarmament in 1 980, along lines similar to those of committees established for the International Women’s Year and the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-71-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of International Women’s Year and the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>, the international community required governments to promote national activities and it was appropriate for the Government to sponsor and to assist in funding committees established by Non-Governmental Organisations to support these two years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-71-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The draft Order on <span class="highlight">Child</span> Resistant Containers, proposed for promulgation under the Commonwealth Therapeutic Goods Act, will include a provision exempting prescribed drugs from the necessity of being supplied in a <span class="highlight">child</span>-resistant container in cases where the prescriber or dispenser believes the patient would suffer undue hardship through difficulty in opening a container complying with the requirements of the Order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-59-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The requirement for <span class="highlight">child</span>-resistant containers will not apply to ali drugs, but only to those categories of drugs which have been demonstrated to be a significant cause of <span class="highlight">child</span> poisonings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-59-32">[More…]</a></p>
