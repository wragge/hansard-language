  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Social Services whether it is true that in Victoria alone the number of names on the waiting list of State residential centres for mentally retarded children stands at approximately 1,433 and is growing by 100 or more per year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister agree that this state of affairs represents a desperate situation to the parents of these unfortunate children and other members of their families and places a tremendous strain on the health of the parents caring for the retarded? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, will he consider making available under the home health services such services as those of social workers, physiotherapists, teachers and speech therapists, and will he consider giving financial assistance to parents whose <span class="highlight">child</span> requires these services? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>and (3) The safety aspects of <span class="highlight">child</span> restraints for use in motor vehicles were considered at the 31st meeting of the Australian Transport Advisory Council, held on 23rd February 1970. ft was noted that at the present time thereis no recognised standard for <span class="highlight">child</span> restraints, but that the Standards Association of Australia has prepared a draft standard for public review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State Ministers at the meeting undertook to raise the question of appropriate legislation for <span class="highlight">child</span> restraints which their respective State Governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-11">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Clause 4 amends the Act to make provision for divorced persons with dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme is being extended to include divorced persons less than 36 years of age with 1 or more dependent children who have entered into a contract to buy or build a home on or after 27th October 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clause defines a dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> and makes provisions with regard to traditional savings somewhat similar to those that apply in the case of widowed persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Acceptable savings will include an approved interest held in the name of the divorced person and any children of the dissolved marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation is now being further broadened to bring divorced persons with children within its scope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the ‘Family Needs Allowance’ now paid to New Guinean public servants employed by the Administration of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea in each part of the Territory in which a different rate applies in respect of family units of fa) man and wife, (b) man and wife and one <span class="highlight">child</span>, (c) man and wife and two children, (d) man and wife and three children and (e) man and wife and more than three children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-29-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The following table sets out the scales of ‘prescribed minimum pay’ from which family needs allowance is calculated in respect of family units of (a) man and wife, (b) man and wife and one <span class="highlight">child</span>, (c) man and wife and two children and (d) man and wife and three children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-29-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think consideration should be given by all parties concerned with handicapped children to the proposal that children should be placed in schools far earlier than they are now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much of the damage is done to these children because they do not go to special schools early enough and naturally their parents lend to spoil them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I heard of a <span class="highlight">child</span> who could not feed himself even though he was 6 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">child</span>’s treatment would have been so much better if he had received assistance at an earlier age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that it is not only a question of reaching the <span class="highlight">child</span> but teaching the parent as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It affects every person in the Parliament just as it affects every man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia and as it will affect future generations of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700609_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are fees paid by working mothers to pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres allowable as a tax deduction; if not, why not <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-53-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> was unaware of any other incident involving the aircraft and it was pure chance that the two happenings were coincident. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-31-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did a 6-year old <span class="highlight">child</span> accidentally pull an exit lever and open an escape window on an Ansett DC9 aircraft at Sydney Airport on 14th May 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-31-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, did the <span class="highlight">child</span> or the parent pull the lever as a diversion during an incident on the aircraft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-31-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The full-year cost in 1970-71 of  increasing  the weekly rates of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment by $1 per <span class="highlight">child</span> is estimated to be $216m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-42-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since September 1968, the Commonwealth Government has paid to parents an annual subsidy of $100 for each <span class="highlight">child</span> in the Northern Territory under the age of 12, who, because of distance from a school, studies at home under the supervision of a governess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-4-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The subsidy is also paid if the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s lessons are supervised by the mother and domestic help is employed to free the mother for this supervision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-4-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Based on the number of pensions current at 29th March 1971, the estimated cost of increasing to S3.50 per week the additional pensions paid to civilian widow pensioners in respect of the eldest eligible <span class="highlight">child</span> would be $2.4m per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It appears that the average Aboriginal family has approximately 6 children to a white family’s 3 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aboriginal mothers lack the training and knowledge to provide children with proper pre-natal and post-natal care and this results in an extreme danger period for infant mortality between the ages of 6 months and 4 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The medical officer at Collarenebri District Hospital,  Dr Kalokerinos,  put forward the theory that lack of proper nutritional diet, together with lack of immunity to European diseases and the appalling housing conditions that continually cause re-infection once a <span class="highlight">child</span> has been brought back to health, were major factors in the high incidence of ill health and infant mortality among Aboriginal children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, even if death did not occur at an early age - I stress this as a most important point - these constant illnesses of Aboriginal children caused by lack of proper nutritional diet were primary factors in Aboriginals in many instances having a mental development below that of their white counterparts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By the time an Aboriginal <span class="highlight">child</span> had reached school age it was often 2 or 3 years behind its white contemporaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 venture to say that milk is the most important food item in India and in many of these other countries today, particularly insofar as the women and children are concerned, because there is just nothing to supplement the mother’s milk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is where the high mortality rate exists - not at the infant level, but after the <span class="highlight">child</span> has been weaned, that is, between the ages of 1 and 5 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The facts of the first leg of the comparison are that the two Administration officers were admitted to bail to await their trial before the Supreme Court on a charge of unlawfully doing grievous bodily harm to a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Millions of the world’s children suffer from malnutrition; that the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">child</span> is no exception is suggested by a series of reports describing the situation in our own country, published by G. M. Maxwell and R. B. Elliott in 1969, by E. S. Kettle in 1966 and by D. G. Jose and J. S. Welch in this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever the name given to the condition - ‘protein-calorie’ malnutrition, infantile marasmus, ‘postweaning’ growth failure, or what have you - the end result is the same: The <span class="highlight">child</span> is substantially below expected levels of height and weight for age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The parameter of age is important in the diagnosis, lt is not uncommon perhaps to see fairly well-covered children, who superficially look normal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever controversies there may be about the assimilation or integration of Aboriginals or about Aboriginal land rights, there ought to be no controversy about their health, especially the health of their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No doubt he spoke with great eloquence and sincerity, but the thought ran through my mind, as he gave statistics, whether, if a question were asked of the various people who admit to being victims of abortion, they would have carried the <span class="highlight">child</span> had there been an adequate family income, had there been a suitable home, and had there been some sense of social security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It well behoves the nation to give assistance to those people who are prepared to produce children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this it was made quite clear that the District Commissioner had interjected to correct a statement made by the Leader of the Opposition in Rabaul that a native <span class="highlight">child</span> had been killed during revolver practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the incidents mentioned then concerns an incident he refers to here in his statement - not the killing, thank goodness, of the indigenous <span class="highlight">child</span> but, as he said, the injuring of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question at issue is not whether the statement I made was correct - whether the indigenous <span class="highlight">child</span> was killed or caused grievous bodily harm or unlawfully wounded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the real point made by the Leader of the Opposition was this: Here was a young man who was out on bail after having been accused of shooting a native <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole gravamen of the statement by the Leader of the Opposition was that no native would be out on bail and attached to our party as a photographer if he had shot a European <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition went on, after stating how he came to be at this Council’s Executive, to say that he believed that the question before this House today was not whether what he had said there was correct - that the <span class="highlight">child</span> was killed or that the <span class="highlight">child</span> was maliciously wounded or that the <span class="highlight">child</span> was unlawfully wounded; these were the 3 categories he posed as being the possible alternatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did not use the words that the wounding had been accidental, that the revolver practice had been carried out negligently and that the <span class="highlight">child</span> had been wounded completely accidentally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also said that a very different set of circumstances would have prevailed had it been a European <span class="highlight">child</span> that he wounded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us move on to the other point, the quibble about the wounding of a native <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is serious, that the native <span class="highlight">child</span> was wounded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am putting to the House that the Government is trying to make a serious issue out of this and a challenge on the basis that, to say that a <span class="highlight">child</span> was killed is a critical allegation but to say that he was merely wounded is only insignificant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable members in the Government’s ranks, the <span class="highlight">child</span> who was wounded was very close to death. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A fraction of an inch one way or the other would have meant the death of the <span class="highlight">child</span>, and the Government is trying to quibble that it was not important - the <span class="highlight">child</span> was only wounded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government supporters find great humour in this, that a <span class="highlight">child</span> missed death by a fraction of an inch. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They find cause for laughter and great levity in the fact that the <span class="highlight">child</span> was not killed, that he missed death only by a fraction of an inch. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An aged pensioner is not paid a wife’s allowance if she is under the age of 60 unless she and her husband have at least one <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 in their care, or the husband is incapacitated or is 70 years of age and not fully employed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, there is the case of a husband who is hospitalised and whose wife is under 60 years of age and is supporting young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the purposes of this example we assume that she has two young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She may have nowhere to leave her children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only 1 <span class="highlight">child</span> in 13 in Australia is able to attend a <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare centre which is up to government standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to a recent report from the Department of Labour and National Service there are only two <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres in Australia operated by employers, and they are in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So unless this woman has relatives or friends she will not be able to farm her children out during the day in working hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All she would have would be <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment of $6.50 a week plus a pension allowance for her children making a total of about $7.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is made up of the standard rate pension, supplementary assistance, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and pension allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am assuming that she has 2 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will not have anyone, adult or <span class="highlight">child</span>, being forced to live on less than the minimum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this Government doing anything about <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could have a system of subsidies paid to families on a sliding scale according to the number of childdren they have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, on the birth of a fourth <span class="highlight">child</span> $1,000 might be deducted from the mortgage on a home; $1,500 on the birth of a fifth <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(a) Under the concessional deduction provisions of the income tax law, deductions for education expenses, including the cost of necessary books and fees, are allowable to a tax payer where the expenses are necessarily incurred by him for or in connection with the fulltime education of a person who is less than 21 years of age and is a <span class="highlight">child</span> of the taxpayer or is a person for whom the taxpayer is entitled to a dependant’s deduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-32-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are setting out to give everybody an equal opportunity in life, we should bear in mind that, if we give a <span class="highlight">child</span> from an underprivileged family the same education as a <span class="highlight">child</span> who has an adequate home environment, the <span class="highlight">child</span> from the underprivileged family will make less of that same education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, to give both children the same opportunity in life, we must give additional educational assistance to the underprivileged one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is the taxation deduction for student children only allowable whilst the <span class="highlight">child</span> is under the age of 21 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely this is an unrealistic provision when a <span class="highlight">child</span>, under our more advanced secondary school system, stays at school until 18 or 19 years of age before going to university. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under present arrangements <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare,, broadly speaking, is a function pf the States rather than of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There, are exceptions to this, of course - for example the $1.50 per day payment which the Commonwealth makes in respect of the accommodation away from home of certain handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is vital that help be given to these handicapped people early in life, because a <span class="highlight">child</span> - even an infant - is easier to train than an adult. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The experts told me: ‘If only we could have started to train them in childhood how much more we could have done, and how much easier it would have been’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are few people who feel no compassion for the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> - for the <span class="highlight">child</span> who, because of severe physical disability or mental retardation, may be denied the joys of childhood, the .adventures of adolescence and the experience of taking his place in the society of his , fellow men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This measure is designed to help these children - but not these children only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those honourable members who  have had any contact with parents of handicapped children, and I am sure there are few who have not, will know something of the burden they bear - willingly - but nevertheless a burden that can change the whole pattern of their lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The weekly rate of compensation for an employee is being increased from 28.15 to $31.80 and will be supplemented by an additional $7.70 for a dependent wife or husband and $2.80 for each <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present allowable tax deduction of $300 for education expenses for each <span class="highlight">child</span> is inadequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is of the standard of one or two others that I have seen and it depicts a <span class="highlight">child</span> - if it is a <span class="highlight">child</span> - or a woman killed quite probably by the Vietcong, lt follows the usual pattern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the matter is highlighted immediately by referring to the Consolidated Revenue Fund which shows that the amount extracted from every man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> in New South Wales, and indeed in Australia, is $553 and that the reimbursment to New South Wales to carry on essential services is a mere $80 per head. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amount expended there by the State of New South Wales - and this is no indictment of it because it has not sufficient funds to spend any more - is little more than the cost of supplying primary school children with a bottle of milk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such a <span class="highlight">child</span> will probably follow the general pattern and leave school at the age of 16 years with at best a grade V or grade VI education - much the same as he or she would have had 20 or 25 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>(i) The annual school equipment fees were introduced in 1967; they have remained at the rate of $1 per <span class="highlight">child</span> at primary schools and $3 per <span class="highlight">child</span> for pupils at secondary schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where more than1 <span class="highlight">child</span> from a family attend a school, the total fee payable is $1 at primary and S3 at secondary schools, <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the Council’s advice the fee varies from sub-district to sub-district from $10 per <span class="highlight">child</span> a year to a maximum of $30 depending upon the level of economic development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By way of preface, may I refer to a statement made by the Minister some months ago with regard to the possibility of introducing a national <span class="highlight">child</span> minding scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has approved details of a comprehensive programme of migrant education which will strengthen existing provisions and give effect to the policy announced by the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  on 8th October 1969 of Commonwealth financial support for new, improved and expanded facilities for the instruction of <span class="highlight">child</span> and adult migrants in the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister’s statement that the Government will enlarge the <span class="highlight">child</span> education programme and will extend it to include adults, both before and after entry, is something which all honourable members must welcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the teacher has just as big a problem in endeavouring to convey his impressions or his knowledge to the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst we deal with the problems of children and teachers and questions relating to the social and economic integration of migrants, at this stage there appears to be a much more lively interest being taken by the Government and organisations in the education of adult migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Man and wife and one <span class="highlight">child</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-33-81">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So free insurance would go to each lower income earner with a wife and family of 2 children and on a wage of $45 gross per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For every <span class="highlight">child</span> above the 2 children in the case of a man with a gross income of $45 an additional $3 could be earned without affecting entitlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would mean that a family with 6 children could have a gross income of $57 and still get free insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So our system would be based upon income of $45 per week for a man, wife and 2 children, allowing him an extra $3 income according to each <span class="highlight">child</span> above those 2. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Nimmo Committee’s proposals a low income earner with a wife and 2 children could earn the minimum wage of $42.50 and could then be allowed an extra $4 a week for each <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 80c charge in itself will be sufficient to cause a parent, particularly if he is in poor circumstances, to have second thoughts or to ponder whether it is really necessary to take his <span class="highlight">child</span> to a doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He may decide to wait until the next day to see how the <span class="highlight">child</span> is, but the next day may be just too late or, at the very best, the sickness may have developed into something that is serious. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It points out that the increasing emphasis on individual teaching in primary schools means that resource facilities such as books, films, recordings, charts and autoinstructional programmes should be readily available in sufficient quantity to provide for the needs of each <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is vital to the development of the individual <span class="highlight">child</span> that the necessary facilities be available, not only in secondary schools, but also during the formative years of primary schooling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the provision of more, and more easily accessible, special classes and centres with the trained teachers and equipment necessary for the retarded and lower capacity <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is a fact that the presence of these children in normal primary school classes makes their own progress almost impossible and makes the work of the teacher and the progress of the other children in the class extremely difficult. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a besetting problem in many primary schools in my own State and causes considerable concern among teachers and parents of retarded children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result is that many children in desperate need of urgent remedial treatment in one or another area of their learning life suffer grave injustices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Social Services a question about the provision of assistance for <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres catering for the mentally retarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 understand that his Department subsidises day training centres for mentally retarded children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been suggested that assistance to <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres is the next logical extension of a programme to help these unfortunate members of our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member will be aware, there is at present before the House the Handicapped Children (Assistance) Bill, under which the Commonwealth will provide a $2 for $1 capital subsidy to institutions giving training to handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If training is given to children coming within the definition of handicapped, which includes mentally handicapped as well as physically handicapped, the institution will be eligible, upon the passage of the legislation, for a capital subsidy of $2 for $1. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has been giving some consideration to helping <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The weekly rate of compensation for a seaman is being increased from $28.15 to $31.80 and there is provision also for increases in weekly rates from $6.80 to $7.70 for a seaman’s wife and from $2.50 to $2.80 for each of a seaman’s children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The basic lump sum death benefit, to which other lump sum benefits for various injuries are related, is being increased from $10,000 to $12,000, and the minimum total payment for a dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> rises from $200 to $280. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, a widow with the actual income of $1,950 may be supporting a <span class="highlight">child</span> and have other concessional deductions of $42 in which case her taxable income would be $1,700. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A matron in charge of a <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centre could not possibly qualify for the male rate because mcn do not act as matrons in charge of <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Men do not have the ability, as women have, to be in charge of <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us consider the position of a family that unfortunately has a <span class="highlight">child</span> with a squint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The specialist examines the <span class="highlight">child</span>, and it is as thorough an examination as that made by any other specialist in any part of the medical profession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The common practice in this unfortunate ailment, commonly known as a squint - I am afraid 1 do not know the medical term - is for the <span class="highlight">child</span> to be required to come back in 3 months time when the specialist will again examine him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we all know a significant number of females in Australia conceive their first <span class="highlight">child</span> outside marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She should not have to show that she was contributing to the fund at the family rate for 10 months before giving birth to a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under these recommendations, a person with more than 2 children, on the minimum wage would be allowed an additional $4 a week per <span class="highlight">child</span>- and would obtain cover for health insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would mean that a person with 6 children and earning $58.50 a week would be receiving some cover if those recommendations had been upheld. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the basis put forward by the Nimmo Committee there was a clear case of want for a man, a wife and 6 children trying to exist on $58.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means that <span class="highlight">child</span>-bearing and <span class="highlight">child</span>-rearing are recognised as offences by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the case of a <span class="highlight">child</span> whose life was at stake because there was only 1 antibiotic available for a case of pneumonia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> specialist in charge of the case, who was qualified and registered in the State of Queensland, had to make out a case for prescribing this drug. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The parents of the <span class="highlight">child</span>, who could ill afford to pay for the drug and who really should have had their <span class="highlight">child</span> in a public hospital if the specialist had been available there, had to pay several hundred dollars for this one drug to treat this fairly long and critical illness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> was saved and I have no doubt that the parents are very thankful that this happened and were willing to pay this money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill,  Mr Speaker,  relates to the total area of migrant education, which lor purposes of simplicity may be dealt with under 3 main headings - the adult programme, intensive courses and <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education programme represents a new area of Commonwealth participation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government intends to finance the salaries of special teachers in both existing Government and independent schools to teach migrant children who are handicapped in varying degrees by some type of English language difficulty and the cost of special training courses for these teachers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will provide suitable teaching and learning materials not only to schools where special classes are formed but also to schools where there are insufficient numbers of migrant children with language problems to justify the appointment of a special teacher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because what is planned in the adult programme and with intensive courses is essentially an extension of existing programmes, the Bill is concerned largely with the area of the major new initiative in <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 5 relates to the proposed new arrangements for the <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education programme as well as to existing arrangements for adult migrants and for fulltime intensive courses of instruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of Education and Science, which will be assisting in the development of the <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education programme in the States and will be responsible for producing appropriate teaching materials, will be establishing a committee to advise on the design and content and production of text books and other material for the <span class="highlight">child</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Full-scale production of material designed specifically for <span class="highlight">child</span> migrants will possibly take two to three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime selected materials already used in the adult programme will be made available for use by migrant children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I referred in my statement to the House on 23rd April to the need for research in the fields of both adult and <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>of clause 9 relates to certain types of payments, which it was thought desirable to refer to specifically, with respect to arrangements entered into with the government of a State - under both the adult programme and the <span class="highlight">child</span> programme - as well as with an independent school authority under the <span class="highlight">child</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt may be useful if I were to explain that schools which will qualify for financial assistance under the special programme for <span class="highlight">child</span> migrants will be those where a special teacher is employed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The appointment of a special teacher will in turn require, as a general rule, a minimum of 30 migrant children in the school in need of special instruction in the English language - though the children may be taught in smaller groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Administrative staff in the case of the <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant programme will be concerned essentially with policy formulation, the control, training and development of teaching staff and the inspection and supervision of the programme at the local level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>of clause 9 is intended to provide for the situation where the State Education Department or independent school authority may wish to purchase teaching and learning materials which are not suitable for production under the arrangement referred to in clause 5 but which may be considered necessary to the effective implementation  of  the <span class="highlight">child</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We expect to spend $150,000 on intensive courses during 1969-70 and $250,000 on the <span class="highlight">child</span> programme during the final quarter of the financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So far as the Commonwealth Government is concerned, a benefit of $1.50 per <span class="highlight">child</span> per day is payable to charitable and religious organisations conducting approved homes accommodating and caring for physically and mentally handicapped children under 16 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-31-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No doubt many retire because of marriage, but little is done to establish the best way of encouraging them back into the profession - for example, by the provision of re-training programmes at Government expense or <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres set up close to their employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 addressed this House only recently on the subject of profoundly deaf children and return to it for 2 reasons: firstly, because of the general unawareness and ignorance that abound on the problem of deafness and secondly, because of the widespread, long-standing neglect of deaf children by Federal and State governments, and I might add, by society generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They would, I am sure, be stunned, as I was, by the realisation of the fact that the <span class="highlight">child</span> born totally deaf - and otherwise normal - comes into the world with a burden of staggering proportions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consider this single fact: A <span class="highlight">child</span> with normal hearing at the age of 4 or 5 years has all the basic structure of his native language without ever having been taught, solely by being communicated with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can a <span class="highlight">child</span> who is born profoundly deaf learn his native language? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further enlightenment might come to an outsider by considering that what 1 might term ‘the old fashioned deafness’ - cases when deafness was a single handicap - is giving way to the more complex problem of the growing population of the multiple handicapped deaf children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned as my second reason for addressing honourable members on the problem of the profoundly deaf <span class="highlight">child</span> the widespread and long-standing neglect by both Federal and State government We are, all of us, familiar with the thinking of not so many years ago that put ali these human problems into the dark backwaters of institutionalisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although speaking as an outsider in this field I hope I am speaking for a society that is ashamed that it has looked the other way for so long when the problem of the profoundly deaf <span class="highlight">child</span> has been mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are classes that are overcrowded by 30 or 40 at first form level, and it is simply impossible these days for those children to be taught. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When a matriculation class has 20 or 30 more students than it should have, the effect on the <span class="highlight">child</span> being taught in that class is disastrous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the Government is prepared to say to the Australian people: ‘We need X qualified teachers if we are to give every young Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> the full opportunuity to develop his innate potentiality’ and if it is prepared to argue this way for 3 years, the Australian people will not object to an increase in taxation if there are no other means of raising revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill proposes certain grants towards capital costs on the basis of $2 for each $1 on the conditions outlined in the Bill and also towards the purchase of approved equipment for centres which are dedicated to the training and rehabilitation of handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of an expansion in the definition of a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> it not only includes a person under 21 years but in some cases it includes a person over 21 years, where that person has had continuous training in that centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our casual attitude and quite inadequate approach to the needs of the physically, mentally and socially handicapped children is contrary to the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>, principle 5, which states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">child</span> who is physically, mentally or socially handicapped shall be given the special treatment, education and care required by his particular condition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the sorts of things that ought to be grappled with if we are to talk eulogistically and with self-praise about what is being done by the Federal Government for handicapped children and for the unfortunate parents who have tq bear the burden of handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my city of Ipswich in one case a father works during the day as a truck driver and the mother works at night in a woollen mill so that between them they can have enough money tn maintain all the services that are necessary for their <span class="highlight">child</span> who is gravely handicapped to meet the costs of his transport to and from Brisbane and the cost of special equipment, special books and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What about pre-school centres for these children, perhaps mixed pre-school centres? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Goodness only knows that normal children are not able to obtain sufficient pre-school training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No provision has been made for the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet they are children, precisely because they tend to be slow learners, who must start earlier at school and who must obtain the special preliminary training which goes with a pre-school centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everywhere I travel, and Australia has been no exception, there is plentiful evidence of the fact that all too many physicians do not inform parents at all that their <span class="highlight">child</span> was at or soon after birth recognised to be mentally retarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Others inform parents that their <span class="highlight">child</span> is backward but should grow out of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some physicians go to the other extreme and, particularly in cases of mongolism, paint an entirely unjustifiable dark and dismal picture of the <span class="highlight">child</span> as a total idiot, unable to function even in the simplest life tasks, and urge immediate and total separation from the mother and admission to an institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But once having achieved this, or concurrently anyway with such a programme, great virtues would be found in establishing a register in which handicapped children could be registered at birth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only the mentally retarded but also other handicapped children would be registered and then handicaps identified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  education  of  children is  a  society responsi bility and therefore a Government responsibility - whether the <span class="highlight">child</span> happens to have  an  IQ of  40 or 140,  and in this so-called age of enlightenment it should not be necessary to have to justify such a statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suffice to say that at present, society, through its government is making provision for the education of subnormal children on the cheap. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hitherto, <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare has always been regarded as the responsibility of the States and the voluntary organisations, although the Commonwealth has been paying $1.50 per day as a subsidy towards the accommodation of certain handicapped children who are living away from home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the States and voluntary organisations have had to bear the bulk of the costs and responsibility of looking after the handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The New South Wales Government has involved itself in a direct manner in assisting handicapped children, caring for State wards and providing school facilities and of course it will not be eligible to receive direct assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We hope that this Bill will give a broad interpretation to the term ‘handicapped children’ so that it will include those mentally disabled because they are emotionally and socially maladjusted children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is desirable that every effort be made to provide special schooling and other forms of care and training for emotionally disturbed children who may not need inpatient care in psychiatric hospitals but who will become serious problems to all concerned if they are not given special assistance at an early age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The prime objective has been to encourage regional development of social services throughout the State so that services for handicapped children are located where the children’s families are living or to assist within the immediate region so that family involvement can be maintained with the needs of the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are 11 such regional advisory committees in New South Wales consisting of representatives of education and public health bodies and <span class="highlight">child</span> and social welfare officers, to help guide and advise the New South Wales Government and local workers for the cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the objectives of the Westhaven Association in moving to extend the accommodation at the hostel is to qualify for the application of the Commonwealth handicapped children’s benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year the association made representations, through myself, to the Commonwealth Minister for Health  (Dr Forbes)  about the restrictive criteria under which the Commonwealth Government’s benefit for handicapped children was granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tn reply to these representations the Minister stated that the requirements for the application of this benefit had been eased and as a result the Westhaven Association is now confident that when the additions to the hostel are completed it will be eligible for the Commonwealth handicapped children’s benefit of $1.50 per day per <span class="highlight">child</span> in residence at the hostel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>School facilities will be acceptable only if the schools receive certification under the Public Instruction Act, while residential facilities for children or pre-school kindergarten facilities require to be licensed under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Welfare Act of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Permanently handicapped children of past days were hidden in the back room and not brought out to the light of day, as though it was some blemish upon their character or something to be ashamed of for a <span class="highlight">child</span> to be deformed or affected in some way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have said, these children in the past were put at the bottom of the class and were looked down upon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no doubt that in the past parents of these children have suffered tremendously and have borne the brunt without help of any kind from governments or anywhere else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is doing much at the present time, but there is still a great need to find out exactly the extent of the problem, not only of handicapped children about whom we are talking in this Bill but also of handicapped people in all aspects and in all grades throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When speaking of handicapped children I mean children with physical as well as mental handicaps, lt is not possible to divorce the needs of the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> from the needs of the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The needs of the family are the most urgent in the early years of the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill does nothing to assist the family or the <span class="highlight">child</span> during this period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many parents, given assistance at this stage of the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s life, could later cope with many of the problems which drive them to seek hospital placement as the only means of preventing a complete family breakdown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Voluntary organisations have undertaken almost too willingly the care and education of, in particular, mentally handicapped children from the pre-school years through to the sheltered workshop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, no Government expects voluntary organisations to undertake the education of non-handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A family with a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> is a handicapped family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Looking at it in its best light, this Bil) imposes an additional burden on the parents of handicapped children who, in the main, make up the voluntary organisations which will seek subsidies for the new day centres and residential referred to in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Normal children are held back and the health of the parents is undermined by the tremendous strain of caring for the retarded member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The burdens carried by these families include high medical costs, high transport costs, special safety measures in the home, excessive laundry costs, costs of excessive clothing replacements and other excessive costs which may be incurred by the condition of a particular <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the need for residential accommodation for these people is very great, lt could be lessened if a range of community services were available to help these families to keep a <span class="highlight">child</span> at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such community services could include visiting social workers, physiotherapists, teacher and speech therapist services, financial assistance to the family whose <span class="highlight">child</span>’s condition requires this, a home help service - especially with trained personnel - and a visiting nursing service for the very young and for the bedridden or almost totally dependent <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There should also be compulsory medical examinations under the national health service for all 4-year-olds to enable earlier assessment of children with special needs due to a disability and hostel accommodation for the aged, orphans, and others unable to live at home for any reason, such as illness, age of parent, distance from a facility, condition of handicapped person in relation to other members of the family, size of family, etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is vital that help be given to these handicapped people early in life, because a <span class="highlight">child</span> - even an infant - is easier to train than an adult. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>In all these cases the training must be given to the <span class="highlight">child</span> at a very early age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>both the States and voluntary bodies have been making valiant efforts in this field of assistance to handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I remind the Minister again of the particular category of handicapped persons which I discussed with him earlier in the week and which I understand will be regarded with a degree of flexibility in future interpretations of what is a ‘handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In clause 4 of the Bill the definition of a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> covers children under 21 years of age in an institution  3S  well as children over 21 years of agc who enter the institution before they reach that age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The flexibility which I urge the Minister to consider concerns the <span class="highlight">child</span> who has remained with his parents and sickness or death makes it impossible for the <span class="highlight">child</span> to remain at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Minda Home has been accepting very large numbers of children in this category for the Christmas vacation and this experiment is appreciated by the children and by the parents who, of course, are able to have a rest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those of us who are fortunate enough to have normal children can scarcely imagine the feelings of parents when- they take a decision regarding the future of their handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They must decide whether to rear the <span class="highlight">child</span> at home or place him in an institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are many, such as the tireless workers for the Mentally Retarded Childrens Society of South Australia, who opt for keeping them at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The importance placed on early training and specialised education, and the Home’s success, in actually placing former mentally handicapped children in full employment, has meant that many children ultimately will be able to lead a normal life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When there is even a possibility of eventual success the decision regarding the future of a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> is perhaps slightly less difficult to make. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every single <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia has a right to an education that will develop all of its capacities no matter how extensive they are or how limited they are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed the more limited is the capacity the greater the need for that <span class="highlight">child</span>’s rights to be recognised by this Government, by a State government or by somebody - just so long as somebody does recognise it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At present everybody recognises that a normal <span class="highlight">child</span> has a right to develop to a stage of education which will bring out all of his capacities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you look beyond the normal <span class="highlight">child</span> and ask yourself: What about the <span class="highlight">child</span> that goes to the spastic centre, the one that goes to the school for the mentally retardedorthe one that goes to special school? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How does this come about when it is the handi apped <span class="highlight">child</span> especially who needs the special ist training, the physiotherapist, the speech therapist, the occupational therapist and the trained teacher? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">child</span>’s parents probably need a social welfare worker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The teacher probably also needs a psychologist to watch the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s progress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set these things as the standard of what the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> needs and you can guarantee that the <span class="highlight">child</span> has not got them, This is simply because nobody in  Australiais  prepared to accept full responsibil ity for the education of handicapped children <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Once again, it is the country citizen who becomes the second class citizen because many of the advantages and many of the rights which the city handicapped ch id has the country handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> does not have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This type of accommodation is necessary because, as many honourable members are already aware, one of the greatest worries of the parents of handicapped children is what will happen to the handicapped children if the mother or father becomes ill or dies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From time to time there is also a need for the parents to have a holiday, and in that case it is essential for the <span class="highlight">child</span> to have somewhere to stay while the parents are having a rest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On those grounds alone it is essential that there should be hostel accommodation, and for the mentally retarded children in my electorate this is a great need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the problems which confront the parents of handicapped children, whether they are handicapped physically or mentally or in both respects, is the problem that this disability creates in the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In areas such as the one I represent where large distances are involved the task of taking handicapped children from one place to another adds to the very great problems that confront parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He referred to it as infantile autism because he meant it occurred mainly in children under 3 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cause of it is still a mystery; the symptoms of the illness are many and varied and not always applicable to all children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said before, it is extremely difficult to diagnose because there are no set symptoms but a pattern of symptoms that exists and it can only be recognised in a <span class="highlight">child</span> when a conglomeration of these symptoms occurs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears that there are about 14 major manifestations of infantile autism and it is generally accepted that if a <span class="highlight">child</span> shows 7 or more of these symptoms he is likely to be austistic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taken out of context these symptoms can occur in other diseases or in perfectly normal children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to outline briefly the symptoms that do occur in an autistic <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> is not as cuddly as a baby and tends to hold itself, stiff or alternatively hangs rather limply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the great problems with the autistic <span class="highlight">child</span> is its inability to communicate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have great difficulty in playing with other children and they also look past or away from the person to whom they are talking or who is talking to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are restless children, rushing from one thing to another ali the time and they often act as if deaf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This final aspect is a great worry to parents who have to watch the children constantly as they may run out onto a street and under a car where there is heavy traffic passing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many other dangers of which the <span class="highlight">child</span> is not aware and with which it will become involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One other symptom of an autistic <span class="highlight">child</span> is the swaying or rocking that occurs very often during the evening- for teng periods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been attracted to the profoundly deaf who, along with the spastic children, offer the greatest’ potential in training and achievement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All handicapped children require our attention, consideration and understanding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The impact’ of profound congenital hearing loss on the processes of communication is difficult to overestimate, because language is the indispensable tool of learning which is acquired with very little effort by the hearing <span class="highlight">child</span> but acquired in a minimal degree by the deaf <span class="highlight">child</span> only after great effort and determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been estimated that deafness is the most profound handicap a <span class="highlight">child</span> may have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Deaf children in Australia have shared the treatment meted out to handicapped children generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer to the basic question: What do we have to do to ensure adequate provision for our deaf children?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of prime importance is a programme of early attention to the deaf <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without such early attention it is doubtful whether a <span class="highlight">child</span> who is born deaf will ever acquire his native language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is doubtful if even 1% of the cost of educating deaf children is spent on research. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can recollect first coming into this field and becoming interested in it many, many years ago when a couple who had a mongoloid <span class="highlight">child</span> approached me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> was 2 years of age and had not turned off its back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The father approached me to try to get the <span class="highlight">child</span> into a State home to be looked after because at that point of time his total wage- was 13 10s a week, and he was spending 6 a week having that <span class="highlight">child</span> looked after in a private home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought I could easily get that <span class="highlight">child</span> into a home- how innocent I was- -where it would be looked after. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was one State organisation where the <span class="highlight">child</span> was finally admitted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having had 5 attacks of pneumonia the <span class="highlight">child</span> had a sixth attack and died within a fortnight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason I became very vitally interested in this problem of handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to look after these children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is our <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it does not have the same effect upon government instrumentalities, which should accept the responsibility for these children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>those people who are prepared, to volunteer to assist these children to raise, other finance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is becoming increasingly difficult for the ordinary family - group to meet its responsibilities to those children who are not physically handicapped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here they are being called upon to meet this colossal responsibility - this great liability of the <span class="highlight">child</span> who is handicapped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So many of these children need special vehicles to transport them to and from school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a need to alleviate this problem and to assist not only those children under 16 years of age but those over 16 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under State legislation the parents have to pay for the education, transport, etc., of a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a school for handicapped children when that <span class="highlight">child</span> is over 16 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the greatest problem troubling the parents of handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is always the thought in their minds: What is going to happen to our <span class="highlight">child</span> when we are no longer here? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The deficiency of this Bill, as I see it, is that the benefits are restricted to capital assistance for the training - and training alone - of various types of handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> is defined in the Bill as a person suffering from a physical or mental disability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will organisations which look after severely mentally retarded children benefit from this legislation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the position in regard to mongoloid children who are incapable of receiving vocational and educational training? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are organisations which took after these severely handicapped children to be denied the benefits of this Bill? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of those deficiencies which 1 think is applicable lo handicapped children is too restrictive an interpretation at the administrative level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Approved nursing homes, including nursing homes which look after handicapped children, are paid $2 a day in respect of each patient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an additional SUPplementary benefit of $3 a day paid where ti.e <span class="highlight">child</span> receives what is known as intensive care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had a case relating to this from the Intellectually and Physically Handicapped Childrens Association of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mongoloid children, particularly the severely affected mongoloid <span class="highlight">child</span>, not only need to be looked after on a custodial basis but also to be cared for with a lot more patience and a good deal more tolerance than. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the <span class="highlight">child</span> who is physically handicapped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been held administratively that, unless a <span class="highlight">child</span> is ill - physically ill - it is denied the benefit of $3 per day on the basis that it is not receiving intensive care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Association is the only association in New South Wales which looks after and cares for the multiple hand:capped <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the <span class="highlight">child</span> who is both crippled and mentally retarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps 1 should refer to the worst affected metally and physically retarded children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Association started these centres in 1962 to cater for these types of affected children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the Amour Park centre is to look after the <span class="highlight">child</span> who is not capable of being educated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To cater for the <span class="highlight">child</span> who is capable of being educated, the Intellectually and Physically Handicapped Children’s Associationon of New South Wales started in 1964 to erect a building - this is now known as the Hoxton Park Centre - at a cost of $52,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That school for physically and mentally retarded children at the present time has an enrolment of 91. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allow me to point out some of the costs which have been borne by this Association and by the parents of these children at the Amour Park Centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost per <span class="highlight">child</span> is S50 per week to which at the present, time the Commonwealth contributes the ordinary’ benefit, as it is called through the Commonwealth Department of Health of S2 per day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provided a <span class="highlight">child</span> is entitled to receive a supplementary benefit-this has been given a very restrictive application at the administrative level - a further $3 per day is paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That leaves $15 per day for the parents of each <span class="highlight">child</span> to find, lt is in this regard that 1 feel the Bill falls down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill covers only the training of the <span class="highlight">child</span> and the cost of cap’ lal improvements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he not think that the stage has been reached when we must consider not only the <span class="highlight">child</span> but also the parents? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that consideration should be given to paying to (he parents of these severely mentally retarded and physically handicapped children some type of financial assistance simitar to the invalid pension, lt should be a figure which is capable of assist-ng the parents in the every day running costs of keeping such a <span class="highlight">child</span> at a home such as those that I have mentioned and assisting them also to meet the incidental costs that crop up but about which nobody knows. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that the parents of these children are bearing a big enough burden, lt is a mental burden to them when a <span class="highlight">child</span> is born to them who, unfortunately, is physically or mentally retarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I request the Minister to give consideration to this proposal when the Budget is under consideration and to see whether or not some assistance could be given to parents of these children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general terms, training which is designed to teach a <span class="highlight">child</span> the activities of daily living, or which is of a social, remedial, pre-vocational, or vocational nature, will be accepted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is always difficult to say, if a <span class="highlight">child</span> is deaf or blind: Where is the dividing line? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a <span class="highlight">child</span> is mentally retarded it is difficult to say: Where is the dividing line in this case? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not always easy to decide, but if facilities are available the <span class="highlight">child</span> who needs those facilities will be brought into them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances I do not think we will ever know accurately the numbers of people who need help until we have facilities available and until there is in these facilities a place for every <span class="highlight">child</span> that needs help and can benefit by them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bui when you come to the <span class="highlight">child</span>, generally speaking this is the province of the State, particularly since it is not always easy lo distinguish between the education of the partially retarded arid the education of the normal <span class="highlight">child</span>, and education in the States is and remains a State matter at primary and secondary levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>this and because <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare is something which requires more individual application than the granting of the adult invalid pension it is reasonable to consider that this is primarily a State function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in this area we have already done one th n. We have provided the $1.50 a day subsidy for the maintenance of children in residential institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This we do because it is not normally the function of the Stale to provide boarding facilities for children, although it is normally the function of the State to provide day education for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is common ground with everyone who has investigated the problem of poverty that probably the best way to reduce poverty would be by an increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and we could, at no cost to the Treasury, nearly double the present level of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment by eliminating the income tax deduction for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This would of course make the assistance equal for everyone and eliminate the situation where the assistance - the sum of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and income tax deduction - for a first <span class="highlight">child</span>, for instance, is $1.29 for a man on a taxable income of $2,000 a year and $3.17- nearly 3 times as much - for a man on $20,000 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, there is also the question of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment which has not been increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of them is by an increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and another, of course, is an increase in the allowable deductions for wife and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The allowance of $208 for a <span class="highlight">child</span> is a confidence trick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A man who pays 50c in the $1 would get back through his income tax deduction a <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment benefit of $104 compared with the poorer man’s benefit of $2.08. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sir Arthur  Fadden once admitted to me that if we abolished income tax deductions for children altogether we could double <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So while the wage has increased by  39  per cent over that period the tax burden has increased as follows: For a single man by  79  per cent; for a married man by  94  per cent; for a married man with  1  <span class="highlight">child</span> by  105  per cent; for a married man with  2  children  114  per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These remain at  $312  for his spouse, parent,  parent-in-law,  or daughter-housekeeper;  $208  for his first <span class="highlight">child</span>, invalid relative or student <span class="highlight">child</span>; and  $1.56  for each other <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us take units of 3 people: A class A widow with 2 children under 16 years of age receives $27 per week; an invalid pensioner with a wife and a <span class="highlight">child</span> receives $24.50 per week; and a person receiving sickness benefit who has a wife and <span class="highlight">child</span> receives $19,50 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, the rate for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> has remained unaltered for 18 years; the rate for the second <span class="highlight">child</span> has remained unaltered for 20 years and the rate for the third <span class="highlight">child</span> for 4 years In 1949 a couple with 3 children received endowment amounting to 11.5 per cent of average male earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Alternatively, increases could have been made for the support of families through <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and maternity allowances, things that the Government has forgotten about years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us examine where the children of Australia stand in relation to this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to statistics, about 3,177,000 children are supported by the taxpayers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We can add to that the 85,000 children of the aged, invalids and widows and reach a total of just over 3) million. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a very alarming social equation, because 658,000 are the children of persons in the over $5,000 a year income group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, 2,604,000 children are to be disadvantaged by this Budget As a result of this Budget 80 per cent of the children will be worse off; 20 per cent will gain because their parents will gain from the tax reduction so cunningly contrived in its incidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us look at what this means for a widow with 3 children who will be receiving $34 a week including supplementary allowance and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can assume that she would be paying at least $10 a week in rent - and she would be lucky to obtain accommodation at that rate - and that food for herself and her children would cost her at least $12.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not taking into calculation the cost of clothing, transport, kiddies school books and all the extra fees that are imposed upon children by our State school system which is allegedly a free school system but which has become intolerably expensive for too many people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This system is too expensive not only for people in the poverty area but also for people on middle incomes and even people’ on average weekly earnings who have large families and who are confronted by the cost of books, uniforms and fees for sport and for the various other services associated with the facilities that are offered at the schools the children attend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me illustrate: A man with a wife and 2 children will receive $24.50 including <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment when he seeks sickness or unemployment benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even with the long term benefits the male head of a family with a wife and 2 children receives only $1 a week more than his wife would receive if she was widowed and was supporting the same number of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe in those days it was  Mrs Blackburn  -  also referred to endowment of the first <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me refer now to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and the maternity allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For 20 years there has been no increase in the rate of endowment paid for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> despite spiralling inflation in that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government does little or nothing adequately to encourage families in the lower income bracket to bring children into the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet this Government pays an insignificant 50c a week towards the cost of rearing the first <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a <span class="highlight">child</span> gets older the cost of keeping it increases, particularly the cost of clothing, footwear and education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely irrefutable evidence such as this must convince the Government that the initial step in seeking to improve the birth rate is to increase <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and the maternity allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It stands condemned for its failure to increase <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, for its failure to classify the class B widow in the same category as the single age or invalid pensioner, for its failure to increase the maternity allowance and for its failure to adjust pensioner funeral benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I strongly support the raising .of the amount of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the raising of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment firstly because it has not been raised for a long while and secondly because it would appear to be the one area foi which substantial help could be given to the man in the lower income group who has a large family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment is a practical, worthwhile and effective way of doing something for him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to draw the attention of the House to the inescapable fact that any increase in pensions and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment can give only temporary relief while there is a continual rise in the cost of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same argument applies to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Page 61 of the same report shows that in 1969 the number of endowed children was 1,050,357. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amount, spent on <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment increased from $57.4m in 1949 to $184m in 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More is being spent on <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment but less is being received in purchasing power by the endowed children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1949 a man with a wife and 2 children on the minimum wage paid $1.60 a year in income tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1949 <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment paid to a family of 3 children represented an amount of 11.3 per cent of the average male earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A man, his wife and 3 children is close to the size of the average family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The family with 3 children now gets  S3  <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment represents less than 5 per cent of the average male earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A comparison with the minimum wage also shows how the value of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment has dropped over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1948 with a minimum wage of $11.60 a family of 5 children received $4 a week in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To retain the same relationship the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment should now be over $12 for a family of 5. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was no increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to make up for loss of purchasing power through inflation over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, from the inception of maternityallowances in 1912 until this Government came into office the allowance would always pay the expenses associated with the birth of a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently married couples are putting off having children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both husband and wife have to go to work in most cases to get their home together before having children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It extends federal sharing to include the following costs, which were not shared under the Unemployment Assistance Act: The cost of assistance to needy mothers with dependent children, maintenance of children in the care of provincially approved <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare agencies, health care services to needy persons, and the extension of welfare services to prevent or remove causes of  dependency or to assist recipients in achieving self-support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not the fault of the <span class="highlight">child</span>; it is not the fault of the parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When comparing pensions we might also compare <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the campaign preceding the elections of 1949 the Liberal and Country Party promised, if elected, to grant <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment in respect of the first <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But since 1949 we have not seen the rate of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment increase to any great extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been increased marginally but the purchasing power of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment today cannot compare with its purchasing power in 1949. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under certain conditions, such as if she has a <span class="highlight">child</span> in her care, she is entitled only to a wife’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One aspect with which I wish to deal specifically is the Government’s refusal to give any worthwhile assistance to the family within the framework of social  services  <span class="highlight">Child</span> endowment is one of the best ways in which to assist the family because it is paid irrespective of the income earned by that family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment was introduced in 1941 it was 50c for each <span class="highlight">child</span> after the first <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1941 a man with a wife and 3 children received <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment of $1 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That same couple with 3 children today would receive S3 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment has only increased from Si to $3. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the basis of no <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for the second and third children, a person with 3 children should receive $4 a week today if (he rate had been kept up to a commensurate sum, plus further <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for the first <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government apparently thinks that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and the family today are old hat, and yet the family is the very basis of our community and these are the people whom we should be looking after. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be an increase of at least $1 a week for the second and third children plus a further increase to take account of the first <span class="highlight">child</span> if <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment is to be commensurate to when it was first introduced in this Parliament in 1941. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a returned soldier with full cognisance of the position, 1 cannot see why a war widow  with 3 children should receive $39.50 a week whilst a civilian widow with 3 children receives only $29 a week, and an extra $2 if 1 of the children is under the age of 6 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, a war widow receives $10.50 a week more than a civilian widow, unless the latter has a <span class="highlight">child</span> under the age of 6 years, in which case the difference is $8.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both have lost their husbands, breadwinners or partners in helping them to bring up the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a woman desires to stay at home with her children and help to bring them up, she should be able to do so; she should not be forced to go to work because of the inadequacy of the pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Government contribution for a single <span class="highlight">child</span> is $30. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is best to have 1 <span class="highlight">child</span> at a time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say again to the Minister that it is high time something was done for the deserted fathers and for married couples who have more than one <span class="highlight">child</span> at a time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was rather intrigued to hear from such an eligible young bachelor the concern which he expressed about <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and the maternity allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are mindful of the fact, for instance, that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, maternity allowances, <span class="highlight">child</span> allowances, wife’s allowances and certain other benefits are very important and necessary for the welfare and reasonable living standard of a large number of families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those people should have received consideration from the Government by way of increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and certain other allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite that, the Government has refused to make any adjustment to social service items such as wife’s allowances, <span class="highlight">child</span> allowances, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and other benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even where the latter couple have a <span class="highlight">child</span> to keep the pension will still be only $25 a week, or $2.50 less than the amount received by other pensioner couples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely if the Government honestly believes that $27.50 is adequate for a pensioner couple it should be prepared to pay the same amount at least to a couple with a <span class="highlight">child</span> and where only one is a pensioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is the Government’s argument, it is pretty heartless, particularly in the case of a couple with a <span class="highlight">child</span>, because surely in those circumstances the mother’s place is in the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is prepared to make only the miserable increase of SOc in the pension of the widow and has refused to make any adjustment to the mother’s allowance and the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us balance these things out and put them in the right perspective, lt is a very peculiar state of affairs for anyone to state that a widow and a <span class="highlight">child</span> of a man who loses his life in the service of his country are not entitled to what we are giving them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Guardian’s allowance: An allowance of  $4  per week is paid to single and widowed pensioners where there is a <span class="highlight">child</span> under  16  or a student <span class="highlight">child</span> between  16  and  21. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where the <span class="highlight">child</span> is under  6  years of age, or an invalid, this is increased to  $6  per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The widespread defects of the State systems of education are so grave and apparent that not one Liberal Minister in 1969 allowed any of his children to attend a State secondary school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These architects of generous direct aid to independent schools all ensured that their children of secondary school age attended an independent secondary school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is specially damnable about the Conservatives’ practice of excluding State schools from the direct assistance provided for independent schools is that this policy widens even further the great gap which exists between the opportunities which can be provided for a <span class="highlight">child</span> attending State schools and those excellent opportunities provided for children attending independent non-Catholic schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The contribution to teacher education, preschool education, the <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education programme, student assistance by means of the expanded Commonwealth Scholarships schemes - we have already mentioned that this afternoon - and assistance for Aboriginal students are examples of this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would say that at the present moment nearly every <span class="highlight">child</span> in Brunswick and Coburg is not as well served in education as were the children attending those schools in 1938. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to my mind this will be like a newly born <span class="highlight">child</span>: If you do not allow it to toddle it will never learn to walk and if you do not teach it to walk it will never be able to run. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These children are, apart from their disability, otherwise normal having average or above average intelligence; but due to difficulties particularly associated with reading and writing the condition manifests itself firstly by the <span class="highlight">child</span> failing to keep up with his classmates in his work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the first few years the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s work indeed becomes impaired in all subjects because no subject can be handled if a <span class="highlight">child</span> is unable to read properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such teaching can result, therefore, in a dramatic improvement in relation to the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s performance not only at his school work but in his personality and behaviour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Essential needs for these children are adequate facilities for diagnosis, for training of remedial teachers and for other equipment for teaching purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a recent precedent for this in that the Commonwealth Government has recently intervened in educating the <span class="highlight">child</span> in another field of learning disability, that of those who cannot cope with the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here the Commonwealth has undertaken to finance the training of teachers of migrant children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that the Government will consider the provision of funds for capital works for these children with specific learning disabilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With regard to subnormals, for instance, there was a time when it was believed that there were only certain groups - the imbecile level and the moron level if you like, the higher grade, and the medium grade defective children who could in any sense be trained or educated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But through the work that has been carried out at the Newcastle institution it is now realised that short of the actual vegetable - the <span class="highlight">child</span> who is practically completely helpless and who has a mental age of 6 months or less - these people can be helped by a more positive and productive approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While a <span class="highlight">child</span> in an English speaking country is struggling agonisingly through his first year at school with sentences like the cat sat on the rag mat’, the Italian or Mexican <span class="highlight">child</span> is reading fascinating stories that appeal to children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The sooner we start assisting handicapped children the better because very often something can be done for a <span class="highlight">child</span> if that <span class="highlight">child</span> is treated at an early age and helped when it is young. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The capacity to help a <span class="highlight">child</span> is lost if its treatment does not start until later in life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most dramatic case of this is the totally deaf <span class="highlight">child</span> who can be helped to what is normal intelligence if it can be given by specialist training early in life, the power of conceptualisation and symbolisation through some medium other than the hearing that it has lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If such a <span class="highlight">child</span> does not receive this training early in life its intelligence, as I think the honourable member for Kingston implied, can be impaired permanently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The younger a <span class="highlight">child</span> is treated the better because the better is that <span class="highlight">child</span> able to be helped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What sort of a life is it for a family with young children to live in a flat in a building of possibly 2 or 3 storeys? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Wrong, in the personal sense, because age of arrival in Australia can determine whether a <span class="highlight">child</span> will have a chance, or be a no-hoper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only voice of realism that I have heard from the Government side on this matter has been that of the Minister for Customs and Excise  (Mr Chipp)  who was given this rather unwelcome foster <span class="highlight">child</span> of the Treasurer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This answer, which is in yesterday’s Hansard for those who are interested, shows that in 1969-70 <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment was 0.73 per cent of the gross national expenditure whereas in 1960-61, 9 years earlier, it was 0.98 per cent of the gross national expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another interesting point is that relative to the total number there was an increase in the proportion of children receiving <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment in 1 969-70 compared to 1960-61. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This shows the deterioration that has taken place in the real value of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As an example let us take 2 families each with 3 children under the age of 16 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Each family receives $3 per week in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment irrespective of the income of the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite a feasible proposition that most of the taxpayers of Australia and most families would be better off if the Government did away with the taxation concessions for children and doubled the amount of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment which was payable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I could never understand why the wife and <span class="highlight">child</span>, say, of one taxpayer should attract a much higher, or, if you look at it another way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further, 80 per cent of the  3i  million children in Australia who are supported by the wage and salary earners are losers because they are maintained by the group with net taxable incomes of less than $5,000 per year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>And what is even worse is that this Government in its paltriness has not increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> since 1949. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What has actually happened is that there is now the school for Aboriginals on the old mission site and another shcool for European children at the township, 7 miles away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I turn now to the subject of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there is one group in this community that is suffering at poverty level this group is in that area to which <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment is paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To alleviate this poverty, will he take steps immediately towards an increase of existing <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment rates to $3 per week for the third <span class="highlight">child</span> and to $4 per week for the fourth <span class="highlight">child</span> and subsequent children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us consider the question of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment on the statistics available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Minister wishes to apply to that amount the indices that he used in his second reading speech in dealing wilh the subject of social services, that amount should now be $1.13 a <span class="highlight">child</span> per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Literally thousands of Australian people who happen to be Aboriginals are living in huts or shanties, and it is impossible for the children in these places to carry on with ordinary school work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 3,000 or 4,000 Aboriginal children are only a handful of those children at this level of education, and there are 3 million or 4 million people in a wealthy community who support such a programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He will remember that a year ago I undertook that a Labor government would ensure that every <span class="highlight">child</span> would have the opportunity of 1 year’s preschool education, as every <span class="highlight">child</span> in Canberra already has, and he will also remember that his predecessor promptly produced an estimate that such facilities would entail $160m capital cost and an annual recurrent cost rising to $32m, excluding the cost of training additional pre-school teachers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can he bring up to date the estimates of Professor Ronald Henderson presented at the Australian Institute of Political Science Summer School on Poverty in Australia at Canberra on 25th to27th January 1969 in a paper entitled The Dimension of Poverty in Australia for (a) substantially increasing <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments and having them treated as taxable income and (b) the elimination of tax concessions for children and the provision of this money for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As 1 understand the situation, at least one shire has already expanded its services to include the provision of <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-37-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the 1963 elections we promised to give secondary scholarships to every <span class="highlight">child</span> for the last 2 years of senior school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would not be interested if we had only scarce number of scholarships available in giving them to parents who could afford to buy extra tuition for their sons and daughters who could afford to get the best textbooks and reference books and to take their children on travels and to provide them with all the things to give extra advantage to those who are already advantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have said that we will give scholarships to every secondary school <span class="highlight">child</span> in the last 2 years of school and we will make places in universities free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do point out that this country is very often compared with countries whose figures include such items as the following in their educational expenses: school meals, free milk, the nation’s cultural activities, scientific research, sport, youth activities, <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare, armed services colleges, radio and television and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a system which has encouraged the streaming of children in the sense of what might be called their aptitudes or their intelligence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can be contradicted in this, but it appears that if a <span class="highlight">child</span> is classified too early - say at first form at the age of 12 or 13  -  as being only of pass level, research shows that this <span class="highlight">child</span> is not motivated any more to try very hard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been proved that when a <span class="highlight">child</span> has been classified as not being of the highest grade he thinks there is no need for him to make the application that others are making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is particularly so when a <span class="highlight">child</span> is at a school with other children who are undertaking studies at a higher level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teachers, of course, are aware of the different intelligence levels of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been shown that by streaming children into what are deemed to be the brighter, the less bright and the dull, the bright certainly improve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the concurrence of honourable members 1 incorporate in Hansard a table headed ‘Achievement Quotients of Children in Different Streams at Various Stages of Schooling’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over a 2-year period the bright youngster between the ages of 8 and 10 years improved and the middle-of-the-road <span class="highlight">child</span> did not show any change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the <span class="highlight">child</span> who was not making the same progress as the <span class="highlight">child</span> at the highest level in fact dropped back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Cross  indicates that it is obviously not a good thing to stream or classify children too early because the one who is not so bright gets worse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We suggest this because it seems to us that there is an extra burden on families in nonmetropolitan areas who send their children away to a tertiary institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that the percentage of income spent on sending a <span class="highlight">child</span> to university is higher than it is for a city family on the same income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the things that he has said and done in this House and been responsible for, such as, as the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  said, the Japanese Trade Agreement which has had an effect on the lives of every man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> in this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The importance of education in the English language to the migrant - adult and <span class="highlight">child</span> - has been stressed by responsible authorities and migrant organisations ever since the commencement of the scheme, and particularly in more recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is difficult for a teacher to transmit knowledge to a <span class="highlight">child</span> who has very little, if any, understanding of the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is just as unfair to the children who, in many cases, while mentally more advanced that those who know and understand English are forced to languish in lower classes because of this disability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, there are children to be considered and, secondly, adults. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A few moments ago 1 quoted from a statement by Carolyn Dowling about migrant children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gives the <span class="highlight">child</span> the opportunity in the right atmosphere to learn the means of communication and fulfil his educational desires according to his capacity as times goes on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is fair to ask the Minister how long it is expected that the classes will function until the <span class="highlight">child</span> is competent in English. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, what will be the ages of the children who will attend these classes It is more essential than ever that some form of teaching be introduced to the school when it is considered that the New South Wales survey on this problem revealed that about 47 per cent of the children come from homes where no English is spoken lt is probably true to say that this form of planning, when expanded, must prove of benefit to the <span class="highlight">child</span>, and particularly to the harassed teacher who is endeavouring to transmit knowledge to a percentage of the class who simply do not know what is being said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an endeavour to offer a constructive approach to improving the education of adult and <span class="highlight">child</span> migrants and to relieving the States of some of the responsibility for a national programme of immigration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I offer this amendment as a constructive approach to improve the <span class="highlight">child</span> and adult education of migrants brought to Australia in a scheme commenced 25 years ago which has always had the sympathy and support of honourable members on all sides of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are the question of educating migrant children, the question of the extension and improvement of adult education in one or more parts of the world, and the question of an intensive language course for migrants better versed in some skill or other who possibly are already acquainted with the rudiments of the English language and are better able to comprehend an intensive course than are others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there would appear to be immediately a prima facie case for very considerable <span class="highlight">child</span> education in the English language for migrant children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of these children, of course, have come from homes and continue to come from homes where English is rarely if ever spoken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She said that in New South Wales 32 per cent of migrant children - almost 1 in 3 - in the total school population have language problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Se pointed out that mildly intellectually handicapped children number some 30,000 but the next category of special needs in this country so far as education is concerned involves the 16,452 migrant children in New South Wales and a similar proportion of the school population in other States who have language problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My colleague the honourable member for Grayndler has mentioned how the circumstances of a migrant <span class="highlight">child</span> affect him in his English speaking ability at school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this underlines the importance of ensuring that migrant children and their parents are given the greatest possible encouragement to learn the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The development of the <span class="highlight">child</span> migration education programme in particular was a new Commonwealth interest involving considerable expenditure of Commonwealth funds and therefore was most properly a matter which ought to be in the form of a Bill to come before the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the biggest difficulties which teachers at the Dandenong technical school experienced was communicating with the parents of these migrant children, both from the simplest level of understanding why a <span class="highlight">child</span> was absent from school to the matter of giving educational or vocational advice or counselling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>230 are children of migrant parents, and of those 230 students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking generally, the teachers at this school said that children of migrant parents measure up quite well academically with the Australian born <span class="highlight">child</span>, but that many find their task made much harder by their struggle with English, particularly in some cases because of the habit, or insistence, of parents in speaking their native tongue in the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This imposes quite a handicap on these children as they have to cope with 2 languages - English at school and their native tongue at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mainly they are the southern European children who are having the most difficulty with English at this school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of a total enrolment of 450, approximately 130 are children of migrant parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The migrant children at this school do not encounter difficulties with English to any marked degree, although naturally there are exceptions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those of Italian extraction” generally seem to have more difficulty than the other migrant children.I have referred to secondary schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 want to refer quickly to a few statistics regarding primary schools because these schools, in the main, encounter greater difficulties with migrant children speaking the English language than do the secondary schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In practically all of the schools that I have mentioned one of the most pressing problems with non-English speaking migrant children is that there is a complete lack of contact with their parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children returning home from school have to communicate in their native tongue and this imposes great stress on a young <span class="highlight">child</span> who has to cope with 2 languages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the non-English speaking migrant children are at a distinct disadvantage with their parents conversing only in their native tongues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From my observations many Greeks, Italians, Yugoslavs and Turks are in need of intensive courses in English because, in the main, their children have to cope with 2 languages as little English is spoken in the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the greatest difficulties is to communicate with the parents from the simple level of understanding why the <span class="highlight">child</span> was absent from school to the matter of giving educational and vocational advice or counselling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to understand and meet the needs of migrant children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the case anyway when a migrant <span class="highlight">child</span> arrives here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to understand that the home of a migrant <span class="highlight">child</span> is different in many significant respects from that of his fellow students or teachers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think it is necessary for me to go into the general argument as to the special tensions which arise in migrant homes between the parents and the children because of 2 different sets of values, 2 languages, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is an error to assume that all migrant children wanted to come here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we are talking about citizenship education in the context of migrant education one of the points that should be considered at least is the question of instructing Australian children in the same schools and certainly in schools in areas where a large proportion of the migrant children come from one country, be it Italy, Greece or Turkey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian children in these schools should be instructed in the culture and history of the country from which the migrant children have come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This should have a twofold effect  -  I hope it would have thai effect.. On the one hand it would make it possible for Australian kids to understand some of the attitudes of the other children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly - and I think that this is probably just as important - it would make the migrant <span class="highlight">child</span> feel reason ably proud of his origin; it would not make him feel that he had a non-existent background. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to the question of establishing the abilities of children early in life-. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this sorting out process is wrong even from the point of view of the Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> but certainly it is very wrong from the point of view of the migrant <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is wrong to sort the migrant <span class="highlight">child</span> into some stream which will determine his or her later educational expectation on the basis of some test which is given soon after the arrival of that <span class="highlight">child</span> in this country.IQ tests, aptitude tests and so on will give completely wrong readings in the case of the <span class="highlight">child</span> who has arrived in Australia only recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position of this <span class="highlight">child</span> is completely different from that of an Australian <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two points of difference to be considered are the language barrier and the whole cultural background of the immigrant <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, it is extremely difficult for the migrant <span class="highlight">child</span> to obtain adequate marks in the first test of this type that he or she faces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Department of Immigration will strive to discourage State education departments from screening children with a migrant background too soon after their arrival in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like other speakers, I find that migrant children suffer a serious disability in some of the schools in my electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those schools in the inner suburbs and in the older established areas there is a very high percentage of migrant children in all the classes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in at least one school in my electorate and in at least one class in this school every <span class="highlight">child</span> is a migrant and none of them has a proper command of the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that 5 per cent of the school population are migrant children, but of course this percentage must be very much higher in many of the schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The influx into schools of migrant children with a language disability in English has created great problems not only for the children but also for the schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although these children will gradually pick up meaningful words and phrases they are at a grave disadvantage in following normal lessons given in English. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides for an adult programme, a <span class="highlight">child</span> education programme and an intensive course programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the main these would be children who are immediately put into the school system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the annual prize-giving at any primary school it will be found that the <span class="highlight">child</span>, who may be termed a new settler, of parents who obviously cannot speak English is at a disadvantage because he certainly never scores prizes in English. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Often he is regarded as being in the slow learner class, not because of any intellectual disability but because he is unable to keep up with the other children, particularly if he is at the age of  8, 9  or  10  years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are the primary school children whom I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the secondary school <span class="highlight">child</span> who has even more difficulties because he comes into a higher category of education, where there is far more competition, with a basic defect of not being able to understand the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He says that if we were to apply the same methods to children in primary or secondary schools we could get a rapid result with those children who may be somewhat vague as to what a person is trying to tell them in English or when asked to repeat by rote some English word. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This opportunity should be available to every <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Full-scale production of material designed specifically for <span class="highlight">child</span> migrants will possibly take 2 to 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My <span class="highlight">child</span> al school has not gol on at all or is not making any progress because he or she is unhappy or because he or she cannot understand the teacher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We understand the education system and our children at least will have the same opportunity as any other <span class="highlight">child</span> and nol be put in a secondary position where there is no opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would ensure that the migrant <span class="highlight">child</span> at school was not a dropout and had an opportunity to compete with other children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, the migrant <span class="highlight">child</span> of school age quite obviously is at a very distinct disadvantage on arrival in Australia and any new facilities that will give that <span class="highlight">child</span> a better chance to proceed at a normal rate in the early periods of its education after arrival here will be welcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The migrant <span class="highlight">child</span> of secondary school age has an almost impossible task because that <span class="highlight">child</span> lacks the cultural and historical background to cope with our education system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As that <span class="highlight">child</span> has not passed through our primary school system he or she is in a very serious situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A <span class="highlight">child</span> which gets to primary school without a basic knowledge of English and without a fairly good understanding ot our culture does not obtain a Commonwealth scholarship later in life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>It could be very effective at the pre-school level if English training of a primary nature could be given to children,  f  well remember the case of a young German <span class="highlight">child</span> who lived near us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until he went to kindergarten where practically all children spoke English, his English language, to say the least, was somewhat mixed up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In areas where there are large concentrations of migrants - there are areas where  70  per cent,  80  per cent and up to  90  per cent of the population are migrants - the ability to mix or the value of mixing with children who talk English does not exist, and therefore the migrant children are severely handicapped when they begin school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In February 1960 a special committee of the Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Council submitted a report on the progress and assimilation of migrant children in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This involved a study of both pre-school children and children in primary and secondary schools, a survey of schools in which migrant children were enrolled and consultation with their teachers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In late 1967 and early 1968 the Department initiated the planning of a major survey of the educational needs of both adult and <span class="highlight">child</span> migrants, and this led to the report on the situation of migrant children in schools in New South Wales which has provided such an important basis for the new initiatives for <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The rate at which the <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education programme has developed since it was announced in April of last year has in fact exceeded expectations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the conditions under which the <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education programme operates is that preferably the special teachers should be additional to the normal teaching establishments so that the drain on normal teaching establishments will be avoided and, in the main, this has certainly been the pattern of developments to date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With all these films and books that we have been talking about, parents have never lived in a. more difficult age in trying to bring up a family because of all the temptations that are thrown at children when they leave school and often while they are at school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is hard enough to rear children today with the present form of censorship without having it removed altogether. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Literate people expect everybody else to be equally literate and understanding and some corrupt deliberately, as happened in the case that I referred to of the university publication which was sent to me by a parent who picked it up from his secondary school <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710223_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally enough I have a lot of sympathy for this point of view but I would point out, as other honourable members have pointed out, that children cannot logically be considered to have this capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710223_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we accept this proposition it may be argued that it is the responsibility of the parent to direct or guide what his <span class="highlight">child</span> shall see, hear or read or how the <span class="highlight">child</span> will act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710223_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Firstly, for a goodly proportion of his waking hours after he has reached school age, the <span class="highlight">child</span> is largely outside the direct control of the parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710223_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a section of that society has standards of a nature considered grossly undesirable by the rest of society, without some form of censorship the <span class="highlight">child</span> can unwittingly be exposed to unwelcome material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710223_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most parents impose standards for their children - standards of action and standards relating to the material which they can see, read or hear - and I believe most parents would like their elected represen-tatives to help them to maintain these community standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710223_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will prevent by law ‘children under the age of 18 from seeing material which in my view they should not see - material which the Film Censorship Board spends great lengths of time viewing and discussing from the point of view of its possible effects on impressionable children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710223_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other matter 1 wish to deal with concerns a letter which I directed to the Minister for Social Services pointing out that the Act made no provision, as to sickness and unemployment benefits, for a fellow who was unfortunate enough to suffer an accident in his home - a private accident if I may use that term - and who had a <span class="highlight">child</span> over 16 receiving education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710223_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I want to do in the remainder of the time allotted to me is to condemn the Government for being so lacking in proper understanding and for not recognising that there is no provision for children over 16 receiving education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710223_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Members were discussing election policy items and 1 had brought to the notice of Caucus an anomaly in the social welfare regulations in that aged widow and widower pensioners who had either a <span class="highlight">child</span> or children living at home caring for their parent were being refused the Postmaster-General’s Department’s fringe benefits in those cases where the <span class="highlight">child</span> was earning in excess of the permissible supplementary income a pensioner was allowed to have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710224_reps_27_hor71/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be thought that the  non-payment of a benefit for one <span class="highlight">child</span> for a few weeks would not mean much of a loss to a family if sickness is not retcurring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710224_reps_27_hor71/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>but with the extension of the school leaving age it is not impossible for two or more children over 16 years of age in one family to be receiving full-time education, yet if sickness overtakes that family such students are not taken into account in determining the amount of benefit the family should receive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710224_reps_27_hor71/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They eat as much as adults and it costs as much to clothe them as adults, but they are not recognised as dependants and this imposes a double penalty on the family because in calculating the amount of benefit payable in respect of children, those children’ above .16 years of age are not considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710224_reps_27_hor71/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Taking the average weekly earnings as a basis and applying <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for  3  children as a percentage of average weekly earnings one finds that in  1950  a mother with  3  children received <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment of  12.9  per cent of average weekly earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here again if the Government and the Minister are dinkum in their claim of improving social services above the 1949 situation, they should immediately increase the <span class="highlight">child</span> allowance by at least$1 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>First, it can apply  a  tremendous loading on to  a  property left by a deceased person, perhaps to 1 <span class="highlight">child</span>, if the beneficiary is going to continue to have the benefit of his knowledge of that farm  - a  far greater knowledge than anyone else would have - and to carry on with the working of the farm as  a  viable operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth originally set up the Lady Gowrie <span class="highlight">child</span> centres on very generous lines - generous, at any rate, for the days when they were set up - and the theory was to say to the States: ‘Well, there they are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the importance of pre-school education if of comparatively recent recognition insofar as it does condition a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s future attitudes and those foundations that he acquires in his early years, particularly between the ages of  3  years and 5 years, which are so important <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today it is being said that the crucial educational years are the first 5 years of life and that if certain learning does not take place during this period, the <span class="highlight">child</span> may never fully make up the loss. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without labouring the point, it is important to remember that pre-school education is, above all, laying these firm foundations for the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s subsequent educational experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It found that some 50 per cent of those children had received at least 1 year of pre-school education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If pre-school education is recognised as being as important as it is then every effort should be made to provide adequate facilities so that every <span class="highlight">child</span> has at least the opportunity, which its parents may or may not take up, to have that important educational experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, it revealed that 14,000 children attended 555 registered full time day centres in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister said that this was consistent with the statistician’s findings that 18,500 children were in parttime or full-time centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet only 7 per cent of these children were in <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>lt often costs more in New South Wales to send a <span class="highlight">child</span> to kindergarten than it does to send a student to university. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Many of these kindergartens are little more than <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres with hardly any educational content. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How can a woman with, say, 2 children find the incentive to go to work if she has to pay $20 a week for the care of her children at a pre-school education centre? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless in many areas there are long waiting lists and many parents have to book children into various types of centres months and even years ahead if they want to get them accommodated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What has happened to the announcement made by the Government in February last year that the Commonwealth would set up a network of <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres throughout Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will they be <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres or centres properly oriented to education? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, according to the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Lynch),  only 2 registered full day <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres have been provided by employers in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It probably costs a minimum of $30,000 or $40,000 to set up a centre for some 25 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a change in emphasis from the social development of a <span class="highlight">child</span> in kindergartens and pre-school centres to the intellectual development of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the development of the concept that disadvantaged children should receive compensatory pre-school training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I mentioned earlier the United Kingdom is giving effect to the Plowden report that pre-school training should be available to all children over 3 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by saying that the Opposition stands for this: For Government responsibility for education, including the obligation to ensure that pre-school education is available for every <span class="highlight">child</span>; The Commonwealth to establish an Australian preschool commission to define and examine regularly the aims of pre-school education and to recommend grants which the Commonwealth should make to the States to ensure that pre-school centres are located, staffed and equipped on the basis of needs and priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does, of course, raise the major social issue of just where children aged between 3 and 5 years can best be trained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also well established - and probably increasingly so as time passes and educational psychology develops - that the mother is the central figure in a young <span class="highlight">child</span>’s life and if she has the capacity to transmit not only love and affection but also something of a basically intellectual kind, so much the better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the plain fact remains that not all mothers are, at least in any formal sense, capable of transmitting, much less trained to transmit, in any sort of defined area in any meaningful, efficient or educational sense, a body of information equivalent to the capacity of her <span class="highlight">child</span>, or for that matter somebody else’s <span class="highlight">child</span>, to absorb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question at large of social attitudes and social influences in this area can, of course, open up a whole gamut of possibilities between the wholesale creches of the Soviet Union and our hitherto held concept of a young <span class="highlight">child</span>’s place being in the home with the mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must admit to some degree of agreement with the honourable member for Denison  (Dr Solomon)  that on the question of a pre-school <span class="highlight">child</span> the home is probably the best training place, but with the qualification that the home is economically and domestically stable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These teachers may be used to staff creches which not only educate the children but care for them in other ways because there are special groups that require this help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another group is the deserted wives, widows and unmarried mothers, all of whom often have to find sources of employment to be able to provide for their children and keep the family together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At present in many cases they have to use the private <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres which, in the main, are expensive and do not have adequately trained personnel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A pre-school education must be regarded as a right of every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its value is paramount for a society which is concerned with the social, emotional, aesthetic and intellectual growth of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the environment of the pre-school the door is opened to a wider range of creative and imaginative activities than is provided in the homes and neighbourhoods of many children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pre-school provides both the outlet and the avenue for physical and intellectual growth which are essential to the healthy development of young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The foundations which the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s home provides for growth as a social individual and for the development of reasoning and communication skills are reinforced in an atmosphere which makes learning a happy and rewarding experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only about 3 per cent of the children of pre-school age in New South Wales are attending pre-schools, while the figure in Victoria is approximately 30 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By comparison the Commonwealth recognises the right of all children in the Australian Capital Territory to 1 year of pre-school education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus the chances of a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s educational opportunities are determined not in accordance with the principle of equality and the needs of the <span class="highlight">child</span> but with the fortuitous circumstance of where he. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The subsidy system means that a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s educational opportunities are determined not by his needs and not by the Government’s sense of responsibility, but by the accident of where he happens to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus we have the situation in Victoria referred to by the Maternal and <span class="highlight">Child</span> Welfare Officer of South Melbourne Council, Doctor Dora Bialestock, who was quoted in the ‘Age’ of 14th November last year as saying that the largest portion of the Victorian Government’s subsidy for preschools was going to the more affluent suburbs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She said that only 1 <span class="highlight">child</span> in 7 in the working class suburb of Brunswick and only 1 in 5 in South Melbourne were receiving a pre-school education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But even worse, the sheer materialism of she Commonwealth Government now threatens to build up a system of Commonwealth subsidised day care centres for children, which I believe will have little to do with the educational needs of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of such centres as exist at present ignore the personal, social and educational needs of children and are aimed principally at caring for children while mothers return to the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the existing <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres breed boredom, insecurity, poor intellectual development, sometimes poor health, frustration and conformity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only a Government which is concerned with profitability and productivity in the economy rather than the needs of children could finance the expansion of such a system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This materialism must be replaced by concern for the needs of children which will produce a system of pre-schools for all children, and which will help develop creative self-reliant responsible and cooperative individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least the Government should ensure that if it does intend to subsidise <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres or day care centres - or whatever other terminology the Government cares to use - it will balance and co-ordinate the principal economic needs that it is catering for with the educational needs of the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the Labor Party’s Pre-School Commission will aim not only to ensure equal access for all children to a preschool education but also to discriminate in favour of those who are disadvantaged by the limitations of home environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Children from low income families, migrant children, Aboriginal children and handicapped children are unlikely to be equal to others in the level of intellectual and social skills which they have achieved by the time they reach the primary school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The middle class Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> has already received from his home environment the advantage of greater opportunities for communication, for social confidence, for creativity, for reasoning of the type required by the primary school, and for motivation to be successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By comparison, the migrant or Aboriginal <span class="highlight">child</span> faces the massive obstacles of differences between his national and racial cultures and the culture of the white Australian school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The physically, mentally or socially handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> faces specific disadvantages which will severely retard his educational growth unless identified and treated early. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> from a family of low income, low education and low occupational status by comparison with the middle class Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> will not have reached the same level of development of his basic skills of language and reasoning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The disadvantages faced by all these groups of children will accentuate and accelerate throughout their school careers unless they are treated at an early stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first few years of education are critical to the attitude which a <span class="highlight">child</span> develops towards the school and to the abilities he acquires and develops. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential that every <span class="highlight">child</span> should be and feel successful, both at meeting the intellectual tasks set by the school and at being a self-confident individual and member of the school’s society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, while catering for the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s social and personal growth, the schools must strive to maximise every <span class="highlight">child</span>’s ability to communicate, to understand, to concentrate, to create and to find pleasure and satisfaction in learning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pre-school level is clearly a strategic stage for identifying and starting to remedy the deficiencies of the disadvantaged <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Pre-Schools Commission will treat the remedying of handicaps suffered by disadvantaged children as one of its principal tasks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The traditional rofe of the pre-schools, according to  Dr M.  M. de Lemos, writing in the ‘Quarterly Review of Australian Education’ of June 1968, has been seen as ‘providing mainly for the social and emotional development of the <span class="highlight">child</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The emphasis has been placed on creative and dramtatic play, and the schools’ task has been seen as educating the ‘whole <span class="highlight">child</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The teacher’s role is seen as responding to the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s needs rather than imposing guidance or instruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The value of this role in catering for largely middle class groups of children has been considerable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The handicaps which the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s cultural environment cause and in which the greatest retardation generally occurs are in the reasoning and language abilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems apparent, therefore, that the learning situation provided for the disadvantaged <span class="highlight">child</span> by the preschool must be structured specifically to develop those skills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what does seem clear is that specialised teaching is required in the skills in which the disadvantaged <span class="highlight">child</span> is deficient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The alternative is to treat him as though he were equal to the more advantaged middle class Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> and to keep the pre-school oriented towards the present combination of emotional and social development and self-directed learning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This alternative, however, would ignore the already substantial advantages of the middle class <span class="highlight">child</span> and is likely to leave the disadvantaged <span class="highlight">child</span> with the same relative handicaps with which he entered the pre-school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that pre-school education is a vital stage of a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It serves particularly a strategic role in remedying the disadvantages of certain groups of Australian children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the problem now can only be tackled by the Commonwealth Government and that Commonwealth assistance must be based according to the needs of children themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One should like firstly to deal with the question of the cost-price squeeze, a matter which is affecting every man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the 1970 Senate election campaign the Government announced as a new Commonwealth initiative, as the honourable gentleman has mentioned - the introduction of a scheme to assist in the introduction and operation of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres of approved standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did so, as I recall, against a background of concern that the care, development and welfare of children whose mothers worked should be safeguarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When his successor, the present Treasurer  (Mr Snedden),  at last was able to bring in such a Bill he had to accept responsibility for a much more puny <span class="highlight">child</span> than numerous progress bulletins had led members of this Parliament and the community to expect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So high was the rate of cross infection that, according to Sister Gilbertson, the cross infection rale resulted in a period that followed October 1969 in 116 children being cross infected with chickenpox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All of us here would be alarmed and disturbed if this were to happen to our own children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We would be alarmed if, when we sent a <span class="highlight">child</span> to hospital for a tonsilectomy operation, an enormous incidence of cross infection occured at that hospital and that <span class="highlight">child</span> became infected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regard that as being of great significance because, when a <span class="highlight">child</span> gets the advantage of education in the pre-school period, it is a thing that compounds as he goes through his education, and the longer he goes to school the greater the value he derives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although I agree that there is a necessity for colleges like the Yirara College and the Kormilda College, in which a very good job is done by devoted and capable people, I still believe that we should not be adopting this attitude in such a switch-throwing way - taking these children away from their mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters and their tribal background and sending them to Alice Springs and Darwin for education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said earlier, honourable members on both sides of the House have had quite numerous representations made to them recently by local governing authorities suggesting that payments should be made directly from the Commonwealth to the local authorities to assist them in such works as the abatement of rates to people in receipt of age pen sions, the provision of certain social welfare services such as <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres and baby health centres, and the various kinds of relief work that local authorities are called upon to perform in the nature of social services but for which no direct payment is made to the local authorities and which has to be met out of their rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When it come to tax concessions, of course, if you allow a deduction of $300 for education and a man is a 50c in the $1 taxpayer, he is given an educational endowment of $150 for his <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Furthermore, since the right honourable gentleman referred to the role of the States I ask him why it is that this year’s Budget, like last year’s Budget, has done nothing to fulfil  Sir John  McEwen’s undertaking, given at the last elections, that Commonwealth funds would be made available through the State governments as a contribution to the costs in the smaller centres of population of such amenities as swimming pools, <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, civic centres, showgrounds and playing fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One outstanding feature is the attention that has been paid to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, which has not been increased for years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party says that housekeeping does not fill in the time so they have to have another <span class="highlight">child</span> to keep reasonably busy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, I am glad to see the rise in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and in pensions although I should have liked to have seen some form of automatic cost of living adjustment for pensioners, for pensioners of all people have the least margin to absorb increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has certainly granted increases in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to families with more than 2 children but this increase can be completely absorbed by increased pharmaceutical benefit charges when sickness strikes, so it is another case of the Government giving with one hand and taking with the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To those families with fewer than 2 children it is not just another increased charge but a 100 per cent increase in a charge, an increase that the Government is asking the lower paid family man to bear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A family of 4 children now receives $5.75 a week in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, and it may be as well to remember that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment itself is one of the many innovations in the field of social services that was made originally by a Liberal government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This benefit will be of enormous assistance to all those pensioners and widows with dependent children, and indicates the concern of this Government to provide for their welfare and assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the Christmas session of Parliament in one of our State legislatures  Sir Arthur  Rylah asked, in a matter concerning cruelty to children: ‘How far must taxpayers be expected to go in looking after other people’s children’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However,  Sir Arthur  Rylah’s question might be rephrased: ‘How far should working class taxpayers be expected to deny their own children primary education in order to subsidise the secondary and tertiary education of those who can afford to pay fees of $400 a year or more?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment will cost about $26.5m per year, and will benefit about 1,020,000 children, comprised in about 610,000 families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The total annual cost of the benefits, that is, of pensions and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, included in the present Bill is thus about $92m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I now come to the provisions of the Bill which are specifically oriented towards the family and the welfare of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First let me deal with the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment provisions in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment is payable at the rate of 50c a week for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 years in a family, $1 a week for the second <span class="highlight">child</span>, $1.50 for the third <span class="highlight">child</span>, with cumulative increases of 25c a week for each subsequent <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Endowment in respect of children in institutions is paid at a flat rate of $1.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> endowment is now an accepted feature of family income and for some time the Government has been concerned that the larger family has been more adversely affected by wage and price increases than the smaller family with, say, one or two children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government believes that at the present time an effective way of providing real benefits to the larger family is by way of increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, the proposal in the Bill before the House is to increase endowment for the third and each subsequent <span class="highlight">child</span> in a family by 50c a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will mean that the rate of endowment in respect of the third <span class="highlight">child</span> in a family will become  $2  a week, in respect of the fourth <span class="highlight">child</span> $2.25 a week and so on, increasing by  25c  for each additional <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker, the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment increases in the Bill will, as I have said, benefit more than one million children, spread in more than 600,000 families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be remembered also that there are many other benefits and concessions provided by the Commonwealth that tend to offset the cost to parents of maintaining children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost to revenue of providing Income tax concessional deductions for children, including deductions in respect of education, exceeds some $250m a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assistance is given to families via the National Health Act where the family insurance rates for a family with children - however many children - are pegged at the rate applicable to a married couple without children; special assistance is also provided for handicapped children and children of pensioners, the last a matter which I shall deal with more fully in a moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these exemplify the attitude of a responsible government, which is to provide benefits in respect of children in a way which will assist in making them better citizens of tomorrow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now let me come to a most significant part of the Bill - a massive increase in the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance payable to all pensioners - age, invalid and widows, as well as to the recipients of unemployment and sickness benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government has examined their representations very carefully, and now proposes to increase the payment for the first <span class="highlight">child</span>, which at present is $2.50 a week, by $2 a week, making it $4.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance was introduced in 1943, and when the Chifley Government went out of office in 1949 it was paid only in respect of the first <span class="highlight">child</span> of invalid pensioners and age pensioners who were invalids, and only at the rate of 90c a week - equal to about $2.25 a week at today’s prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Widows under the Chifley Government received no <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance at all, except for the 50c a week difference between the class A widow’s pension and age and invalid pension rates then current. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1963 payments for the second and subsequent children of invalid pensioners and age pensioners who were invalids, were increased to $1.50 a week and a payment of $1.50 a week was introduced for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> of widows. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For the first time widows with dependent children received a mother’s allowance of $4 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tn 1965 the children of all age pensioners were included, and a ‘guardian’s allowance’ of $4 a week was introduced for single pensioners who had the custody of a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>dien was increased to $3.50 a week, and mothers’ and guardians’ allowances were increased to $6 a week where there was a <span class="highlight">child</span> under 6 or an invalid <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the first <span class="highlight">child</span> of an ex-serviceman whose death was related to war service, an increase of $1 a week will be payable, while the rate payable in respect of second and subsequent children will be increased by $2 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The weekly rate for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> rises by $1 o $7, and the rate for each other <span class="highlight">child</span> rises by $2 to $7, thus bringing the weekly rate of pension for each <span class="highlight">child</span> of a deceased seaman to a uniform amount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although it was always difficult to be sure exactly what was meant by the then Prime Minister when he used that term there is no doubt that the reference he made during the Senate election campaign late last year to the establishment of <span class="highlight">child</span> care cum kindergarten centres did indicate his Government’s intention to make some financial grants to this level of the State’s education system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Through the ability of their parents to send them to kindergartens and to pay the fees which often amount to $1 a day, these lucky children have an advantage denied to the great majority of youngsters in either the less affluent or newly developing suburbs or towns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The letters go on to point out the obvious fact that by the Federal and State governments accepting additional responsibility for preschool education all children will be able to benefit and, furthermore, the current heavy burden on parents will be greatly relieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the period from 1961 to 1970 concessional deductions for a man’s spouse, his first <span class="highlight">child</span> and subsequent children have each been increased by $26. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I agree that the Budget - rather belatedly and begrudgingly - gives increases in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment of 50c a week for each <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 after the second <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has reversed the election promise to reduce taxation; it has ignored the pledge to pay special attention to the chronically ill; it has sabotaged the undertaking to establish a national system of kindergarten <span class="highlight">child</span> minding” centres; it has failed in its social welfare programme to make adequate provision for those most in need; it has forgotten its indication to act on the report of the nation-wide survey on education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting to note that a husband and his wife and one <span class="highlight">child</span> would have needed to earn on these criteria $42.68 a week in the June quarter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The figure for the family group of a husband, wife and 2 children was given as $49.91 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The family group of a husband, wife and 3 children would need to have an income of $52.56 a week to be on a very stringent poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The family group in Victoria of a husband, wife and 4 children would need $59.86 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The family group of a husband, wife and 5 children on $67.44 would have no hope of qualifying under this scheme, nor would the family group of a husband, wife and 6 children on $74.97 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be seen that any family group in Victoria of a husband, wife and 3 or more children would be receiving such income that they would not be eligible for assistance under this subsidised medical scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, for one <span class="highlight">child</span> there has been a long term run down of purchasing power relative to average weekly earnings because <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> has not been increased for very many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me refer to the case of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for 3 children under 16 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been an improvement to 30.4 per cent of average weekly earnings, but by the end of this financial year there will be a slump to 27-9 per cent of average weekly earnings in the pension for  a  widow supporting  a  dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> over 6 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we take the case of unemployment and sickness benefits for a man with a spouse and 2 children on short term benefits he is more than $21.50 below the poverty level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All widows except class A who are supporting one <span class="highlight">child</span> under the age of 6 are at present below the updated poverty level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance the Melbourne survey showed that one <span class="highlight">child</span> in 10 lives in poverty in that city; that one aged person in 4 lives in poverty; and that 3 out of 10 widows are poor and one invalid in 4 is also poor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a further indication of what I mean I point out that only one <span class="highlight">child</span> in 4 at a Government school completes the full period of secondary schooling whereas 8 out of 10 children at non-Catholic private schools complete their full period of secondary schooling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the case of the <span class="highlight">child</span> deductibility allowance, where there is a family of a man, his wife and 3 children, and he receives a salary of $2,700 a year, he will gain a tax saving of about $99; whereas the man with a salary of $16,000 a year will gain a saving of $406 on his tax payment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, perhaps the most significant part of the Bill is the $2 increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> allowance payable to all age, invalid and widow pensioners, as well as to recipients of unemployment and sickness benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that there are many widows who are not aware of their entitlements under this Bill; it will enable many widows who can supplement their income to stay at home and look after their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Before commenting on this section of the legislation, I should first like to trace the history of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, which I submit is most interesting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1926 a New South Wales Labor Government introduced <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for the first time in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The payment at that time was 50c for each <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of its first deeds was to abolish the payment of 50c for the first <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Later in 1941 the Menzies Government introduced <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The payment at that time was 50c for each <span class="highlight">child</span> except the first <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1941 the federal basic wage was based on an amount deemed to be sufficient for a man, his wife and 3 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The judge in his wisdom said that he considered the basic wage was sufficient only for a man, wife and one <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>increase in the basic wage unless <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment was introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it can be readily seen that over a period of 7 years from 1941 to 1948 during the war years and early post-war era 2 Labor governments were responsible for doubling <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment despite the fact that the basic wage had increased by only $4 over that period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1950 the Menzies Government introduced the payment of 50c for the first <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In January 1964 the Menzies Government’ increased the payment for the third <span class="highlight">child</span> by 50c from $1 to $1.50 and the payment for each successive <span class="highlight">child</span> by the same amount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1967 the Holt Government increased the payment by 25c from $1.50 to $1.75 for the fourth <span class="highlight">child</span> and by 50c from $1.50 to $2 for the fifth <span class="highlight">child</span> with a further 25c added for each successive addition to the number of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the endowment of 50c for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> has not been adjusted for 21 years and the endowment for the second <span class="highlight">child</span> of $1 for 23 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the increases in this legislation, 85 per cent of endowed families, that is, in the first <span class="highlight">child</span> and 2 children categories, will not receive any increase at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In most cases the increases to those familes with 3 or more children will be a welcome benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major cause of this decline has been the failure of the Government to increase the rates for the first and second children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Commonwealth statistics show, those families in the lower income brackets have the highest number of children, but many parents today are hesitant about having larger families simply because they cannot afford to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I re-emphasise that the initial step is to increase the payments for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> arid second <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> endowment, a measure first introduced by the Liberal-Country Party Government as was generously recognised by the honourable member for Sydney  (Mr Cope),  has been increased for third and subsequent children, so that a family with 3 children receives a total income supplement of $2.50 a week while a family with 4 children receives $5.75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this side of the House we have always believed that particular help should be given to families with children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increases in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for the third and subsequent children will <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Budget there were great increases in the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance so that $4.50 a week will be paid for each <span class="highlight">child</span>, representing an increase of $2 for the first and $1 for subsequent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, a widow with 3 dependant children will receive a total payment of $38.25, or $45 if she had 4 dependant children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The special attention that is being given to assistance to families with children stands as a key feature of the social services programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if we do not increase any pensions, unemployment benefits, maternity benefits or <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, each year we would see an increase in the expenditure on social welfare simply because our population is forever increasing and because the number of people who are eligible for those benefits is increasing, So it is just futile and fatuous to talk about record expenditures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fifthly, the rate of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for the third and each subsequent <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 years of age in a family is to be increased by 50c per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sixthly, the rate of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for each <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 years of age in an approved institution is to be increased by 50c per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, children’s allowances for age, invalid and widow pensioners and for unemployment and sickness beneficiaries will increase by $2 per week for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> and by $1 per week for each other <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will bring the allowance to a uniform $4.50 per week for all these children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 683,000 age pensioners who will receive $40,300,000; 119,000 invalid pensioners who will receive $7,300,000; 76,000 widow pensioners who will receive $4,400,000; 5,000 long term sickness pensioners who will receive $300,000; 31,000 in the classification of wives of pensioners and beneficiaries who will receive $1,700,000; and 155,000 children of pensioners and beneficiaries who will receive $12m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment will cost about $26,500,000 and will benefit 1,020,000 children in about 610,000 families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has neglected its responsibility in regard to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for the first <span class="highlight">child</span>; also the unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other items in the Social Services Act such as the wife’s allowance and allowances for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> of pensioners have gone as long as 9 years without any increase, with a total increase of only $2.35 over  a  period of 20 years, or an average of 12c a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> and the second <span class="highlight">child</span>, the maternity allowance and the funeral benefit, it is anybody’s guess as to how many years will elapse before we see any alteration in those items. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> endowment for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> has not increased during the past 21 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This obviously means, if we look at past performances, that pensioners can forget about any further increases in <span class="highlight">child</span> allowance for at least the next 3 years, or even perhaps for the next 7 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mothers can forget about any further increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for at least 5 years, and perhaps 8 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They can forget altogether, about the possibility of any increase for the first and second <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say this because the Minister referred to an overall plan and because the last increase for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> of a pensioner was in 1968, and before that in 1961. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the second, and other children the last increase was in 1969, and there was a period between 1963 and 1968 when there were no increases given at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment the increase now proposed for the third <span class="highlight">child</span> is the first since 1964 and, for the fourth <span class="highlight">child</span>, since 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment this time applies only in cases where there are more than 2 children in a family and as the amount is only 50c, at a time when the Government places emphasis on children’s needs, it must be pretty obvious that any increase daring the next 4 years or so will be very small indeed, if there is any increase at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1949 <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment paid to a family with 3 children - which is close to the number of children in the average family - represented 11.3 per cent of the average male earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this Budget, a family with 3 children will receive $3.50  a  week in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Average male earnings are now $88.50 a week, so <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment represents less than 3.95 per cent of average male earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A comparison with the minimum wage also shows how the value of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment has dropped over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1948 when the minimum wage was $11.60 a week, a family with 5 children received $4 a week in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To retain the same relationship <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment now should be over $11 for a family with 5 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment does not make up for the loss Of purchasing power through inflation over the years, .lust recently Professor Ehrlich criticised the increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment not because the amount was insufficient but because the increase might result in more children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a couple had more children as a result of this miserable increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, they would be gluttons for punishment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>lt is interesting to analyse how the family income shrinks as extra children come along. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first <span class="highlight">child</span> arrives and the tax is reduced to $3.40 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The couple receive 50c a week <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, which gives the family $43.40 a week, or $14.47 each. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the third <span class="highlight">child</span>, tax paid weekly is $2.40 and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment is $3.50 a week, leaving the family income at $47.40, or $9.48 for each unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to deal briefly with the position of pensioners’ children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is at the moment no way in which a pensioner’s children can adequately be provided with a norma) education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe that if a person qualifies for a pension, especially an invalid pension, and has young children, some scheme should be evolved whereby his children can be provided with the wherewithal to obtain the education to which they are entitled and which is within their capacity to receive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We prolong the poverty cycle by forcing children to become self-conscious of the fact that they cannot participate in a normal manner in the affairs of their school because of the incomes of their parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We prolong the cycle by creating a second class student in denying children of pensioners the normal opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 wonder what a pensioner’s <span class="highlight">child</span> thinks when the rest of the school, especially if it is a high school, is coming to Canberra to have a look at Parliament House, which I would hope would be a part of their education, but because of the costs involved the <span class="highlight">child</span> cannot have that part of his education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also true to say that in most oases the children of pensioners are forced to leave school at an earlier age, unless they are extremely lucky, because of the incomes of their families and the economic circumstances in which they find themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are in fact denied the normal opportunities of other children in the community because of the economic circumstances of their parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it should be a high priority item on any government’s agenda to ensure that these children are given the same opportunities as other children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would not seek to answer the honourable member for Corio  (Mr Scholes)  in detail, but I will take up one of the last points he made in relation to the children of pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is anything which this Budget has done and if there is anything which the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  has sought to do it is to increase very significantly the children’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The children’s allowance which is appropriate to the children of pensioners has been increased by $2 for the first <span class="highlight">child</span>, $1 for the second <span class="highlight">child</span> and, taking into account concomitant alterations in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for the third and later children, for the third <span class="highlight">child</span> of a pensioner the allowance has been increased by $1.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But children have always been a necessity of life, and this is something of which this Government has continuously taken account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It enables me to remind the House that in Chifley’s time virtually no allowance was made for children at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, there was only a meagre allowance for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> of age and invalid pensioners and none for the others; and then an allowance was given only when the age pensioner was an invalid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, we have put on for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> in the shape of a mother’s allowance an extra pension of S4 if the <span class="highlight">child</span> is over 6 years of age and $6 if there is a <span class="highlight">child</span> under 6 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the family endowment and mothers allowance together, for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> there is an extra payment of $9 and if there is more than one <span class="highlight">child</span> it is about $7 per <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to  address  the House tonight on a matter which I consider to be of the utmost importance to every man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister for Labour and National Service relating to the continued inactivity by the Government on its undertaking given during the Senate election campaign to establish or assist <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710910_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman refers to a proposal in relation to <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres made during the Senate election campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710910_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The children’s allowance will be $7 a week; an orphan <span class="highlight">child</span> - when both the father and the mother have died - will be paid $14 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710910_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the purposes of the survey, which was carried out in the June Quarter 1966, the poverty line for a standard family comprising husband, wife and two dependent children was arbitrarily set at $33 per week, that being equivalent to the then Victorian basic wage of $30.70 per week plus <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for two children plus a loading of 80 cents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710910_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under a third proposal a concessional deduction will be available for legal expenses and fees incurred by taxpayers in adopting children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It it proposed that a taxpayer who adopts a <span class="highlight">child</span> will be allowed an income tax deduction for amounts expended in connection with the adoption by way of solicitors’ or barristers’ fees, fees paid to a court granting the adoption order and fees paid to a Government department or authority or to an approved adoption agency through which the adoption is arranged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the right honourable gentleman aware that the unemployment benefit for a man with a dependent wife and one <span class="highlight">child</span> is only 22 per cent of average weekly earnings? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With a substantial rise in unemployment expected because of the Government’s budgetary policies, will the Prime Minister consider an immediate increase in the present benefits of $10 for a single man and $19.50 for a man with a dependent wife and one <span class="highlight">child</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his second reading speech the Treasurer announced that part of the Budget proposals consists of a decision by the Government to increase from $300 to $400 per annum the maximum deduction allowable to a taxpayer for the education expenses of a dependent full time student <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The idea originated in the Budget of 19S2 when, for the first time, a concessional deduction was allowed for education expenses of dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time it related to payment of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for the second and subsequent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments and social service payments generally have been extended there is no longer a direct connection between payroll tax and the payment of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Payroll tax was introduced to Australia in  1941  specifically to provide the funds required for the payment of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to the families of wage and salary’ earners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another of the reasons why  1  am so against payroll tax being transferred to the States is that I believe this son of taxation should be used specifically for other social welfare measures - indeed, let us include <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever is given in increases in pensions and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment will be more than swallowed up in increased costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>It gives the very minimum in the way of benefits in respect of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, pensions and assistance to rural industry and education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me relate to the Minister the case of a widow with 8 children, 6 of whom were going to school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The eldest <span class="highlight">child</span> who was 19 years of age was selected out of the barrel for national service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I made strong representations on behalf of this distressed woman who was losing the eldest <span class="highlight">child</span> of her family under the National Service Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The establishment of Maternal and <span class="highlight">Child</span> Health Centres throughout Papua New Guinea to advise mothers on health matters including nutrition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-39-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not unusual, however, for Aborigines themselves to choose European names which they use in conjunction with a subsection name and a mother will usually choose a European name for her <span class="highlight">child</span> for birth registration purposes; nursing sisters frequently assist the mother in this by providing a panel of names from which she may choose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-39-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If a senior member of an Aboriginal family or the eldest <span class="highlight">child</span> chooses a European name as a surname, junior members of the family are encouraged to use that name. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-39-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government announced its desire to introduce a scheme to assist with <span class="highlight">child</span>-care centres in November last year against a background of concern that the care and welfare of the children of working parents should be adequately safeguarded and that such children should have every opportunity for the fullest development, intellectually, socially and physically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710930_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-45-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government continues to hold this view, and continues to regard its intended initiative on <span class="highlight">child</span> care as a most valuable and important one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710930_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-45-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was because of its appreciation of the importance of restraining the inflationary, pressures which are currently evident in the community that the Government adopted a deliberate policy of curtailing Commonwealth expenditure and it was in the light of that policy that the decision was taken to defer any proposal on <span class="highlight">child</span> care for the time being. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710930_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-45-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> care assistance in the case of single parent families is part of the considerations underway with respect to the whole initiative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710930_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-45-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As some 20 million refugees and displaced persons are today facing acute problems of hunger and privation - nutrition and <span class="highlight">child</span> family problems- ultimate famine and death on an unprecedented scale- the Commonwealth Government must plan to come to their assistance in a more sacrificial way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is only in the Territories that every <span class="highlight">child</span> has at least one year of preschool education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I quote the percentages of children who can have pre-school education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that we will not again have a ministerial statement on education without mentioning the opportunity for pre-school education which, in the interest of future equality, every <span class="highlight">child</span> in the States should have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In approximate terms, this means a husband supporting a wife and one <span class="highlight">child</span> on actual income of $2,250 would be fully covered by our programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An allowance of actual annual income of $156 would be allowed for each additional <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government decided finally that health insurance should not be used as the vehicle for assistance to large families because other welfare measures such as taxation concessions and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment currently provide assistance of this nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I noticed another very worthwhile provision that many people here have requested; that is a provision relating to a working wife who has to place a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a day nursery, play centre, creche or kindergarten, or who has to employ somebody to come into the home to look after the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot help thinking, of course, that it would be infinitely better if they could place their children in a free kindergarten or creche as many people in this capital city, Canberra, are able to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The same would apply to the deduction which is presently allowable for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time the estimated loss of revenue if the deduction were disallowed is $88m for the first <span class="highlight">child</span>, $12m for the student <span class="highlight">child</span>, and $76m for the other children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So, for example, the allocations to independent schools might be a percentage of the cost of educating an average <span class="highlight">child</span> in the State system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in my view a requirement that the educational facilities available to a <span class="highlight">child</span> should be of roughly comparable standard whether that <span class="highlight">child</span> is born in Western Australia or New South Wales or Queensland or wherever it may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Commonwealth expenditure on the <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education programme has increased from $109,000 in 1969-70 to $2,610,000 this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To foster these skills and desires, a <span class="highlight">child</span> needs to have access to a wide range of literature at varying levels of interest, reading ability and also covering many topics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must bring the libraries into the area of children - into the schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is, of course, understandable because this ministry, which was created in 1966 out of political expediency, has, since its establishment, been somewhat the neglected <span class="highlight">child</span> of successive coalition governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So on the pure issue of justice in a country where education is compulsory no-one can deny the right of a parent to send his <span class="highlight">child</span> to the school of his choice provided that the standard of education is met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the great things in this country, I believe, is freedom of religion and a parent therefore has the right to give his <span class="highlight">child</span> a basic moral and religious education if he so chooses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth grants are $35 for each primary school <span class="highlight">child</span> and $50 for each secondary school <span class="highlight">child</span>, which averages out at something under $40 for each <span class="highlight">child</span> per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Direct expenditure on education by the Commonwealth today amounts to an average of $125 for each <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Less than $40 for each <span class="highlight">child</span> is going to the independent schools, so it can be seen that the independent schools are at a very great disadvantage at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The churches, and the friends and the parents of children going to independent schools pay at least an additional $300 a <span class="highlight">child</span> to educate children in independent schools so this amount is a saving to the States and to the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that a system could be worked out whereby a contribution for education could be made to every <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia as a right, with the States making up the balance in the State education systems and the parents and friends making up the difference for the independent schools’ requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in my opinion all children are entitled equally to a share of assistance in education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children have a right to be given the kind of education that their parents desire for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth could assist the schools by means of per capita payments in respect of each school <span class="highlight">child</span> whether at a government or an independent school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is completely phoney to say that when parents are taxed to the hilt, and they do not have large incomes anyhow, they have the right to pay fees to send their children to independent schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the true position is that children who come from a background which is not conducive to extra curricular assistance are sent to schools which are ill equipped with facilities and on occasions staffed with teachers who are only marking time until a vacancy occurs at a school in a more affluent area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The best way to ensure that this happens is to see that every <span class="highlight">child</span>, irrespective of background or the financial standing of the family, is assured of the opportunity to be educated to the capacity of his intellect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another matters that bugs me quite a bit is the question of the pre-school education of Australian children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am interested in pre-school education because I firmly believe that a sound education for our children and .young people is a necessary requirement for Australia’s future security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the technical age in which we live far more has to be learned and absorbed in a shorter time, consequently in my view pre-school education does much to assist the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aspects of pre-school education which concern me greatly are that not every <span class="highlight">child</span> has the opportunity of receiving such education, mainly because there are far too few preschool centres; there is great difficulty in obtaining the requisite staff to increase the number of centres; attendance frequently is on a roster basis and the cost of maintaining a <span class="highlight">child</span> at a centre in some circumstances <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>stances precludes the parent from permitting a <span class="highlight">child</span> to take advantage of such education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, when a <span class="highlight">child</span> is enrolled his parents should automatically become members of the parents association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also extremely difficult to give a <span class="highlight">child</span> motivation, but it can be done through the education system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment deprivation in the home - that is, in the homes of low income earners, in migrant homes, in Aboriginal homes, in the homes of unskilled workers and in broken homes - and the lack of a proper cultural environment retards children from this background and perpetuates inequality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present the Government grants $55 a head for primary students, $80 for each <span class="highlight">child</span> in forms 1 and 2, $90 for each <span class="highlight">child</span> in forms 3 and 4 and $95 for each <span class="highlight">child</span> in forms 5 and 6. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that if the church has difficulty - and I am quite concerned that people should have freedom to give their children the education which they want to give them - one of the solutions may well be that those Catholics who are part of the State school teaching staff should be free to teach in church schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other schools - I do not say this as a criticism but as a statement of fact - from other churches in the main have not attempted to reach every <span class="highlight">child</span> with their form of religious education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that from the point of view of meeting the needs of children we should look at the needs of the children and the needs of the schools and give priority to those who are in greatest need and not to those who are in schools which, because they can charge high fees, can provide adequate facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As some twenty million refugees and displaced persons are today facing acute problems of hunger and privation - nutrition and <span class="highlight">child</span> family problems - ultimate famine and death on an unprecedented scale - the Commonwealth Government must plan to come to their assistance in a more sacrificial way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-0-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The specialist anaesthetist is highly trained in a number, of specialised tasks, such as the administration of anaesthetics, supervision of patients in the post-operative recovery ward, intensive care of patients with life threatening respiratory and circulatory conditions, the management of unconscious patients, and the relief of pain such as that associated with the early post-operative period, with certain chronic diseases or with <span class="highlight">child</span> birth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>if we believe it to be true that the range of experience of the doctor-in-training should be broadened, then we should be creating elective attachments and a teaching atmosphere in a spectrum of institutions which have not hitherto been regarded as being worthy of affiliation with medical schools - industrial health clinics, geriatric day-centres, rehabilitation centres, psychiatric clinics and day-centres, clinics for drug addicts, <span class="highlight">child</span> guidance centres, and remedial centres for autistic and dyslexic children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although constantly there have been rising expenditures on Aboriginal affairs, nevertheless it is always possible, it seems to me, for someone like the honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman)  to point out that Aboriginal infant mortality is rising, Aboriginal neo-natal mortality is rising and Aboriginal <span class="highlight">child</span> mortality is rising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There were 135,000 children involved in claims by taxpayers whose incomes were within that range. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For those taxpayers whose income exceeded $4,000 the nominal value of education expenses claimed was $132m and the number of children covered was 1,265,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We simply ask at this point: Who is it that benefits when this Government increases, as it does  ‘.n  this Bill, the concessional claim from $300 to $400 for each <span class="highlight">child</span> for education expenses, which broadly cover fees, fares, books, uniforms, when by far the greatest number of claims now made for children barely average more than $100 a <span class="highlight">child</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By contrast to the $ 1, 000m to which I have referred and which is distributed in this rather regressive way - 1 repeat, this is for the year ended 30th June 1969 - is an item which appears in the Budget for the same year described as cash benefits to persons, namely, amounts paid by reason of social services, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, medical and pharmaceutical benefits and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> endowment is paid irrespective of the income of the parents, but the higher the income of the taxpayer, the more the taxation concession is worth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have made the suggestion before as a sort of rough improvement in equity that if the concessions for dependants - that is, wives and children - were doubled for everybody - I accept the fact that they would be doubled for the wealthy as well as for the poor - and if all other deductions were eliminated the saving to revenue would be about $200m as a consequence and the majority of taxpayers were dependants, particularly those families where there there is only one breadwinner, would be advantaged if that were the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would be additional deductions for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there were a proper medical benefits scheme and a proper <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment scheme there would be no need to worry about whether a taxpayer is allowed concessions for children or for medical items and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take the new education concession, which in this Budget has gone from $300 to $400 per <span class="highlight">child</span>: For a man on a taxable income of $20,000 this is worth to him $266 in rough terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By giving a rebate of so much per <span class="highlight">child</span> the money can in effect be paid straight to the parent from the Commonwealth Government and not through the other mechanism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that while education expenses under the Act include those for uniforms, fares, fees, books, etc., the fares alone with regard to children travelling long distances and who go home during the year - surely they are entitled to do that - would be very close to the allowable maximum deduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So even if the <span class="highlight">child</span> went home only once during the school year it would mean that at least half the maximum amount would be used up on fares. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In giving consideration to these amendments it must be borne in mind also that like every other form of concessional deduction such as for spouse, medical costs, children, etc., the amount of deduction is not a direct deduction from taxation itself but simply a reduction in actual income for the purpose of arriving at the income upon which tax will be imposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that deductions apply to actual incomes and not to the tax itself means, for instance, that this proposed SI CO addition to the education allowance will give to a taxpayer with one <span class="highlight">child</span> attending school and on an otherwise taxable income of $1,500  -  that is, of course, if he can afford to spend $400 on the education of his <span class="highlight">child</span> - an actual tax reduction of approximately $16 while another taxpayer with a taxable income of $15,000 and with one <span class="highlight">child</span> at school could gain a tax saving of approximately $58 - $16 in one case and $58 in the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This could be a fact even though both taxpayers live in the same street and meet exactly the same education expenses for children attending the same school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course when there are 2 children in each family, or 3 or 4, then the man with a higher income gets an even greater advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact it is obvious from taxation statistics that the great bulk of the taxpayers obtain very little real help from the existing allowance of $300, and those same taxpayers will receive no benefit at all from any increase whether it be $100 or $1,000, for the very simple reason that the low income earner cannot afford to pay out $6 or $8 a week for the education of a <span class="highlight">child</span>, or twice or three times that amount if he has 2 or 3 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a very big problem in distant areas, this cost of giving the children a good education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>million to  4i  million taxpayers with incomes of less than that amount, while taxpayers with incomes above $6,000 total only approximately 660,000, which proves, as I said earlier, that the great bulk of the taxpayers will gain very little from the additional $100 and that where any benefit is gained it will go largely to those who actually do not require it and in fact are well situated to meet the cost of their children’s education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, that group of taxpayers whose incomes ranged from $417 to $1,599 in 1968-69 claimed an average amount of approximately $57 a <span class="highlight">child</span> for some 64,500 children of over one million taxpayers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear from those figures that those taxpayers and those children will derive no benefit at all from this increase of $100, and they would in most instances be stretching the purse even to reach the $57. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we have the group whose incomes range from $2,400 to $2,599, a group comprising approximately 252,000 taxpayers and 89,000-odd children with an average claim of $75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This group comprises 282,500 taxpayers and 293,000 children with an average claim of $96 for each <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are something like 320,000 taxpayers in the income group up to $6,000 who have 3 or more children and it is quite obvious that those taxpayers, except in a few instances, would find it very difficult and in fact impossible to pay out more than perhaps $50 or $60 towards each of their children’s education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore the children’s education suffers and the best this Government can do is to increase the concessional deduction which does absolutely nothing for these taxpayers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first taxpayer can receive $137 tax relief for a <span class="highlight">child</span> and the second taxpayer only $15. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some reason or other, whilst it is recognised that I can receive the benefit of taxation deductions for educational expenses incurred through my <span class="highlight">child</span> being at university, the student who is bearing his own costs of education cannot receive that necessary taxation deduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think I said that up to 20.000 migrant children are involved; I am advised that the figure is more than 20,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to say a few words about handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 1959 United Nations Declaration of the Rights of a <span class="highlight">Child</span> lays down a criterion in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> who is physically, mentally or socially handicapped shall be given the special treatment, education and care required by his particular condition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It always seems to me that there is something wrong with any society which treats as lavishly as we treat - though insufficiently in my view - the educational needs of ordinary, healthy, wholesome Australian children and then puts right at the end of the queue the <span class="highlight">child</span> who has a need for special care, the mentally and physically handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is to say, we relegate to charity, to a very considerable degree, the care of the physically and mentally handicapped people in this country: We have a long way to go to measure up to the criteria expressed in, for example, the Australian Public Instruction Act, the effect of which is to make the Minister for Education and Science  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  responsible for the provision of education services for all children on a free and compulsory basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when it comes to the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> we abandon this principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recently the parents of children who were accommodated by the New South Wales Handicapped Children’s Centre, which is located in my electorate at Kirrawee, circulated questionnaires. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The costs run as high as $1,100 for a 2-year period for a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Maybe the Minister could arrange for prescriptions issued in respect to a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> to be paid for by the Commonwealth in the same way as the pensioner medical service meets the needs of pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 am sure there are many parents listening to this broadcast at the moment who have had the experience of going to see the principal of a school to consult him about their <span class="highlight">child</span> only to find that the principal is in class and they have had to wait until the principal has come out of the class or else he has had to leave the class to come and talk with the parents about the problem concerning their <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711130_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In areas of cultural underprivilege where children normally are not exposed to fairly well educated parents the problems that these children face are infinitely greater than those of other children, even leaving out totally the economic aspects and dealing only with the educational opportunities and probabilities of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711130_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Once that <span class="highlight">child</span> reaches secondary school he will have lost th s educational opportunity, so I support the amendment because I am sure any inquiry would bring out the absolute need for children to receive assistance - especially assistance in learning - and to be exposed to good literature long before they go to secondary school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711130_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is considerable variation in the levels set as between schools and the figures given below represent an estimate of the average contribution per <span class="highlight">child</span> paid at pre-schools, primary and secondary schools,  (a)  Parents committees of pre-schools seek a contribution from parents which is used mainly to provide and maintain equipment at the pre-school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-59-71">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Australian Capital Territory this contribution averages about $8.50 per term for each <span class="highlight">child</span>; in the Northern Territory the average is a little higher, reflecting the fact that in the Northern Territory most children attending pre-school do so for more sessions per week than do children in the Australian Capita’ Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-59-71">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If you deny assistance to children at a non-government school, for every <span class="highlight">child</span> so prevented from attending a nongovernment school you prevent S400 being spent at the secondary level on an appropriate <span class="highlight">child</span> at the government level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The annual operating cost of a comprehensive school denial service in the Australian Capital Territory in 1970-71 was $12.66 for each <span class="highlight">child</span> examined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-37-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, each <span class="highlight">child</span> can have only one set of education at a time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The quality of the education a <span class="highlight">child</span> receives is determined not by his own capacity to learn by by his family’s capacity to earn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise that this is the position in the capital of Victoria, a State where 27 per cent of all eligible children find places in pre-school centres, and not in New South Wales, where only 3 per cent do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to develop a voucher system under which the parents can opt to receive from governments the amount which is spent in educating a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a government school and to spend that amount on the education of their own <span class="highlight">child</span> where and how they themselves wish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well-established, and everybody accedes to it, that parents have a right to decide the kind of education they want for their <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are additional standards sought by parents of children is independent schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is fair and just that a <span class="highlight">child</span> sent to an independent school should share on an equal basis with a <span class="highlight">child</span> sent to a State school money allocated by the Government to help meet the cost of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One might go so far as to say that everything near and dear to us is an integral part of education, as it all begins with the education of the young <span class="highlight">child</span> in the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the absence of such assistance it is most unfair to imply that parents supporting independent schools were more concerned with their children’s education than were parents of children in government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the most passionate involvement with a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s education matters little if the cash is not there to provide further education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 3 challenges were: Firstly, to affirm the right of every <span class="highlight">child</span> to assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an important challenge because I would suggest that Opposition members who are taking part in this debate should make up their minds as to whether they accept the principle that every <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia has a right to be assisted by the Government in his education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members opposite accept that right then I ask them: ‘How dare you seek to derogate from that right by diminishing the amount that any <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia may receive from the Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you end up giving them no assistance you will deny the right entirely and to the extent to which you diminish the amount paid with respect to any <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia so too you will correspondingly diminish your recognition of that right.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Capital expenditure on education at government schools per <span class="highlight">child</span> population in South Australia is in fact the highest in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many parents of State school children can afford to take advantage of that by spending more than $300 on a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real beneficiaries are the parents of children at the wealthy private schools, the people whom the Liberals represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the wealthy schools that were attended by the Cabinet Ministers and now are being attended by their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cannot be argued, as the Minister sometimes has done, that this taxation deduction is a help to children in the depressed rural areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government wanted to provide equitable and real help to farmers children, it would do what the South Australian Government has done, namely, provide a direct grant at a level assessed according to needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one wants to compensate a <span class="highlight">child</span> from a poor family to provide an equal opportunity in life, one must discriminate in his favour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With an equal grant to all, the rich <span class="highlight">child</span> at the well-off private school will finish up still further in front of the deprived <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I made, I believe, was that in a case where one <span class="highlight">child</span>’s parents may be less concerned than another’s about their children’s education, the Minister has clearly stated he believes that the Government should not intervene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A more correct version would be to say that education is paid for by the taxpayers, irrespective of whether they have children or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if education is to be free, it should be free to all Australian children as a right, irrespective of the school of their choice, provided that the school maintains required standards and the exercising of that choice does not cost the taxpayer more than if the <span class="highlight">child</span> were educated at a government school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time only about 75 per cent of children are educated at government schools and something like 25 per cent are, by their parents’ choice, educated at other schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, government schools have the facilities to cater for only three-quarters of the number of school children in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So parents of children attending government primary schools have fees of $333 paid by the Government for their children, and parents of children attending government secondary schools have fees of $607 paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if we add together the per capita grant of the Commonwealth and the grant of the State Government in Victoria we find that children attending independent schools have fees paid by the Government of only $90 at primary level and $108 at secondary level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely all Australian children should be treated equally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provided that children go to a school of a required standard they should be entitled to equal assistance from the Government for the cost of their education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If their parents choose to send them to a school which offers something extra, then that is their choice and they should pay any additional fees involved over and above what the cost would be to the Government of educating these children in a government school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would treat every <span class="highlight">child</span> equally, it would retain our dual system of education and it would give parents the choice of where their children were educated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would cost the taxpayer no more than if all children were compulsorily educated in government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these grants did not exist, the parents would be forced to pay that extra amount in added fees or to take their children away and send them to a government school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is ridiculous to assume that all parents who send their children to independent and church schools are wealthy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is certainly not true of the Catholic parish schools and it is not true of those who make great sacrifices to send their children to the larger church schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the larger church schools the fees for one <span class="highlight">child</span> alone, would amount to something like $1,100 a year, yet by sending a <span class="highlight">child</span> to such a school that parent, who is also a taxpayer, is saving the Government - on the figures of  Mr Lindsay  Thompson, the Victorian Minister for Education- $607. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the position we should be working towards - one realises that it cannot happen overnight - is the situation where each <span class="highlight">child</span> is entitled to and allotted the $607 towards his education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr FitzPATRICK (Darling) (11.13)- I would like to present a case for assistance to those children who cannot go to school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am referring to the children of parents who live in isolated areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the parents in these areas have formed themselves into an association known as the Isolated Children Parents Association which represents the most educationally isolated districts in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the Association is to bring to the attention of the public and the Government the isolated rural <span class="highlight">child</span>’s lack of educational opportunities and how children beyond daily reach of school are grossly neglected educationally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Living away means an added expense of between $400 and $1,000 and more per annum per <span class="highlight">child</span> and, of course, some parents have 4 or 5 children of school age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, their taxation allowance for education is the same as that of parents whose children do not incur any accommodation fee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is claimed that the cost for parents with 3 children living away while attending secondary school would amount to $1,200 to $5,400 a year, and this does not include books, uniforms or fares. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then he suggested sending the children to NSW schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, we have 2 children at NSW schools and let’s face iti The marvellous subsidy we receive a mere $117 per year, we can only alford to send 2 children away as to get down to bare facts, we have to find another seven hundred dollars for each <span class="highlight">child</span> per year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or does he not realise that to send an isolated <span class="highlight">child</span> to school boarding fees are anywhere from $20 to $30 per week without extras and our children do not have any unnecessary extras as we just have not the cash. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">child</span> who has daily access to school is eligible for free transport and schooling regardless of its parents’ income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The children who live beyond daily reach of school - they represent a fraction of the nation’s school children - are not granted free travel and what assistance is granted is subject to a means test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To prevent these children joining the ranks of unemployed and those nearly unemployable because of their low educational standard, immediate assurance of aid must be given to parents, to schools and to hostels to ensure that these children can complete their education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The average rural family is larger than its urban counterpart and this again places a heavier burden on the isolated parent who must find finance for boarding children in order to give them access to school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A <span class="highlight">child</span> from a culturally under-privileged family has less starting opportunity than have normal children and therefore requires greater encouragement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a need for those children who do not get a head start, as it is commonly termed in the United States, to be given the additional facilities which are necessary to assist them to overcome the gap that separates them from more fortunate children at their starting-out point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 believe that it is placing the cart before the horse to provide secondary school libraries without giving serious consideration to the position of primary schools and, even more importantly in areas in which the basic educational standards of parents is low - these areas are fairly well known to all of us - without taking the necessary action to provide a satisfactory level of pre-school education, which can be vital to a young <span class="highlight">child</span> starting out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So we have a situation where a <span class="highlight">child</span> of 16, 17 or 18 years who is starting to become a very expensive luxury for any family is trying to cope with an adolescent life with the normal costs of living at that age and obtaining an education on a basic income available to his family of something less than $40 a week and, quite often, something substantially less than $30 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>lt should look into the problems which are faced by people who receive social service benefits from the Commonwealth, because their children are just as entitled to the so-called free education which is supposedly available as is any other group of children in the community, but the Government chooses to pass sentence on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because their parents are not able to earn an adequate income these children arc sentenced to a lesser existence than other children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not always possible to provide a place for each <span class="highlight">child</span> in his/her neighbourhood, particularly in developing areas of Canberra, but places are normally available providing parents are prepared to transport their children to established preschools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-42-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I did see statements by a Professor Goldman from, I think, the La Trobe University to the effect that he had removed a <span class="highlight">child</span> from University High, which is one of the best schools in Victoria, and had placed her in a private school because he believed that government schools were inadequate in quality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would only like to suggest that if this is an accurate report, if this is what Professor Goldman has done, he will probably nave run the risk of placing his <span class="highlight">child</span> in a school of academic quality inferior to that of the one from which he has removed the <span class="highlight">child</span>, because University High is a school of high reputation and high standard; that, I think, would be undeniable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to add that if Professor Goldman is critical of the Australian system and if, for example, he were using the government system in Britain or Sweden, he would find that if his <span class="highlight">child</span> were 16 years of age she would have a much greater chance of still being at school in Australia than in Sweden or the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will already be familiar with the details of this, from the statements made by the right honourable the Prime Minister in December last year and May this year, and will know that the aim of the Government is to give independent schools an assurance that they will receive assistance on a basis that is continuing and that bears a relation to the cost of educating a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a government school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But let us examine the intention declared by  Sir Robert  Menzies that the scheme would enable children ‘to stay at school for a longer period than they might otherwise have done’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My comment on the field of education which we have just been discussing is that the whole of the scholarship system, which is a powerful determinant of economic assistance - unfortunately to those who need it least - is geared to the intellectual and verbal skills, and a <span class="highlight">child</span> who does not possess verbal skills will appear to be unintelligent when intrinsically he is not unin telligent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In New South Wales where government interest in pre-school education is all but non-existent, the cost to parents of pre-schooling is between $12 and $16 per week per <span class="highlight">child</span>, rising to $30 per week in well-to-do suburbs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The absence from the wonderfully stimulating environment of pre-school education of so many children is a tragedy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Disadvantaged children, especially linguistically .disadvantaged children, face an accumulating disadvantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Abroad they have carried out schemes whereby they have used preschool education successfully to eliminate this disadvantage from the <span class="highlight">child</span>, <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The language difficulties of disadvantaged children were seen to consist not of deficiencies in vocabulary and grammar as such, but of failure to master certain use of language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The disadvantaged <span class="highlight">child</span> masters a language which is adequate for maintaining social relationships and for meeting his social and material needs, but he does not learn to use language for obtaining and transmitting information, for monitoring his own behaviour and for carrying on verbal reasoning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In certain other fields of education, for instance, the Labor Party wishes to see adopted in both government and non government schools in this country a system which exists in the Inner London Education Authority whereby special assistance can be given to poor children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We speak very often about assisting poorer schools but there is a problem of poorer children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, on this reasoning, there are good grounds for assisting any poor <span class="highlight">child</span>, not merely Aboriginal poor children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the children, of widows, the children of deserted wives, all those children whose parents have to receive assistance from Departments of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Weir fare, should receive direct assistance from the Commonwealth for books, fees if they attend private schools, uniforms - all their educational needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A survey conducted on pre-school attendance in Melbourne by  Dr Marion  de Lemos, of the Australian Council of Educational Research, showed that the higher the socio-economic status of the suburb, the more likely a <span class="highlight">child</span> is to attend a preschool. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The survey showed that the children of fathers in professional, higher administrative and managerial positions were far more likely to go to pre-schools than the children of unskilled workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>“The pre-school,’ says  Dr De  Lemos, ‘clearly does not provide a service for the children of working mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The results confirm claims that pre-school facilities are not equitably distributed, and serve mainly to confer advantages on already advantaged middle class children rather than to equalise educational opportunities for children from less privileged backgrounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Kindergartens, if widely available and backed by adequate medical and psychological services, can provide opportunities for the early identification and treatment of handicaps of all types at a period in the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s life when corrective measures are likely to be most effective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apart from the more serious handicaps such as severe speech defects which may require specialist treatment, the kindergarten teacher as a skilled observer of children is able to detect areas in which individual children may need special help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not every mother in Australia wants her <span class="highlight">child</span> to go off to pre-school, yet clearly there are other mothers, and some fathers, who have no choice, for economic reasons, than to go to employment and leave young children in the care of others or alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Hughes  (Mr Les Johnson)  implied that the only people who are unaware of the apparent value of education for children under the age of 5 years are the people on this side of the House and that those clairvoyants opposite have long been in possession of the educational information which has recently come to hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only in very recent times that it has been shown, to any noticeable effect, that the capacity of the <span class="highlight">child</span> of under 5 years, or even of 3 years, is greater than it was previously thought to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that there was a certain degree of confusion - again on the part of the honourable member for Hughes - about <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres and pre-schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Undertakings made in respect of <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres as an adjunct to or even as a consequence of or a response to an increasing proportion of females in the work force are not the same as the establishment of or the responsibility to establish pre-school education on the part of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The response to that is to have somebody other than the mothers to look after the children at these low ages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am saying is that despite the great works that we may find in pre-schools, a great deal of what is offered, socially and educationally, could well be found in a good home environment between mother and <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless we should recognise the possibilities - or even the fact - that some people higher up the educational scale prefer to teach their children and have them close to them as much as possible at that early age rather than send them to pre-school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That may be right or it may be wrong but they are certainly exercising a parental preference which is available to parents under this system in contrast to the system in the Soviet Union where a great proportion of females work and State <span class="highlight">child</span>-minding centres in which there are children in great numbers, are found in profusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting that it is in this area that the first ideas of the free flow of the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s thought and activity inside the school takes place, but that increasingly, as he passes through the education system, he becomes more restricted and inhibited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There has not been the acceptance of the fact that pre-school training could play the important part in the total education of a <span class="highlight">child</span> which is now quite clearly demonstrated that it does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We realise and accept the fact that quite young children can absorb information quite effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is particularly important that teachers receive specialist training in this field if the full advantage of this type of education is to be provided for our children attending pre-schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I commend the Minister and the Government on the great progress that is being made, but I hope that very close consultation between the State Ministers for Education and the Commonwealth Minister for Education and Science will be maintained to ensure that the combined efforts of the Commonwealth Government and the State governments will be directed most effec tively towards achieving the common goal of providing the best possible standard of education for every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>First of all, there is a greater community awareness and appreciation of the educability of children in these early, tender years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not just a case of the intellectual development of the 2-year old, the 3-year old, the 4-year old or the 5-year old; equally important - some would rate it as even more important - is the emotional and social development of young children at this tender age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose this applies particularly to those children in a one-<span class="highlight">child</span> family - the only <span class="highlight">child</span> or the first <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But psychologists tell us that it is very important that even subsequent children should have this social and emotional development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in this country have been rather backward in acknowledging the educability of children in these early years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not so many years ago, most of us will probably remember, that we used to sneer at what was done in countries such as Russia and certain European countries which put young children into pre-schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was supposed to be State indoctrination in the early, tender years of a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have come to recognise that this attitude is idiotic and that in fact there is much to gain by young children having educational opportunities from about the age of 3 onwards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A recent survey of applications for <span class="highlight">child</span> care conducted by the Sydney Day Nursery Schools Association showed that 40 per cent of all applications were from oneparent families - usually a divorced mother, a widowed mother or a deserted wife - in which the mother had to work to support herself and the children, and that 47 per cent of 2-parent applications were from families in economic difficulties because of high rents, hire purchase debts or debts arising from illness or accident necessitating hospital and/or medical care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A survey conducted in 1970  -  of course, the figures have escalated since then - showed that the number of children in our Australian community between the ages of 3 and 5 was 699,000, of whom 203,000 were enrolled in schools, usually at the age of 5 years, and 74,000 were enrolled in pre-schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The very important point I want to highlight is that, in round figures, 200,000 children of working mothers were unable to get into schools or pre-schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many other mothers of young children said that if they could get a place for their <span class="highlight">child</span> in a preschool or <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre they would like to go into employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In New South Wales only 3 per cent of pre-school age children are in affiliated pre-schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If all kinds of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, many of which are unregistered, are taken into consideration, only 6 per cent of pre-school age children in New South Wales have the opportunity to go to a kindergarten or some other kind of pre-school facility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By contrast, 95 per cent of children of that age in the Australian Capital Territory have that opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What the Australian Labor Party is urging in its amendment is that all children in Australia should have the same privilege, if I may put it that way, as that enjoyed by the parents and their children who reside in the Australian Capital Territory, In New South Wales the Government pays only $935 a year towards a kindergarten teacher’s salary, but in the Australian Capital Territory and in some other States the full cost is borne by the government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sometimes it costs up to $12 or $14 a week for a parent to place a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a pre-school kindergarten. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have talked about the necessity for providing pre-school kindergarten facilities, but there are a good many people who urge that we ought to consider making some grant or payment to mothers of very young children,, particularly those below the age of 3 years, not to enable mothers to send their children to some <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre but to enable them to stay at home and mind their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is very important that the young <span class="highlight">child</span> should be cared for by his mother from birth to about 3. years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think a darn good case can be made out for making this possible by allowing the mother to stay at home with the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said before, I think these early mothering moments, if I may put it that way, when emotional ties are established and when the early development of the <span class="highlight">child</span> in its social setting in relation to the family is taking place, are very important indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the last 15 months this Government has had before it the report of a Senate inquiry into the welfare of mentally and physically handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a standing disgrace that 15 months after that report was tabled nothing has been done about these children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is necessary for the ordinary, normal <span class="highlight">child</span> to have pre-school education opportunities I say categorically that it is even more urgent and demanding that intellectually and physically handicapped children should have that opportunity, not only for the sake of the children but also for the mental health of their unfortunate parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should have been told that Australia can and must eliminate poverty in the midst of plenty, can and must give every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> an equal start in life by providing proper pre-schooling and raising the standards in the State and parish schools to some sort of equality with the wealthiest schools and by training the teachers we need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Endowment for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> was introduced at 50c in 1950. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My point - let any Government supporter contradict me if he can - is that only one <span class="highlight">child</span> in 11 has benefited by the marginal, minimal paltry increases that have been given over the last 20 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is a time when the Government is denying elementary justice to pensioners and to children in the form of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, when it is denying responsibility for the system of education other than paltry, arbitrary subsidies given to the wealthy private schools and a time when it is denying proper responsibility for hospitalisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A $1 a week increase in the rates of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment would have been of much more value to the families of Australia than the increase of $52 a year in the allowable deduction for each dependant of the taxpayer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The essential point is: What is the true policy of the Australian Labor Party and how will it affect every man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> in this country in the future? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to note that the Minister has seen the need to give special attention to married women wishing to re-enter the work force after having passed their most fertile <span class="highlight">child</span> bearing period so that they can come back into a work force which has changed very much from what it was 10 years earlier when they left to commence their <span class="highlight">child</span> bearing activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are major improvements also in relation to health, housing, <span class="highlight">child</span> care, social services and repatriation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This means that the civilian widow receives, including the allowance for one <span class="highlight">child</span>, a total of $28.50 and the war widow receives a total of $35.85. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that the acceptance of the principle of <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres does the Government great credit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The proposal is that working mothers will have places where their children can be properly cared for while they work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres proposal was part of a policy speech during the 1970 Senate election campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will have no time to say anything about the education or the repatriation proposals, the <span class="highlight">child</span> care proposals or the housing proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The right honourable member for Higgins  (Mr Gorton)  this afternoon was quite elated that there was a provision in this Budget for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many children will that look after? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that mothers who go to work have been most anxious and demanding that they should be allowed the cost of accommodating their children in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, $8, $10 or $12 a week - as a taxation deduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, a person with a wife and one <span class="highlight">child</span> receiving $4,000 a year will have his tax reduced by $104.15. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same is true of concessional deductions for a wife and <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to civilian widows with children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, one should keep in mind that nearly half the women on the A class widow’s pensions - that is, civilian widows with children - are deserted wives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Government has given an A class widow an increase in pension of only $1.75 a week without any increase for her children, let alone an increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, a woman could have 6 children but, under this Budget, the only increase she will receive will be $1.75 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Budget also does nothing to help the family by way of increases in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said before in this House, my electorate contains more young children than any other electorate in New South Wales, and probably, Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Couples with young families are struggling to raise their families and I know that their main demand in social welfare is an increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the only way in which mothers who wish to stay home to tend to their children can do so and not be forced to go out to work when they do not want to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why has this injustice - the refusal of the Government to update the value of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment - been perpetuated? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Budget provides $5m for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres which mainly is to be allocated to centres catering for one parent families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most children in the Australian Capital Territory can obtain pre-school education, whilst those in the various States cannot, except in a few centres run by voluntary organisations which are operating at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said before, my electorate has more children in it than any other area of the State of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pre-school education - a great necessity to fit a <span class="highlight">child</span> psychologically for the adventure of primary school - is not available to the vast majority of children in my electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the background I have given I ask the Minister responsible to provide in the Mount Druitt Housing Commission area the first <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre to be established by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I turn to <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this Budget $5m is appropriated to provide accommodation and training for specialised staff to deal with the children of low income and special need families as well as the children of working parents who must leave their <span class="highlight">child</span> ren, sometimes in the care of friends or relations or sometimes without care at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very often these children get into real trouble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My attention was directed to one gang of these children aged between 7 and 11 years who, roaming around on their own, robbed an old man who was lying on the grass of more than $100. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On another occasion, at the other end of my electorate, a similar gang of children used a shanghai to kill a prize cat in someone’s back yard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On another occasion, another gang of children speared some fowls through a fence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These children were roaming around with nothing to do and had no-one to take care of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been an increasing social problem and I look to this scheme to be of great assistance in the bringing up of these children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the family man who suffers most from increases in the cost of living, and the larger his family the more he suffers - not only financially but also in a general way, because it is a great strain and worry to him if he is unable to provide his children with the start in life to which every <span class="highlight">child</span> should be entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He could be helped by way of increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, which is real money and which is not taxable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there is assistance in regard to the education of his children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The burden of providing an adequate education for their children is a greater burden to those taxpayers in the far flung and remote areas of the Commonwealth than for families resident in the city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is quite natural, because of transport and accommodation costs which are involved when the <span class="highlight">child</span> is obliged to attend a school in the metropolitan area or in some city or town some distance from his real place of residence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth should be making specific grants to the States for the specific purpose of assisting the parents in distant places who have children who are obliged to obtain an education away from home or if the parent decides to provide the education by way of a governess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it must be remembered that before a <span class="highlight">child</span> can sit for a scholarship or attend a university he must have a solid basic teaching. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here again we have the situation where children in distant and remote areas are at a considerable disadvantage and will continue in such a situation until the Commonwealth is prepared to allocate specific amounts of money to help them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Two of the children have now left school but the woman still has one <span class="highlight">child</span> at school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Legislation was enacted in 1950 to provide endowment of 50c for the first <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The endowment of $1 for the second <span class="highlight">child</span> has remained unaltered for 24 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> care policy of this Budget is a very carefully thought out policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> care policy of this Budget entails the proposition that the community will control the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and supporting a wife and one <span class="highlight">child</span> that tax cut represents a rise of 1.56 per cent in after tax income and to a man on $15,000 a year it represents a rise of 4.9 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One last matter before I wind off is the question of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been no meaningful increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment since 1949. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the latest report of the Director-General of Social Services we find that the average number of children in each family receiving <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment is 2.18. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the first <span class="highlight">child</span> there is a payment of SOc; that has not changed since 19S0. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the .second <span class="highlight">child</span> there is a payment of $1; that has not been changed since 1950. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in 23 years of Liberal-Country Party Government there has been not le increase in the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments for the first and second children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It says: ‘Oh, yes, but the Government has put in a payment of 50c for the third <span class="highlight">child</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the report of the Commonwealth’s Director-General of Social Services says that the number of children per family endowed is 2.18. and in only one out of 12 families is money coming from the Commonwealth for the third <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been no increase in the endowment for the first and second children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the value of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment has dropped dramatically in that period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>If genuine concern had been felt, immediate taxation relief by way of tax deduction for money expended on <span class="highlight">child</span> minding in day care and family care centres would have been provided; These mothers’ efforts to maintain themselves and their families should be rewarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A fixed <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment without a means test was introduced in 1941 by a Labor government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Budget contains other very advantageous increments to the provisions for housing, health, education, <span class="highlight">child</span> care and, not the least important, death duty which will benefit the interests of family people both in the primary industry sector and otherwise to a very remarkable extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That factor helped to defeat the Chifley Government but since that time Liberal and Country Party governments have not given the same consideration to people receiving <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If, due to rising teachers’ salaries and other costs, the fees of these schools were to increase to such an extent that only the children of those on high salaries could attend them, they would indeed become the province of the wealthy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, in respect of an income of $15,000 the percentage rise in income after tax would be 4.62 per cent for a single person, 4.90 per cent for a married man with one <span class="highlight">child</span> and 5.30 per cent for a married man with 3 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The hide of him to stand in this House this afternoon and talk about the workers of Australia and his concern for their security, and to talk about the young families in Australia when all this Government is prepared to do for young families in regard to such an item as <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres is to offer them as much as it is prepared to offer the farmers to pull out trees which a few years ago it encouraged them to plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In addition I draw the attention of the House to the provisions in the Budget relating to <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, to nursing home benefits, for more hostel accommodation for elderly citizens, for young couples building their first homes and for relief from estate duties which have been unchanged for years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Children are needed and children should be given the happiness that the Prime Minister said that all Australians deserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am simply asking this House as a democratically elected body how it justifies allowing a sum of $1,200 per annum whilst it allows deductions of $364 for a wife, $208 for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> and $156 for other children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2), which is the other Bill before the House, provides, as taxpayers will be interested to learn, for an increase in tfr* deduction allowable for a spouse from $312 to $364 a year, from $208 to $260 for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 years and from $156 to $208 for other children under 16 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Up to about the $4,000 a year range everybody claims between $72 and $82 per <span class="highlight">child</span> per year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suspect the reason for that is that as people get out of the $5,000 a year bracket they tend more and more to send their children to fee paying schools and they spend more and more money on education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we go back to our $60 per week man again, we find that he claims $79 per <span class="highlight">child</span> per year, but the bloke on $10,000 to $12,000 a year claims $155 per <span class="highlight">child</span> per year, which is almost twice as much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Everybody now can deduct $260 for the first <span class="highlight">child</span>, irrespective of income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The person with one <span class="highlight">child</span> and earning $60 a week - that is, $2,800 to $3,000 a year - will receive a tax saving of $52. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The man in the $10,000 to $12,000 a year range with one <span class="highlight">child</span> will receive a tax saving of $125. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, concessional deductions for children cost the revenue SI 70m a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At that marginal rate of tax concessional deductions represented a tax saving of $41.57 for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> and $29.94 for subsequent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We could make a payment to large families where mothers have young children and are unable to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These mothers could be paid a small wage so that they could stay at home and look after their young children or, if they preferred, they could go out to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We might be able to provide selective benefits to the low income families so that their children could be sent to proper <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres, not just somewhere where the children are plonked in front of a television set all day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The father visited the <span class="highlight">child</span> regularly and returned it early in the evenings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 31st May this year he collected the <span class="highlight">child</span> as normal but, unbeknown to the mother, he took the <span class="highlight">child</span> on a Qantas flight on Maltese passport No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was able to do this because the <span class="highlight">child</span> was endorsed on his Maltese passport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have permitted a Maltese national to abduct an Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> with impunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> was not subject to any court order in Australia but, had it been, our court order would have been nullified in deference to the immigration laws of another country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of this we have the situation where an Australian <span class="highlight">child</span>, born to an Australian mother, was taken from Australia on a Maltese passport, without her consent, and she is left in Australia with her 18-month old <span class="highlight">child</span> in Malta. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they are not so loose as that, the Commonwealth has acted at least negligently in permitting the <span class="highlight">child</span> to be taken from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even in many cases where the mother has been a woman of ill fame the court still has given custody of the <span class="highlight">child</span> to the mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we find in this case, regardless of the mother’s character, the <span class="highlight">child</span> has been taken from the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister to investigate this matter and take whatever steps are necessary to have  Mrs Carbonaro  flown to Malta at the Commonwealth’s expense and to provide her with legal assistance to enable her to secure a court order in that country for the custody of the <span class="highlight">child</span> so that she may bring him back to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Australian immigration laws have no provision which will prevent a Maltese national registering a <span class="highlight">child</span> on his passport without the permission of his wife or the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s mother, that loophole should be closed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Otherwise any Maltese who took a liking to an Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> could falsify documents to prove that it was his own <span class="highlight">child</span>, go to the Maltese High Commission and have the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s name endorsed on his passport, and take him from Australia with impunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What was the estimated annual loss to Commonwealth revenue of the standard deduction from taxable income for a first <span class="highlight">child</span> of $208 and subsequent children of $156 for the latest year for which figures are available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-55-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using these statistics, it has been estimated that the loss to Commonwealth revenue from deductions allowed for the maintenance of children under 16 years of age in assessments of taxable individuals for the 1970-71 income year was approximately $l70m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-55-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This estimate takes account of the cost of all deductions for maintenance of <span class="highlight">child</span> dependants under 16 years of age allowed to taxable individuals, not only the cost in respect of children for whom the maximum deductions of $208 and $156 were allowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-55-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assuming that all taxpayers who were allowed concessional deductions of any amount in respect of dependent children under 16 years of age for the 1970-71 income year had been allowed a standard reduction in tax payable of $41.57 for each first <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 years of age and $29.94 for each other <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 years of age, the revenue loss would have been approximately $II5m <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-55-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that occasion the honourable member pointed out so rightly - I think I am quoting him correctly from memory - that a man on $55 a week with a wife and a <span class="highlight">child</span> and sometimes 2 <span class="highlight">child</span>’ ren or more- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, I am one who commends people such as the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden)  for drawing attention to the fact that the committee of inquiry, for instance, that has now been appointed to look into the whole taxation structure should have a close look at the greater equity that could and probably will toe brought about by converting dependant’s allowances into a rebate or <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We all know, or should know, about the growth of <span class="highlight">child</span> delinquency throughout our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Parliament has an obligation to reduce this shocking social evil, and what is a better way of reducing <span class="highlight">child</span> delinquincy than by the Government creating a ministry of sport? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can see nothing that would be more effective in reducing the problem of <span class="highlight">child</span> delinquency than the Parliament creating a ministry of sport and subsidising sporting bodies, particularly for the first 5 years of their existence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the shorter working week and for the purpose of reducing <span class="highlight">child</span> delinquency it would play a most important part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These related to the need for <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities at a cost to parents which would not impose hardship; vacation centres for the care of children of working mothers; the provision of a much extended system of occupational training for women whose employment has been interrupted by the raising of a family; the provision of incentives to private employers able and willing to employ women on a part time and/ or tandem basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is necessary to take the <span class="highlight">child</span> by car or train as the local doctor in most cases does not consider the use of any ambulance justified and, as in the main there are numerous conferences with the surgeon, it is not practical for the parent to return home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our attitude in this matter is based on more than a belief that every <span class="highlight">child</span> has a right to a basic level of support from governments in education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should add that it is very difficult for the parent of a <span class="highlight">child</span> at a nongovernment school to accept the argument that everyone has the right to a complete Government-provided education in a government school, but that they lose any right the moment they decide to send their children to a non-government school whether it be for religious, geographic or any other reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In future the Commonwealth will make annual per capita grants on the basis of 20 per cent of an amount assessed as the estimated average cost of educating a <span class="highlight">child</span> in government schools throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the honourable member for Reid applies the description ‘a bribe’ to the scheme, I ask him whether he considers the payment of social services, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, age and repatriation pensions and payments for education or other fields in which the Government is involved as simply bribes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Who would not be tempted to buy it as a gift for, say, an aged mother or a young <span class="highlight">child</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is not a bad <span class="highlight">child</span>, but because of the difficulties the family is having he is now in Mittagong boys home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I realise, and I think she does too, that when one of the children becomes a ward of the State it is normal for a reduction to take place, in the pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently why this woman has had her pension reduced is that the husband, who deserted her, left about a year after the first <span class="highlight">child</span> was born, and the second <span class="highlight">child</span> is the product of another relationshipcasual or otherwise, I do not know - and certainly not of the father of the first <span class="highlight">child</span>, who deserted her. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So because this woman has a second <span class="highlight">child</span> born outside wedlock, or however the Department likes to describe it, she is now being told that her pension will be reduced from $57.50 to $36. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely this woman, who already has a family, who is a mother, a housewife and a deserted wife to boot, should not be penalised in such a way on the basis that the <span class="highlight">child</span> was not of the legal marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amount up to which the computation of a pensioner’s income may be reduced for means test purposes for each dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> is to be increased by  $2  to  $6  per week <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Labor Party went out of office in 1949 <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments represented 1.5 per cent of the then gross national product. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1972, despite the fact that there is a greater proportion of children in the total population than there was in 1949, and despite the fact that we have extended the provision of endowment to student children over 16 years of age, the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment bill expressed as a proportion, of the gross national product has fallen from 1.5 per cent to 0.6 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or, to put it another way, if we were paying the same proportion of our so-called affluent resources in 1972 as we were paying in 1949, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment today would be  2i  times what it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is collecting more and more in taxes in aggregate in terms of the gross national product than it was previously but does not give priority to families by way of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> endowment in the Government’s mind is a memorial to the past rather than  a  realistic recognition of the problems of the present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If anything indicates this, it is the real proportion of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment in terms of the gross national product. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also increases the pension rates in respect of the children of deceased seamen coming under the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The weekly rate for each <span class="highlight">child</span> rises to S7.35. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where the mother is dead also, the rate rises to $14.70 for each <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Repatriation Bill, as previously explained, in the case of certain children receiving full time education, amendments are being made in respect of the continuation of their pensions until the age of 21 years is reached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the war widow is unable to work because of invalidity, is aged 50 or more or has a <span class="highlight">child</span> in her care she receives a supplementary domestic allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children’s pensions also are paid on a compensatory basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What this means is, allowing also for means tested pensions, that a war widow without children wit now receive up to $44.25 a week and a war widow with one <span class="highlight">child</span> will receive up to $63.10 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no increases in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment or in the amounts paid in respect of children of social service pensioners and civilian widow pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the Government has neglected the children because children have no votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government supporters cannot show me one direction in which the Government has done anything for the children of families, apart from the 75 cents which is granted in respect of the children of war widows, the benefits relating to orphans and a couple of little things like that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I say that children have no votes, and this entire Budget is a political Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the children of deceased servicemen, who died as a result of war service, for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> there has been an increase of 36.1 per cent and 1 am glad to see that for the second <span class="highlight">child</span> and subsequent children the increase has been 72.9 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For children who have lost the support of both parents there has been an increase over the last 3 years, the life of this Parliament, of 44.8 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I believe there are many areas of the system which ought to be expanded - for instance, the education scheme for the children of soldiers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we could look at the question of pensions applying to children of school age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The idea of cutting off a pension when a <span class="highlight">child</span> turns 16 is irrelevant in the society in which we live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were 3 important proposals in relation to repatriation allowances for children included in this year’s Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the living allowances payable to children eligible for benefits under the soldiers’ children’s education scheme will be increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, and this is a major improvement which will be available to all children whose parents receive war pensions but do not receive substantial Commonwealth assistance specifically related to the maintenance of a <span class="highlight">child</span> doing full-time education, the Repatriation Act will be amended to allow the war pensions of those children undergoing full time education to continue until the children reach  ?.l  years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these days of technological change there is an increasing need for children to undertake higher education to fit them for their future roles as citizens and anything that can be done to assist them to that end should be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such assistance is already being given by way of Commonwealth scholarships but since not every <span class="highlight">child</span> receives such a scholarship, the proposal to continue the payment of war pensions to children undergoing full-time education but not receiving other substantial Commonwealth assistance towards riving costs until they reach 21 years of age is a very commendable step forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, the war pensions payable to those children who have lost their father as a result of war service and to those who have lost their mother have been increased again so that now the former group will receive $7.35 a week and the latter group $14.70 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has now reached the stage where he wishes to bring his sister and her husband and their <span class="highlight">child</span> from England to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The irony of the situation is that had they, as a young couple, migrated to Australia without a <span class="highlight">child</span> and subsequently had a slow learning <span class="highlight">child</span>, no thought would now be given to deporting the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they had migrated to Australia while the wife was pregnant or the affected <span class="highlight">child</span> was a babe in arms no-one would have protested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are not people who will come here to swell the ranks of the unemployed or to take some opportunity of government housing assistance from another person; they are people who are assured of a home, an income, a future and a place in the sun for their <span class="highlight">child</span> who will, I am sure, grow to be a useful Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>its indifference to indefensible levels of neonatal, infant and <span class="highlight">child</span> mortality, malnutrition and disease; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who have done work on population statistics since 1966 point out the rapid rate of population increase, the high birth rate which prevails, the survival rate, which is high despite the extraordinarily high rates of those who suffer from disease and the quite indefensible levels of neonatal infant and <span class="highlight">child</span> mortality to which the amendment ls directed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a long time, for instance, at Hermannsburg Mission the Aboriginal children obtained a primary education in the Arunta tongue, and they learnt English as a second language later on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mission took the point of view that a mother tongue is the language of the heart; it is the best way to speak to a young <span class="highlight">child</span>, and I believe that in many more areas we ought to be encouraging the survival of Aboriginal languages by giving a primary education to Aboriginal children in their own tongue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>infant and <span class="highlight">child</span> mortality to the European levels’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we say boldly: ‘We will eliminate the diseases of yaws, hook worm, tuberculosis and leprosy from the Aboriginal community as well as reduce the neonatal, infant and <span class="highlight">child</span> mortality’, we will have nailed our flag to the mast; we will have adopted goals and all our expenditure and all our policies will be forced to conform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister suggests that the only reasons why people send their children to a greater public school, for instance, would be religious or geographical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should exist if parents want to send their children to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if a class has 24 students and every parent pays for each <span class="highlight">child</span> in that class $1,000 a year, the recurring revenue for that class is $24,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some of the more privileged greater public schools to paint through their classrooms, it might be an adequate sum, but for an organisation like the Catholic schools which are trying to provide aa education for the poorest parish <span class="highlight">child</span>, $700,000 a year is simply pathetic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The appropriation of money for science laboratories, important as it has been, is professionally oriented; it is for the <span class="highlight">child</span> who will become skilled in research in chemistry, physics and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely, however, the large numbers of children who leave after 3 years of high school are also still Australian citizens, but 1 do not think they come within the range of the sympathy or the interest of the last 4 Commonwealth Ministers for Education, including the present Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The school system is not adapted to the needs of the non-academic <span class="highlight">child</span> who is greatly in need of basic trade training and training in the manual arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is time the Commonwealth Government considered in both the private and the public sector a diversification of education for the nonacademic <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Church wishes to reach the working class <span class="highlight">child</span> who cannot pay high fees and also wishes to diversify its education to meet his needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore tragic that there is no equivalent appropriation being made for the development of the manual arts for the non-academic <span class="highlight">child</span> - equivalent to science grants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Give a <span class="highlight">child</span> the chance to master tools and machines and whilst you cannot give him in school the trade training that would exactly equip him for a life job, you give him sympathy for a set towards the whole subject which can be used as the basis for his later development into a highly skilled artisan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government has exercised this power in the case of Aboriginal children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a need to assist poor children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It knows how many children they have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It can ascertain from the States the number of people in receipt of <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has all this information at its disposal and it is time that there was associated with our social services structure a system of educational endowments and financial grants to enable poor parents to have assistance in meeting school uniform expenses, school fees, school books and assistance to meet all the other aspects of educational cost in which poorer children are disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been done too late at the age of 14 in the case of Aboriginal children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no reason for giving educational grants to Aboriginal children on the ground of their colour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Assume that the amount to educate a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a State school at secondary level is $600. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But unfortunately, from my observations and from the actions of the young people who sat on the grass opposite Parliament House recently partly on strike and partly I suppose because it was a nice day, children in the schools of Canberra seem to find themselves in a very restrictive system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">child</span> from a basic wage home had a much less chance of getting a good education than a <span class="highlight">child</span> from a home with greater means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no evidence anywhere that the <span class="highlight">child</span> from the home with greater means is brighter on the average than the <span class="highlight">child</span> from the working class homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, as the honourable member for Capricornia  (Dr Everingham)  has just reminded me, about 50 per cent of bright children are the children of working class people, the tradesmen, but only a relatively small proportion, perhaps onesixth or one-seventh of them, get to university. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speakers have pointed out again and again that the cost of educating a <span class="highlight">child</span> in the State sector is $600. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, it gives much more to the children in the most affluent schools than it does to those in the less affluent schools, simply because not only are they given an equal per capita grant but also very generous taxation rebates are given to parents who are able to spend $400 a year on the education of their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Supposing that a parent in receipt of a taxable income of $4,000 a year was able to spend $400 a year on the education of his or her <span class="highlight">child</span> at one of these least affluent schools, he would receive $107.20 by way of taxation rebate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that: A person with a taxable income of $4,000, under the current taxation schedule, would receive a taxation rebate of $107.20; but a person with a taxable income of $9,000 who is able to spend $400 a year on the education of his or her <span class="highlight">child</span> will receive a taxation rebate of not $107 but $171, which is 61 per cent more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you happen to be one of the very affluent people who can send their children to the very best schools - a person with a taxable income of $20,000 a year - you receive back $241 out of $400 by way of taxation rebate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the position we finish up with is that the higher the income bracket of the parents the greater the percentage of help they receive in the education of their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we accept the Government’s figure that it costs about S560 per annum to educate a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a government school, this is what will happen under this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a person with a taxable income of $4,000 spends $150  -  which is the more likely amount that he will be able to spend - that is, $50 a term for the education of his <span class="highlight">child</span>, he will receive a tax rebate of $40 and also have the benefit of the $224 which the Government is promising him under the per capita subsidy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am really putting to the House is that the person in receipt of the low income that I have cited will get back 47 per cent of what it costs to educate a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a government secondary school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the person in receipt of $20,000 will receive 83 per cent of all the costs to educate a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a government school if we accept the figure of S560. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it ought to be pretty obvious that the wealthier you are the more assistance you get from this Government to educate your <span class="highlight">child</span> in a private school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only do the rich receive that kind of assistance to send their children through secondary school but also the vast majority of Commonwealth secondary school scholarships go disproportionately to children in the most affluent schools simply because they have greater facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will be children who have a lack of environmental stimulus in their home and a lack of community environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the education of Australia’s children is a matter of national necessity and importance, and surely it must then naturally follow that the major responsibility rests not with the individual State governments but fairly and squarely upon the Commonwealth Government to ensure that every <span class="highlight">child</span>, irrespective of whether he lives in the city or in the far north, has the opportunity of gaining an education not limited by the financial circumstances of the parents, not limited by the financial resources of the State in which he lives, but limited only by his own ability to learn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government obviously does not accept that view because in all States of Australia today there are hundreds of children whose chances of gaining a good education are very remote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, it goes further than the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The parents of children in isolated areas have certain alternatives which can be boiled down to 3 choices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the Government’s proposal to change over from double side band to single side band radio the cost of replacing sets could be beyond the financial capacity of many parents, and unless some assistance is given in that regard we will see ourselves in a situation where the School of the Air will not be available to some of these children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third and certainly the best choice as far as the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s education is concerned is to send the <span class="highlight">child</span> to the metropolitan area or elsewhere where good schooling facilities and accommodation are available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Air or train fares are expensive items, particularly if the <span class="highlight">child</span> is to return home at the end of each term or during school holidays - and surely it must be in the best interests of the children if they are allowed to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One frequently hears complaints from city dwellers in relation to the cost of education, and I think they are genuine in their complaints, but how much greater must be the complaint and how much more is it justified from people in the country and outback areas as compared with the city people, and how much greater is the worry of the parents in remote areas as to the adequacy of their <span class="highlight">child</span>’s education? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, a <span class="highlight">child</span> who is born and lives in the city areas has about a 50 per cent greater chance of completing his secondary education than the <span class="highlight">child</span> who lives in one of the country areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the central suburbs of Melbourne, we find that 50 per cent of the children who began their first year of secondary education were still enrolled in 1970 for their final year of secondary education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it can be seen that children who happen to be born in the Bendigo, Maldon and Castlemaine regions of Victoria have less than half the chance of continuing on to their final secondary year of education that the children born and educated in the central suburbs of Melbourne have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking at the new Commonwealth secondary scholarships scheme, the fact that for the first time since 1965 a means test has now been introduced into this scheme is in itself a condemnation of a consistent policy of discrimination in favour of the children from more affluent families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it will not make a scrap of difference by bringing in a means test after a <span class="highlight">child</span> has sat for an examination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will not make a scrap of difference to the <span class="highlight">child</span> in the country school, the <span class="highlight">child</span> from the working class family, the <span class="highlight">child</span> from the migrant family and all those whom we regard as being in the low income section of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will not make a scrap of difference because the means test is applied through this scheme itself which has been convincingly proved over and over again to be discriminatory against a <span class="highlight">child</span> who happens to be born into a lower income family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those children will not win a scholarship now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing that caused me a bit of disappointment was that the Budget did not approve funds to assist the Isolated Childrens Parents Association, but as the Minister pointed out, by the Commonwealth Government’s action in providing financial assistance for the States to undertake educational work, which has been their special responsibility down through the years, the States should be able to assist people in remote areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel very confident that the States concerned with the problem of educating isolated children will be able to do that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am hoping that as a result of the Commonwealth assistance to the States the States will be in a position to assist the Isolated Children’s Parents Association so that parents in isolated areas will be able to provide for their children what is the birthright of every <span class="highlight">child</span>, a reasonable standard of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 have received letters suggesting that anybody who favours pre-school education favours latch-key parents and latch-key children and that it is only a question of parents wanting to evade their obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Pre-school education can be very vital in establishing a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s mental, nervous and moral stability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can also be compensatory education for under-privileged children, as anybody who has travelled through the Northern Territory and seen Aboriginal children in the pre-schools of the Northern Territory will testify. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is more, preschool education may be educationally very significant in that disabilities from which children suffer may be detected early. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Children who are dyslectic and have extremely high intelligence can conceal from their teachers for a long period the fact that they are not really reading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The existence of the pre-school system of education enables quite a lot of the disabilities of children to be detected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have endeavoured to escape from the Scylla of cramming - it is not an examination in the ordinary sense - but they have not escaped the Charybdis of the sociological and family condition of a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A <span class="highlight">child</span> with verbal manipulative skills, with a family background of developed conversation, approaches an examination which diagnoses those verbal skills with a great advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The important thing is that parents should have a choice, so that they may send their children where they believe they will acquire the values they have been taught at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The important thing is that parents have a responsibility for their children and they will not hand them over to the Government to be brought up in any old way and filled with strange views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These advertisements will appear at tremendous expense and they must appear , because the Government has told these schools that for every <span class="highlight">child</span> they have at . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For every 20 of those children, they will, be paid $4,200 and for every 30 of them, they will be paid $6,300. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The  assistance given for each <span class="highlight">child</span> to remain at non-government high schools would enable $450 to be spent at present on an equivalent <span class="highlight">child</span> at a government school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For each <span class="highlight">child</span> who is assisted to remain at a non-government primary school through assistance such as this Government is giving and through assistance such as State governments are giving - the Labor State governments are always the most pasimonious in this respect - there is between $200 and $250 available to be spent from public funds on an equivalent <span class="highlight">child</span> at a government primary school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the process there is a denial of the basic right of a <span class="highlight">child</span> to assistance merely because that <span class="highlight">child</span> goes to school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet Government supporters then say: ‘Is this not a good thing because the poor underprivileged children in those Catholic schools will be encouraged to go on in this inadequate situation and thereby save the Government money.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the worst thing for any government to suggest that it will exploit children on the basis of religious adherence and that it will thus save itself some money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be far better and more honest to say that if the children are in these schools, they should get what they need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What clause 13 means as it stands at the present moment is that for many of the very wealthy private schools this will provide another fillip by which they can increase their standards over the standards enjoyed by the children at the least wealthy private schools and those children who are attending government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Education in Australia takes place in a very competitive context, and every dollar of assistance that is provided to one school as opposed to another gives a very distinct advantage to the <span class="highlight">child</span> who goes to that school over the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us just think about how well accommodated, well staffed, well equipped and well endowed schools such as Sydney Grammar School, Melbourne Grammar School, Geelong Grammar School, Xavier College and some of the other wealthier schools are already and how well placed their children are to get the maximum benefit out of the nation’s education resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During this initial period of  6  months, assistance is  a  State matter and is also closely related to <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare responsibilities and functions which are solely  a  prerogative of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-57-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government initiative is a tangible expression of its very real and proper concern for the welfare of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the legislation is to ensure the development of <span class="highlight">child</span> day care facilities of good quality throughout the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Included in the concept good quality’ are both the physical arrangements and the professional staffing, in the provision of which the overriding consideration will be the emotional, intellectual and physical development of children in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its work has included an investigation relating to needs in <span class="highlight">child</span> care, particularly the needs of working mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its studies covered developments in the field of <span class="highlight">child</span> day care in most other industrialised countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further research programmes instigated in my Department and elsewhere subsequently indicated the parameters of the problem of <span class="highlight">child</span> day care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most importantly, they revealed that <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities had not kept pace with the rapid growth in the female labour force during the 1960s, and that, as a consequence, existing <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities were inadequate, qualitatively and quantitively, for the growing numbers of children needing them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only were there too few centres but in many cases the provision was only for <span class="highlight">child</span> minding and not for the quality of <span class="highlight">child</span> care appropriate to the educational, emotional and developmental needs of the young children involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During this examination the committee had the benefit of consultations with State government departments and with representatives from a wide range of local government, professional and voluntary groups and organisations throughout Australia concerned wilh day care arrangements for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These consultations revealed among other things, that <span class="highlight">child</span> care which was beneficial to the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s overall development was prohibitively costly for the large body of parents, and secondly, that the childminding arrangements that most parents could afford fell far short of the quality that was required in the interests of <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While many working mothers were able to make satisfactory arrangements for their children during working hours, a substantial number were not, partly because of a shortage of <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities and partly because of the cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It became evident that only through Government action could the problems that had developed in relation to <span class="highlight">child</span> care be met within an appropriate time scale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In summary, the Government decided that action was urgently needed; action to ensure sufficient good quality <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities in the community for the proper care and development of pre-school aged children whose parents or guardians are unable, for a variety of reasons, to make other suitable arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These facilities should be available at a cost that is not prohibitive to parents, especially to parents of children in special need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to acknowledge that this initiative comprehends assistance at 3 levels - that of the <span class="highlight">child</span>, of the family, and of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason there will be no static approach to the concept of <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme is forwardlooking and includes provision to stimulate research into all factors relating to the needs of the community in relation to the care of children, and for experiments in various <span class="highlight">child</span> day care methods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, it is the view of authorities concerned with <span class="highlight">child</span> care - for example the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Psychiatry Section of the Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists - that alternate care, provided for young children while their mothers are working, which is inadequate and unsatisfactory, can contribute to emotional disturbance in the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s later years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of particular concern is the situation where young children are left in the care of untrained and unsupervised <span class="highlight">child</span> minders who do not have the facilities conducive to the social and emotional development of young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, many young children are being taken care of in just such circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second, the Government’s initiative springs from its concern for the welfare of children of working mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also a fact that at present 25 per cent of mothers with children under 6 years of age are in the labour force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That a substantial number of such mothers cannot make satisfactory arrangements for the care of their preschool aged children is yet another fact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the scheme is to meet this existing problem - to help the children of working and other parents insofar as they are deprived of proper <span class="highlight">child</span> care either because good quality facilities are not available or because the cost is presently too high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In summary, the Bill provides for assistance to non-profit organisations, including local governing bodies, to establish and operate centres which provide day care for children of working and sick parents and which give priority of admission to children in special need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this purpose children in special need are defined in clause 20 of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed scheme has 4 main elements, as follows: (i) capital grants; (ii) recurrent grants in respect of qualified staff; (iii) recurrent grants with respect to children in special need; and (iv) grants for research and evaluation of matters relating to <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In summary, unmatched capital grants will be provided and made payable direct to eligible organisations for: (i) the purchase, erection, extension or alteration of buildings, including necessary fixtures, and land cost, for use as a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre; and (ii) the purchase and installation of equipment for use in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government regards unmatched grants as the most effective method of ensuring that sufficient new <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres will be built where they are needed most, particularly in areas of greatest social need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provision in the Budget of funds for capital grants in this financial year should enable a substantial expansion of the number of <span class="highlight">child</span> care places in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hoped to establish some 50 new centres catering for some 3,000 <span class="highlight">child</span> care places in the first full year of the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would provide an increase of about 20 per cent in the number of <span class="highlight">child</span> care places available in Australia, lt is a significant first step, and the Government intends that at least this rate of growth will be sustained in subsequent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For its application for an unmatched capital grant to succeed, a claimant organisation will be required to demonstrate that it is capable of efficiently managing a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre, and that it can bear the responsibility of ensuring the centre’s financial viability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all cases, the acceptance of a capital grant will automatically involve responsibility for running the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre in accordance with the required conditions which I shall deal with later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is provision for recurrent grants to eligible organisations to encourage the employment of certain types of qualified staff in specified numbers in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where there are 15 or more children 3 years of age or over enrolled full-time, the grant will be in respect of one pre-school teacher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the first 20 children 3 years of age or over, the grant will be in respect of one qualified nurse for every 20 children or part thereof. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is provision for grants in respect of additional pre-school teachers in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres accommodating more than a prescribed number of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Younger children under 3 years of age have other and more demanding needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The grant will be available for a qualified nurse employed in a centre for every 10 such children or part thereof for which the centre has enrolments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of children in this context refers to children enrolled for 8 hours during the day in a centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill includes provision for the calculation of the grant to be made in such a way as to take into account the varying hours that different children might attend centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, under the scheme opportunities will exist for children aged between 3 and 5 years in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres to receive pre-school education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, setting of standards for the employment of qualified persons in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres is a function of State or local governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for special recurrent grants to enable centres to offer reduced fees in respect of enrolled children from low income and other families in financial need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been suggestions from time to time thai attendance at <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres should be free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fees normally charged to parents of children not in financial need will bc of the order presently being charged in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For these fees, however, children will enjoy in government-assisted centres a quality of care superior to that otherwise available because of the nature of the facilities and the qualified staff provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basis of the method will be that an organisation operating a centre will receive payments with respect to children in special need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this purpose, ‘children in special need’ is defined in the Bill - Clause 12 - as children of one parent families, of families in the first 3 years of settlement in Australia, of families where one of the parents is sick or incapacitated, and of families eligible to receive assistance under the subsidised health benefits scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The level of the grant paid to organisations operating centres in respect of each <span class="highlight">child</span> in special need may be up to some $8 per week per <span class="highlight">child</span> under 3, and some $6 per week per <span class="highlight">child</span> 3 years of age and over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The maximum rate per hour of attendance per <span class="highlight">child</span> that may be paid to an organisation will be prescribed by regulation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The circumstances of families placing children in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres cannot be predicted in advance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a scheme of this nature, that relates to the development and care of children, every opportunity must be made to ensure that organisations assisted can operate their <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres with compassion and with the capacity to assist the most needy cases as they arise from time to time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, it will be the responsibility of organisations operating centres to balance their own financial budgets, taking into account the recurrent grants that will be made available - both in respect of staffing and with respect to children in special need - the fees they can collect, and their other sources of income, if any, against their outgoings for salaries, maintenance of equipment and buildings and other current expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present in Australia there are some 80 <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres operated on a nonprofit basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of these grants the scheme will come into operation when the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act receives royal assent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to provide <span class="highlight">child</span> care on such days and during such hours as the Minister determines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intention of the first of these conditions is to ensure that preference in admission is given to those in greatest need of <span class="highlight">child</span> day care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Organisations Li receipt of grants will be required to operate the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres concerned for the benefit of the community in which they are located and generally to the satisfaction of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will, of course, be obvious to honourable members that organisations seeking capital grants will have to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Minister that a need for the new or additional <span class="highlight">child</span> day care facilities exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for a <span class="highlight">child</span> care standards committee to be established to advise the Minister on the range of facilities that will be covered by the unmatched capital grants to organisations, on the standard of these facilities and on the service provided in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres in receipt of grant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In considering appropriate facilities and their standard the committee will, of course, have regard to the standards for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres required by State legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The committee may also be asked to advise on other matters referred to it in connection with the <span class="highlight">child</span> care scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> care standards committee wil! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that it will be possible to include officers of relevant State government departments who can advise on the facilities that should be provided, on the best approach to the development of children in centres, and as to the geographical areas that are in greatest need of additional <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government intends to ensure that developments in its provision for <span class="highlight">child</span> care continue to have regard to the wide variety of views that are known to exist in the community on the subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One practical application of this proposition will be studies to review how the scheme provided for in this legislation is meeting the needs of the <span class="highlight">child</span>, the family and the community, and to identify inadequacies, if any. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second expression of the Government’s concern about future developments is the provision for research to explore the very large field of <span class="highlight">child</span> care, particularly as it relates to day care, and related areas such as after-school and holi-day care for school-aged children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is uncommitted as to the eventual directions in which its assistance towards <span class="highlight">child</span> day care nay develop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One area that will inevitably attract investigation is alternative forms of <span class="highlight">child</span> day care such as family day care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also worthy of study is the motivation for mothers of young children to continue to care for their own children in their own homes rather than to enter paid employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in this regard what is the persuasive influence of appropriate family counselling on mothers of young children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another area that will need development is the form by which the evaluation of <span class="highlight">child</span> care arrangements may proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be possible to involve, say, professionally qualified social workers or sociologists experienced in the <span class="highlight">child</span> care field to work in and around the Government assisted <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another important avenue for research relates to the training of staff for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a view, for example, that new forms of training are required to meet the needs of children in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The research would need to concern itself with whether such courses might range from professional to short part-time training arrangements applicable to <span class="highlight">child</span> care personnel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is proposed that this committee be called the ‘<span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Research Committee’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The functions the Government envisages for this committee are to make recommendations regarding applications for grant; to evaluate the direction of the Government’s <span class="highlight">child</span> care scheme when requested and to advise accordingly; to recommend measures for the training of <span class="highlight">child</span> care personnel; to recommend areas for research and experimentation into important aspects of <span class="highlight">child</span> care; and to advise on the application of research findings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Children of pre school age should not be deprived of proper care and the opportunity for the fullest possible development because their parents are not looking after them at home during the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was confirmed again and again during the consultations which the committee of officers undertook during its examination of the <span class="highlight">child</span> care problem and to which I have already referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude of the working mother is that her presence in the community is a fact and that assistance with the care of her children is a pressing need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its intention is to ensure that the development of its assistance for <span class="highlight">child</span> day care is kept under close review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not the Government’s intention to help additional <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres into existence and then forget about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> care centres will be community oriented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is basic, therefore, that the physical conditions in the centres facilitate and encourage the participation and involvement of parents in the care and development of their children at the centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One responsibility of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Standards Committee will be to examine designs for centres to ensure that they incorporate physical features which parents placing their children in a centre can use as a community service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More precisely, parents will be encouraged to see the centre as a place to which they can come to discuss the development of their children with other parents, with the staff in the centre and with qualified professional people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government envisages that if a beginning can be made to turn this legislation into reality quickly, we can look forward to an increase of at least 20 per cent per annum over the next 3 years in the number of places for pre-school children that will be available in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is worth achieving while research into related developments is being evaluated, lt is very important for honourable members to appreciate that significant though the increase in physical accommodation is, of much greater importance is the provision for improving the quality of <span class="highlight">child</span> care that will be available to the community in future years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under it a scheme is being provided for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres of good quality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The quality of <span class="highlight">child</span> care is important not only to parents who, for one reason or another, choose to work, but also to all parents because in today’s mobile society, with families living apart from grandparents and other relatives, there are many who have nowhere to turn when they are ill or in need of assistance with their children during the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> care centres have to be seen in their proper perspective; they are supportive of the family unit and in extreme cases are the alternative to placing children in residential institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the number of variables involved it is not possible to assign an upper limit to the cost to governments of transporting a particular <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the latest year for which official information is available (1970-71) State governments spent $37m on providing transport services or over $13 for every <span class="highlight">child</span> attending government and non-government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Costs in respect of individual children in rural areas are likely to considerably exceed the average cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the Minister’s decision to attempt to publicise the existence of the Subsidised Health Benefits Plan through posting out notices on the scheme with <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment cheques, what measures have been planned to study the effectiveness of this move. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-38-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer  to  the honourable member’s question is as follows:  (1), (2) and (3) As indicated in the reply to question 5100 of 30th May 19.72, the posting of notices with <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment chequeswas one of a number of measures designed to further publicise the Subsidised Health BenefitsPlan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-38-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was considered that most low-income -families receiving <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment would be contacted in this way, but the lodgment of applications is a matter for action by those families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-38-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It means that unemployed people in rural areas will receive between $50 and $60 a week on work subsidised by the Government while the unemployed in the city will receive the miserable unemployment benefit of $17 plus $8 for a wife and $4.50 for a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Department of Labour and National Service has been studying and promoting from time to time particular initiatives, such as the one relating to <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, in regard to the female work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One facet of this operation has been to make available Commonwealth funds for a development which will enable the children of working mothers to be reasonably looked after, probably to be productively and constructively looked after, while their mothers are at work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that in the terms of the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres and other things it is thoroughly within the province of the Minister - not my personal problem but the problem of the unemployment of women who are available for employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, in fact, we are doing the sort of thing that was projected yesterday in this chamber in relation to <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, then clearly there are measures being taken to make it possible for women to make themselves available for various forms of work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They prepared a budget for a family of 5, comprising a husband, wife and 3 children on the minimum wage paid in Queensland - the lowest wage would be $46.80 - and this budget showed that at the end of the week, if they did not run into expenses, the family could have 50c left for luxuries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These nurses, who work mainly in maternal and <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare clinics, said that their survey showed that it was not practical for a family to try to live on one low income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, of course, comes in handy to pay the medical benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Association instances what a 2 per cent subsidy could mean to a taxpayer with a wife and one <span class="highlight">child</span> who receives a loan of $12,000 for a term of 25 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are entitled to know what is in that thesis, just as we are entitled to know what is in the report of the inter-departmental committee on the question of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Parliament has no right to be called upon to debate a Bill for an Act to deal with <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres and at the same time have withheld from it vital, crucial information prepared by a special committee which would tell us whether the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Lynch)  has introduced a Bill that coincides with the facts and whether the Bill introduced by the Minister is a Bill that should have been introduced, having regard to the findings of the inter-departmental committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have to ask ourselves why we are debating this legislation at this late stage in the life of this Parliament and why this legislation appears on the notice paper with such other Bills and statements as the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Bill, the National Urban and Regional Development Authority Bill, the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill and the statement on foreign ownership? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this Budget the Government has eroded the means test; it has increased pensions; it has increased the homes savings grant; it has made a number of concessions in its new involvement in the provision of hostels and <span class="highlight">child</span> care - you name it - and it has decreased taxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A further $5 a week remains payable for each dependent <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This new promise, and the proposals on foreign investment and <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres involve a reversal of a  3-year  process: We are now experiencing the Government’s re-Gortonisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One sees it in regard to the proposition over <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres and one sees it here again in the proposition for the establishment of a national urban and regional development authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us not be in 2 minds about the Labor Party’s intention for the Authority which will be the <span class="highlight">child</span> of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The allowance for a dependent spouse is $8 a week and for each <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 it is $4.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, taking the example of a family of 5 members with the married man getting $17 a week, the dependent spouse $8 a week, and 3 children under 16 getting $13.50 a week, the total income of that family in this day and age would be $38.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The most that a man with a dependent spouse and 3 children under 16 years of age can bring into his household would be $44.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that if a <span class="highlight">child</span> of one of these unfortunate families in these circumstances turns 16, and if the <span class="highlight">child</span> has ability and his family and the community generally want that <span class="highlight">child</span> to stay at school and perhaps go forward to university, the allowance payable for that <span class="highlight">child</span> ceases immedi ately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The particular case I raise is that of a woman who had children by a previous marriage and then further children in a de facto relationship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She receives <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare assistance but no medical subsidies, which are so essential for any person with young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If she were over 50 years of age she could qualify for a B class widow’s pension, but the ludicrous situation is that the B class pension is less than what would be paid to her in <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to capitalisation of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious by the way in which the build-up propaganda is being released from informed sources’ that these ‘informed sources’ are inferring strongly that the public - that great collective mass of all the public - will be able to capitalise <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for home purchase purposes, to pay off mortgages and possibly, if we look at the New Zealand scheme, also pay for extension and maintenance to existing homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government could not allow all those people entitled to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to capitalise it so that they could spend it on anything, let alone, housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not take much mathematical ability to work out, using last year’s figures and from the latest annual report of the Department of Social Services, what it would cost if everyone entitled to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment were to capitalise their future entitlement over a 12- monthly period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost of totally capitalised <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment entitlements to the end of last financial year would be $l,700m, yet all that the Government is proposing to expend - 1 use the word ‘all’ in a comparative sense to the $l,700m - this financial year on <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment is $256m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government was so damned miserable that it could provide no increase at all in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that if the Government has in mind any proposal to capitalise <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment it will be done on an extremely restricted basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In New Zealand the recipients of family benefits, as they are called there, who wish to capitalise <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment have to pay a penalty for doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would mean that a family with 6 children whose ages ranged from below 12 months to 5 years would pay a penalty of about $438. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>these people if there are increases of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment during the period when their children ar: entitled to regular payments of endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us assume that some sort of unusual whim struck the Government and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment was increased 50c for each <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would mean that the family of whom I have just spoken, with children whose ages ranged from under 12 months to 5 years, would’ forfeit over $2,000 for the term of these children’s entitlement to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment by capitalising at this early stage of which 1 have already spoken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We do not want bland statements in a policy speech that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment can be capitalised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At a total cost of $ 1,700m not everyone is going to be able to capitalise <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, if a mother and children leave the father in occupancy of the family home - the reason does not matter - and the house has been purchased with a deposit funded by capitalised <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment the mother and children will forfeit their equity in the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Given the fact that the supplemental income in the form of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment has been forgone, they are in a worse situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: ‘the House, while not refusing a second reading lo the Bill, is of the opinion: (a) that the Commonwealth Government should take the initiative to establish <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Centres to meet the needs of working mothers, and should do this on a basis of priorities, to give maximum advantage to a maximum number of families, rather than leave the provision of this service to the chance interest of employers and local authorities, and (b) that <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Centres should be within the province of the Department of Education and Science, and should be part of a pre-school system developed progressively throughout the nation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody would want to oppose the development of these sorts of ad hoc <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres attached to industries where the employers perhaps are enlightened enough to want them or are competing for the labour of married women and want to create this as an additional attraction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, in the words of our amendment, the Opposition feels that the Commonwealth should be taking the initiative to establish <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres to meet the needs of working mothers and should do this on a basis of priorities, instead of leaving it to the chance enlightenment of various employers or local authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rate of  a  grant payable under this section in respect of  a  <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre is an amount per quarter equal to the sum of the following amounts: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rate of a grant payable under this section in respect of a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre is an amount necessary to staff centres at standards acceptable to the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Standards Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, we want to make this <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Standards Committee really authoritative in the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that this <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Standards Committee should also meet certain requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister may establish a committee, to be known as the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Standards Committee, which shall consist of such number of members as the Minister thinks fit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister shall appoint persons with qualifications in pre-school education, pediatricians, psychologists, educationalists and <span class="highlight">child</span> psychiatrists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Standards Committee shall be appointed for 3 years and be eligible for re-appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of committees established under section 16 of this Act - which sets up various subcommittees -  which sets up various sub-committees-  shall be appointed by the Minister on the recommendation of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Standards Committee and shall hold office for a period to be iciermined by the Minister on the advice of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Standards Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have taken the trouble to specify the qualifications of the members of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Standards Committee - the professions from which they will come - whereas the proposals of the Government do not specify them, because we are very concerned about the quality of any Commonwealth action in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our view, a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre is not an industrial convenience; it is part of a national education system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation represents a Commonwealth incursion into what we regard as a field of education as well as <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here is an emerging problem - the problem of women working in industry - and the Commonwealth has to take the initiative to establish <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres where there is the greatest need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suppose somebody employing a great number of married women or a local government authority does not happen to be interested in developing <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre run by an employer or factory would not be necessarily ineligible for assistance under this legislation, but the terms of the legislation make it unlikely that any employers in fact would be prepared to comply with the criteria applying to eligibility for assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place a trust would have to be set up to run the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the second place the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre would have to be opened to children other than those of employees at the factory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third criterion, of course, is that it would have to grant priority of entry to those children in special need, ‘special need’ being defined in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government takes the view that we aim to maintain the maximum amount of local interest, community interest and interest of organisations which in many cases have dedicated themselves to this form of <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not our policy to set up a large, purely government run series of institutions for <span class="highlight">child</span> care.. That is a basic matter of difference in philosophy between us on this side of the House and the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision of <span class="highlight">child</span> day care, centres of an approved standard is a major Government initiative, and the Government is prepared to allocate significant funds to meet this end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is envisaged that in the first 3 years of this scheme at least $23m will be expended on capital and recurrent grants, and at least another Sim will be expended on grants for the purpose of research and evaluation in the area of <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed scheme is concerned with the welfare of children, with particular emphasis on the welfare of those children in special need of alternative care while their parents are working, sick or otherwise unable to care for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Lynch)  said in the second reading speech, the Bill provides a number of grants in the <span class="highlight">child</span> care area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recurrent grants are towards the salaries of staff and in respect of children in special need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recurrent grants side of the scheme provides for recurrent grants of 2 types to be paid to eligible organisations operating <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres on a non-profit basis and meeting the other conditions of the grant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One type of recurrent grant is in respect of the employment of certain qualified staff in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other type of recurrent grant is in respect of children in special need of such care, such as children of single parents, of migrants in the early settlement stages, of parents eligible for assistance under the subsidised health benefits scheme and of parents who are sick or incapacitated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The grant will be calculated according to the number of hours the children in special need are cared for in the centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The capital grants side of the scheme provides for unmatched capital grants to be paid direct to eligible organisations for, firstly, the purchase, erection, extension or alteration of buildings, including necessary fixtures and land cost, for use as a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre; and. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>secondly, the purchase and installation of equipment for use in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of capital grants is to ensure that sufficient <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities of good quality are available where they are needed most. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The research grants side of the scheme provides for the grant to be made to any person for the purposes of research in <span class="highlight">child</span> care and related matters and for the initiation and development of methods of <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main conditions of grant are that centres must be operated on a non-profit basis; that centres must accept applications for the enrolment of children in special need in priority to other children; and that centres should be operated for sufficient hours and in such a way as to meet the needs for <span class="highlight">child</span> day care in the community in which they are situated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, for children being placed in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres there is the direct advantage of better quality care and better facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hoped that the very introduction of the Government’s scheme will contribute significantly to the upgrading of standards generally in the <span class="highlight">child</span> care area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, for parents to whom <span class="highlight">child</span> care fees are a hardship there will be direct financial relief in that reduced fees will apply where they place their children in the assisted centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the Government’s intention to establish the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Standards Committee referred to in the legislation as soon  as possible after the legislation is passed by this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise again that it is directed towards the welfare of children, especially those who face disabilities which could affect their full development as individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(1) In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears - <span class="highlight">child</span> care’ means the care of pre-school aged children at  a  time or times during the day when they are not being cared for in their own homes or  in  the homes of other persons; <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre’ means a place where <span class="highlight">child</span> care is provided for only those children who are residing in their own homes; eligible organisation’ means - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>(1) The Minister may, in his discretion, on behalf of the Commonwealth, make a grant of moneys to an eligible organisation, in respect of each <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre operated by the organisation at the rate ascertained in accordance with this section. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The rate of a grant payable under this section in respect of a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre is an amount per quarter equal to the sum of the following amounts: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>if fifteen or more places at that <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre are filled on the specified day in that quarter by children of or above the age of 3 years - an amount equal to the prescribed proportion of the amount of salary or wages payable during that quarter to one teacher who is employed at that <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre and is specified by that <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre for the purposes of this paragraph; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if more than the prescribed number of places at that <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre are filled on the specified day in that quarter by children of or above the age of 3 years and the Minister, in his discretion, determines that an amount should be payable under this paragraph - an amount equal to the prescribed proportion of the amount of salary or wages payable during that quarter to so many of the teachers who are employed at that <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre as the Minister determines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition wishes to specify that members of committees established under section 16 of the Act shall be appointed by the Minister on the recommendation of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Standards Committee - which, as I have mentioned, we will ensure is a scientific and qualified body - and that they shall hold office for a period to be determined by the Minister on the advice of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Standards Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rale of a grant payable under this section in respect of a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre is an amount necessary to staff centres at standards acceptable to the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Standards Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is readily recognised in all forms of modern psychology and psychiatry that a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s early years are very important in its emotional character and personality development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This gives the Commonwealth the opportunity either to take the initiative in setting up pre-school educational facilities and <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities - and I would hope after-care school facilities as well - or to empower other organisations such as State governments to take on this type of responsibility as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately we have not the time or the opportunity in this debate to discuss whether it is such a good thing anyway for mothers to go to work, especially when a <span class="highlight">child</span> is in the first couple of years of its life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no provision in the legislation for alternative arrangements in regard to proper <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The simple fact is, of course, that some of the people who will be most needful of pre-school education and care will be mentally and physically handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party wants to see the Government at least come up with a proposal to give real power to the <span class="highlight">child</span> care standards committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Barton said that the Bill is restricted to the children of working mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, it is not so restricted at all, and alternative methods of <span class="highlight">child</span> care are not excluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well to have some theoretically perfect system in our minds, such as presumably the honourable member for Barton has in his mind, and then to proceed on this basis to set up a <span class="highlight">child</span> care standards committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am rather appalled by the idea that some universal department of education should be established forever after to have vague control over every <span class="highlight">child</span> of 3, or whatever the minimum age should be, and be their mentors rather than the control being exercised by the Department of Labour and National Service which has practical experience of the dreadful problems faced by mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister specified that these amendments, which related to the standards of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Standards Committee - the educational qualifications of its members - were worthy of respect and would be considered and could be implemented under the existing legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a Government action and, by the standards of Cobden which are probably similar to those of the honourable member for Wentworth, it is socialism if the Government does anything at all especially in relation to children in the factories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was one of his charges against Shaftesbury when Shaftesbury had some provisions about protecting children in the factories that it was socialism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we are not suggesting that every staff member at kindergartens, pre-schools and <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres should have a Ph.D. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that we desire the standards of the <span class="highlight">child</span> care committee which is to determine how these places are nin to be set by experts in the education of young children - psychiatrists and paediatricians, who I understand have medical qualifications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Barton gave the impression that the Bill is concerned only with children of working mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a Government initiative to improve and extend <span class="highlight">child</span> day care facilities for mothers who for a variety of reasons may need care for their children during the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people will have a particular need for such <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme is not confined to the children of working mothers but the emphasis is in that direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only mothers are involved in the implications of the scheme but also many fathers who for one reason or another have the responsibility of bringing up their children will welcome opportunities for the worthwhile care of their children during the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is providing a basic community service concerned with the proper care of children and the needs of the family and the community generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like my colleague the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Bury)  I reject the concept that the Commonwealth should take over the whole area of provision of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is correct and appropriate that we should provide opportunities for interested groups to build the types of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres which they see as their real need, containing the sorts of facilities that they want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I first heard about the <span class="highlight">child</span> care si-heme some time ago I had some very real misgivings about whether it should be proceeded with simply because I was tremendously concerned that the facilities should go to more than just <span class="highlight">child</span> care, that they should have a very real educative function as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very pleased to know that the Government has consulted the College of Psychiatrists on the possible effect on children who will be looked after in these facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also pleasing to know that trained nurses and educators will be present, although I am somewhat concerned that the age at which children will be allowed to attend the centres should be very closely assessed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be just a personal idio- syncracy, but I have very much in mind that a very young <span class="highlight">child</span> should remain for as long as possible with his mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not like to think of very young children having to be set aside from their mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously the relationship between mother and <span class="highlight">child</span> should be encouraged to develop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like the Government, I acknowledge that the problem does occur in which mothers of very young children in certain circumstances inevitably go out to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Barton  (Mr Reynolds)  said that the scheme had been left to chance and that in areas of great need it could be that there would be no applicants or organisations willing to run the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure the honourable member that in the very substantial sum set aside for research precisely that sort of question will be considered when viewing alternative forms of <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure he did not mean that experts as such would not be acceptable on the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Standards Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Warringah  (Mr MacKellar)  raised the question of very young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that everybody would agree that the best place for a very young <span class="highlight">child</span> is with its mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the plain fact is that in many instances the lack of high standard <span class="highlight">child</span> care is disadvantaging many young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation is designed not to take very young children away from their mothers but to provide a high standard of care for those who, for one reason or another, are denied that normal right of young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems quite absurd to me that a government which can recognise the justice of full wages during compensation for incapacity up to 26 weeks should say that once a person has suffered 26 weeks of incapacity, beyond that point he can go no further but must revert to ordinary weekly wages which, even with the amendments proposed by the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth),  will amount to only $43 a week for a single man and $54 for a man with a wife with an additional $5 a week for each <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition completely rejects the concept of a total lump sum amount in the case of death and will propose that where a widow is left with dependent children she will continue to receive the same weekly pay week by week that she would have had coming into the home had her late husband remained alive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will go on so long as she has dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As soon as she no longer has dependent children it is proposed that she should receive a weekly amount equal to 75 per cent of the amount which her husband would have earned had he remained alive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our proposal is that a widow who is left with children relying upon her should continue to receive the same weekly payment, while those children are dependent upon her, as she would have received from the breadwinner but for his accident. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>‘Dependant’ will mean a <span class="highlight">child</span> who is dependent on the mother for its education or who is not self-supporting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So, if a <span class="highlight">child</span> were going to university, its university education would not have to be interrupted just because its father was killed in an accident at work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, in addition to that, in order that the man she marne:; does not have to maintain the children of her first marriage, we would provide that weekly payments must continue to be paid in respect of each <span class="highlight">child</span> at a rate equal to not less than one-sixth of the amount which the widow would have been receiving but for her remarriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The weekly payments have been increased so that a man can get  $43,  with another  $11  for his wife and another  $5  for each <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a complete lack of passion on the part of the Government to get the underprivileged <span class="highlight">child</span> anywhere through a secondary education or to get him an opportunity at the university level and in this respect we contrast with the position in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now that the Government has entered into the field of pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres, will it allow income tax deductions for expense incurred by single mothers, widows and widowers who wish to earn their living and not be dependent on pensions and who wish to send their children to a pre-school of their choice or make their own provision for the care of those children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that with the proposed flat rate per capita subsidies to students in non-State schools together with generous taxation concessions and also a high proportion of Commonwealth senior secondary scholarships, many children of parents in upper income groups will be receiving more than 100 per cent of the equivalent costs of educating a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a government school? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The parents and the children who have, written have expressed concern that what commercial television is producing are ‘basically passive consumers who are being bombarded with advertising and dull, stupid, unimaginative, boring, repetitive and in many cases American imported cartoons and films that are 20 to 30 years old. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The allowance for all children is $350 a year regardless of any means test, and that allowance is also made to a <span class="highlight">child</span> who does not leave home but is having tuition as an isolated <span class="highlight">child</span> at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Payment will therefore be continued without regard to the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s age until either eligibility for benefit ceases or the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s studies cease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A widow with one <span class="highlight">child</span> and no property affecting will now be able, to receive income of up to $86 a week before losing her entitlement to widow’s pension, or up to $90 if her <span class="highlight">child</span> is under 6 years of age or an invalid <span class="highlight">child</span> requiring fulltime care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If she has no income affecting, a widow with one <span class="highlight">child</span> may have property to the value of $38,920, or $41,000 if her <span class="highlight">child</span> is under 6 years of age or an invalid requiring full-time care, before her entitlement to widow’s pension is extinguished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to children of service pensioners, the Bill also reflects the Government’s policy that a <span class="highlight">child</span> should continue to be recognised for service pension purposes irrespective of age, for as long as the <span class="highlight">child</span> continues to undertake full-time education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A defacto wife or widow who has lived continuously with an ex-serviceman on a bone fide domestic basis for at least 3 years preceding consideration of her status, or the member’s death, as the case may be, if she is or was wholly or partly dependent on him and any ex-nuptial <span class="highlight">child</span> of an ex-serviceman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also recognises for service pension purposes a de facto wife who has lived with an ex-serviceman on a bona fide domestic basis for at least 3 years preceding consideration of her status and any ex-nuptial <span class="highlight">child</span>, foster <span class="highlight">child</span> or ward in the custody, care and control of an ex-serviceman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has also been indicated in connection with the Repatriation Bill, whilst some de facto wives and some ex-nuptial children are recognised for war pension purposes, the Government considers the present provisions too restrictive and in need of being brought into line with the recognition now afforded such persons under other Commonwealth Acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill therefore includes, in clause 3, amendments which will recognise for war pension and associated benefits purposes any ex-nuptial <span class="highlight">child</span> of a seaman coming under the Acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other night I inquired at the motel where quite a number of us live and evidently here in the Australian Capital Territory a parent can take his <span class="highlight">child</span> to a Government pre-school kindergarten 3 mornings a week, 3 hours each morning, for a cost of only $24 per annum - less than SOc a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But having this type of amenity or facility in a capital city is very little consolation for the mother of a sick <span class="highlight">child</span> who cannot even contact another person for assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A schools and a pre-schools commission will soon be evaluating the needs of education in both the private and public sector so that genuine equality of opportunity is available to every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span>, irrespective of colour, nationality, heritage or religion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This House can make a significant contribution to rights for women by, among other things, passing legislation to provide much better adult education facilities, to establish equal pay for work of equal value, to provide for family planning clinics, to build <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres and to reform those laws which discriminate against women both socially and financially. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It seems almost trite to commence by affirming the essential difference of every <span class="highlight">child</span> and the worth of every individual student. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> of today is too often manipulated by ineffective and inefficient structures, disadvantaged by often haphazard and totally inequitable distribution of Commonwealth grants and financial assistance, misunderstood and pressured by ambitious and confused parents and de-humanised and depersonalised by hungry labour markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the task of every school to strive to develop fully the personality of the <span class="highlight">child</span>; it must assist the <span class="highlight">child</span> to develop into the sort of person who can cope with rapid and often far reaching change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, we must provide a framework whereby we encourage the <span class="highlight">child</span> to rate himself against himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The teacher must be seen, in any progressive education program, not as a fact distributor but as a guide, an encourager and an organiser of situations in which the <span class="highlight">child</span> can learn most effectively for himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my conviction, and that of my Party, that the birthright of every <span class="highlight">child</span> in a prosperous and affluent Australia is to receive an education of quality - and, in time, of equality as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would see the extension of the counselling service as underlining the concept of education in relation to the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s total experience both inside the school and out of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following an urgent request for action regarding a serious speech defect, I was informed that the <span class="highlight">child</span> could be placed on the long waiting list. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When every <span class="highlight">child</span> is able to take advantage of his full time at secondary school; when all underprivileged children are cared for; when physical education facilities are available to all students; when the dyslectic and autistic <span class="highlight">child</span> has the specialist treatment he needs; when counsellors are trained, available and appointed to our schools; when remedial treatment of children with learning difficulties is adequate; when all migrant children, with their particular language difficulties, are catered for; then, if we have an excess of financial resources, and only then, will I be happy for thousands of dollars to be poured into wealthy, elitist schools and institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This seems very much litre a policy of starving the <span class="highlight">child</span> and then in the name of humanity providing it with succour and thereafter seeking the plaudits of the crowd for a great and generous act of charity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But here 1 am already slipping under the influence of the Government’s thinking of the States as children and Canberra as the fatherhead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government wants to give equal opportunity in schooling to every <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia, it should concentrate on the primary field because it is there that the <span class="highlight">child</span> takes his first steps up the education ladder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a well known statistical fact that 20 per cent of all primary school children have some specific learning defect, whether it is an inability to learn to read or an inability to do sums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, if these children are diagnosed early enough in primary school, they can be brought into the mainstream of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remedial teachers in primary school are vitally necessary if the Government is  to  implement its proposal  to  give genuine equality of opportunity to all children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these children are diagnosed at that level of schooling they can proceed and learn as they move into the higher grades. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they are not diagnosed, it will be found that children will drop out of the educational stream because they just cannot cope with the information that is being thrust at them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of a dependant other than a widow, a wholly dependent widower or a dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> or grandchild, the Commissioner is also to have regard to the extent to which the dependant was dependent upon the deceased employee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commissioner will be required to make such a review in cases where there is a widow or wholly dependent widower and one or more dependent children or grandchildren and the widow or widower dies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other  respects,  a re-allocation of existing welfare expenditure could well be helpful - for example, from tax deductibility for dependent children to increased, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, or from the current housing component of pension requirements to an accelerated program of pensioner housing construction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second group, which is perhaps of even greater importance because so many people are involved, are the children - people under the age of 21. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These children will be able to bring into the home large incomes through unemployment benefit because there is no expense for a <span class="highlight">child</span> who is being maintained at home, as most children of 16 and 17 are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does he seriously stand in this House and say that he upholds the right for the employment of <span class="highlight">child</span> labour by sub-contractors who utilise their families, including their children, because of a gap in the arbitration laws whereby families are excluded from those laws? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition supports the policy of war pensions for student children as provided in the Bill and agrees that they should be continued until completion of the full time education of dependent children who are not receiving a maintenance, living allowance or salary from Commonwealth sources that equals or exceeds the allowance payable under the Repatriation Soldiers’ Children Education Scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Bill also provides that a <span class="highlight">child</span> of a service pensioner be recognised for service pension purposes, irrespective of age, for as long as the <span class="highlight">child</span> continues to undertake full time education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thirdly, at present some de facto wives and some ex-nuptial children are recognised under repatriation legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill, therefore, embodies proposals to recognise for war pensions and associated benefits a de facto wife or widow who has lived with an ex-serviceman on a bona fide domestic basis for at least 3 years preceding consideration of her status, or the member’s death, as the case may be, if she is or was wholly or partly dependent on him, and any ex-nuptial <span class="highlight">child</span> of an ex-serviceman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Cost benefit studies which were carried out in 1972 by Political and Economic Planning for the British Family Planning Association established that averting the birth of an unwanted <span class="highlight">child</span> saved in public health and welfare services alone $1,350 in the case of a <span class="highlight">child</span> born fourth in its family, $1,510 in the case of a <span class="highlight">child</span> born fifth in its family and $8,728 in the case of the illegitimate <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a mark of our backwardness in matters of family planning that comparable studies on the cost of unwanted children to Australia do not exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increasing frequency with which women are being aborted, unwanted children are being brought into the world and couples are marrying for no other reason than to legitimatise a pregnancy confronts Australians with a challenge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must ensure as far as possible that decisions about pregnancy are made before rather than after conception, and that every <span class="highlight">child</span> born in this country is wanted and loved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One matter which is very important - the honourable member for Casey  (Mr Mathews)  spoke about it - is unwanted children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I heard the honourable member correctly - he is not here at the moment, but he will correct me later, or other honourable members who heard him more directly will correct me if I am wrong - he seemed to attribute a great deal of the blame to single mothers for what he termed ‘unwanted children’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was referring to young girls in the community who become pregnant and have an unwanted <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another aspect is that many of these young women have a natural motherly instinct and want to keep their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that there is a growing incidence of young unmarried mothers keeping their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The single mother is taking the risk that she and the children she bears and keeps will be a less privileged family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It creates a dilemma as to whether it is proper to encourage the natural mother to keep the <span class="highlight">child</span> or whether the <span class="highlight">child</span> should be adopted by another family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Families who adopt children are screened by profes sional social welfare workers and in most cases are more adequately equipped for parenthood than the natural mother and father. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take this opportunity to speak about something on which I have not heard a word from the Government, and that is <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre is a very important area of the development of our social attitudes in our community- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I was Minister for Labour and National Service I initiated the concept of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, a concept which showed our concern for the role of women in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Treasurer I allocated a sum of money in the last Budget for the purposes of providing <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we were in government we heard a great amount from the then Opposition about <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that the study of reproduction should be an essential part of a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s schooling and should begin at an early age - not just secondary school, not even primary school, but a natural and gradually developing awareness and understanding right from pre-school days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sales tax from contraceptives is because the tax discriminates against women and their choice to bear a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pose this question to the Treasurer: Would not the cost involved in placing the pill on the pharmaceutical benefits list have better served the community, particularly that section of the community which is being discussed in this House today, if the money had been spent on more family planning clinics and <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition raised the question of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will be most desperately disappointed if this Government does not do a great deal more about <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the suspension of the sitting I was discussing the need for more <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres and the remarks made previously in the debate by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that, in considering <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, we think of them as providing a service not only to those women who work but to the whole community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my mind there is no reason why women who care for children at home should not, on occasions on which it can be justified - that would be on many occasions, I would imagine - leave the children in a properly staffed <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre so that they can do some shopping, visit an art gallery, go to the pictures or do any of the other things which many women, because they have to care for their children on a 24-hour basis, find it difficult to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I happen to be the eldest <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the philosophy upon which the Labor Party is basing its health policy the control of the natural increase of Australian children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is ironical to learn that the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  shortly proposes to double <span class="highlight">child</span> endownment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the same way, I would like to see some of this money and other money being used to establish <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres and for the expansion of such organisations as the Mothers and Babies Health Association Incorporated of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would get value from expenditure on family planning, counselling advice and <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, the position is that the protection of the foetus is subject to financial penalty, quite apart from the cost of rearing a <span class="highlight">child</span>, while prevention of conception and, therefore, prevention of the natural increase of Australian born children is subsidised by the taxpayer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think women, or even men, in our society have any more right to tell other women that they should have children than they have to tell them that they should not have children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I strongly objected to the proposition which was current in this country and which certainly was current in places such as pre-war Germany where the state itself encouraged women to have children and where it insisted that it was in the national interest for them to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In countries such as Germany women were told that they should have children for the sake of the state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This type of thinking comes into exactly the same category as telling women to have children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is purely a personal matter for a woman to decide whether she is to have a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only last year I read in a document available to honourable members in the Parliamentary Library of a survey which was conducted by Swedish authorities into the cause of <span class="highlight">child</span> delinquency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Swedish research into <span class="highlight">child</span> delinquency showed that 80 per cent of <span class="highlight">child</span> delinquents in Sweden had been unwanted babies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know from experience in my previous calling that a tremendous number of delinquents who ultimately become professional criminals come from large families and in all probability were unwanted children who did not receive warmth or affection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that whilst this measure will be of great benefit at this time in our history I certainly would not like to see a decline in the family unit in Australia because I believe that the family unit, with devoted parents showing proper and true affection to the number of children that they want, is the richest asset any country can possess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My experience is that married couples who are childless, perhaps through no fault of their own, sometimes develop a form of selfishness and are more concerned with leading a poodle along the street than showing affection to young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many women in our society suffer mental disturbances or breakdowns because they cannot have a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Queensland an additional $866,000 is to be expended, partly as follows: $60,000 on food assistance for children under 6 years; $250,000 for <span class="highlight">child</span> health clinic at Bamaga; $240,000 for water supply and sewerage works at 5 places in Queensland; and $1.55,000 for hospital facilities at Normanton. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree that there must be an association in the mind of a young <span class="highlight">child</span> with the family situation and the transition which all children have to undertake from a purely family situation to one of the wider community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that provided a <span class="highlight">child</span> did not consume more than 840 millirads of iodine 131 per year in its milk its health would not be endangered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tests were taken in 9 major population centres, covering about 75 per cent of the total Australian population, following the French tests, and the results indicated that the radiation doses to thyroids of young children consuming fresh cow’s milk ranged from 4 to 62 millirads per year, and this is, of course, well below the safety limits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of principle and causes concern to the parents whom it affects, lt is a case where country parents are disadvantaged by our <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A family of 3 children with the eldest a spastic <span class="highlight">child</span> receives only $18 per quarter instead of $36, which is the normal amount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason that this happens to the country parents is that the spastic <span class="highlight">child</span> has to be boarded at a registered spastic centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Normally $6 for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> is allocated for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second <span class="highlight">child</span> is then classified as the first <span class="highlight">child</span> and the third <span class="highlight">child</span> is classified as the second <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>City parents who take their spastic children to the spastic centre daily receive the full $36 per quarter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely parents in the country who have 3 children are entitled to be recognised as such and should receive the same payment of $36 as do city parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The cost of boarding a <span class="highlight">child</span> at a centre is borne by the country parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, if the children in those families were admitted to State care, the cost to the State would be $60 per <span class="highlight">child</span> per week, minimum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Other matters provided for in the Bill are minor amendments to: Re-draft the definition of ‘<span class="highlight">child</span>’ in section 83 to clarify the intention that a <span class="highlight">child</span> who has attained the age of 16 years must be undertaking full-time education and be wholly or substantially dependent upon the pensioner parent before being recognised for Service pension purposes; authorise the extension of benefits under the repatriation regulations to student children over the age of 21 years - Parliament has given its approval in the Repatriation Act 1973 to the recognition of these children in the Repatriation Act itself and this amendment will enable the relevant provisions of the repatriation regulations to be extended to them; and apply to the principal Act new drafting principles which are being introduced by the Parliamentary Counsel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education program was mounted in April 1970 with the intention of providing special English instruction to enable migrant children with English language difficulties to achieve a sufficient command of English for them to join fully in normal classroom activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Altogether throughout Australia there are now over 1,000 teachers giving special instruction to more than 37,000 migrant children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Child</span> Migrant Education Program, as I have said, provides teachers, equipment and materials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a consequence, far too few migrant children are receiving sufficient help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Migrant Education Program must be reviewed including the earlier decision to make the provision of classroom accommodation for migrant children the sole financial responsibility of State and independent authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> migrant education must always remain a co-operative venture between the Australian Government and state and independent education authorities However, I believe that the Australian Government can and must assume a greater financial role in this venture especially in providing assistance to state and private authorities to overcome accommodation problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To achieve this and to prevent many migrant children from growing up to become secondclass citizens, I propose to consult my colleague, the Minister for Immigration, on ways and means of reviewing the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Migrant Education Program in conjunction with State and independent school authorities, so that it will fully meet the needs of migrant children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will know and the House will know that the survey of <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education was initiated by the previous Minister for Immigration and myself because we were concerned about many of the problems that had been revealed in the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think he also knows that the departmental officers conducting the survey had an open hand in pointing to the deficiencies and the shortcomings of the program that had been initiated which, the Minister said, now involves over 1,000 teachers and  37  000 migrant children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever the outcome - and all the omens seem favourable - I wanted to tell you tonight how grateful I shall always be for your encouragement and guidance, your self-effacing generosity in giving prominence to me - as with the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Endowment and Housing Bills - when it would have been entirely appropriate for you to have occupied the centre of the stage, and my appreciation for all the years of warm friendship between us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope very shortly to introduce into this House a Bill aimed at this problem of helping the young married couples particularly in respect of housing difficulties which they must face on the birth of the first <span class="highlight">child</span> which prevents the continuance of the earning of 2 incomes in the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Government will not look on it purely as something with which it can score political points but instead as something that it can support because this problem faced by young married couples of financing their house in difficult circumstances which can be aggravated by the birth of the first <span class="highlight">child</span> is one which the Australian people as a whole have to face. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Reading is a complex cognitive process requiring visual, auditory and motor skills to enable a <span class="highlight">child</span> to recognise words and symbols, to associate them with the appropriate sounds and to invest them with meaning derived from previous experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a <span class="highlight">child</span> has not fully developed one or more of these abilities he is likely to be unusually slow in learning to read. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same term also applies to children who have severe reading retardation and have never been competent readers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been found that dyslexia has no common symptoms because some children who have all the characteristic features of dyslexia are in fact good readers while others who read badly have no such signs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this to be a workable project there would have to be an assessment of the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s reading skills and an examination of the functions that underline them - visual and auditory perception, association processes, language development and visuo-motor skills such as handwriting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is necessary that a <span class="highlight">child</span> with specific learning difficulties be identified as early as possible so that remedial measures can be begun without delay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that a <span class="highlight">child</span> with specific reading difficulties will not have his intelligence based solely on this, 2 assessments must be made, one for reading attainment, the other for general ability, the results of which can be compared to reveal inconsistent performance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But to confine one’s thinking to this single absolutist principle is to ignore the many other rights inherent in the situation, such as the rights to health and welfare of the mother and her existing family, the rights to choose whether to bear children or not and the right of the <span class="highlight">child</span> to be wanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a matter of concern in an age of advanced technology and achievement where modern medicine has accomplished such wonders in curative and preventative control of disease and illness, that the best we can do as a society for the expectant mother and her <span class="highlight">child</span> is to bring the force of that technology and medical achievement to destroy human life in the womb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are a number of disastrous consequences arising from legalising the slaying of unborn children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The more developed the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> the more certain laboratories seek the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s body for experiment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am currently trying to speed the development of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Northern Territory these can mean the saving of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">child</span> life, for children in such centres are seen by infant welfare sisters and, as a consequence, their health problems are treated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Otherwise Aboriginal neo-natal infant and <span class="highlight">child</span> mortality is as much as 10 times that of Europeans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recently  Mr Bob  Hawke on television said that the whole of the French trade was not worth the life of one Australian unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole of the French trade is worth $197m, so  Mr Bob  Hawke has certainly valued - and I think very rightly - every unborn Australian as a royal soul and I cannot imagine that anybody could justify the destruction of children of that value nor justify their use in experiments where they are regarded merely as human tissue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We need a major effort to reduce Aboriginal neo-natal infant and <span class="highlight">child</span> mortality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We need realistic assistance for unmarried mothers - not merely the assistance of social security payments but advice about their children, advice about employment, advice about <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, advice about the education of their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We need the development of community services to help the <span class="highlight">child</span> who is battered or harmed in unsatisfactory homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, we need a total program on the sanctity of <span class="highlight">child</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a tragedy, I think, that our attention is being diverted to how children can be eliminated when the attention of this Parliament is very much needed to how they can be advanced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is nothing in the Bill to say that a doctor, faced with a request from a girl of say 12, 13 or 14, need consult the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can see no provision for the father of the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> to exercise his responsibilities or his rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the father is denied any legal right in determining the fate of the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is at least one other life involved - that of the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know there is a lot of argument about the point at which an unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> becomes a person in the legal sense, but my own view is that when we are considering abortion we cannot leave out of that consideration the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>, no matter what stage of development it has reached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see the fundamental right as that which has been described as the right to life of the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look for some legal guidance on the status of the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>, we find that in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1971, in the case of Watt v. Rama, it was held that where a <span class="highlight">child</span> had suffered injuries in an accident or had suffered grave disabilities as the result of her mother’s injury, the defendant had owed a duty of care not to cause injury to the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> in this case was bom on 4th January 1968 and the motor accident in which the injuries were suffered occurred on 15th May 1967  -  almost 8 months before the <span class="highlight">child</span> was born. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that the court had no doubt that this <span class="highlight">child</span> - although only a matter of a few weeks past conception at the time of the accident - certainly had the legal rights of other members of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think all of us would agree that there are circumstances in which the judgment has to be made as to whether first consideration must be given to the life, or health of the mother or that of the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However the flexibility of the present legal system in Canberra would permit a gynaecologist, after consideration of these and other factors, and after proper consultation,  to  terminate pregnancy when he considered it to be in the best interests of a woman and her potential <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me  that  there is a real question to be dealt with here - whether the right to life of the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> can be subordinated to the quality of life of the existing family or the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, we are told that there are many children born who are unwanted and because they are unwanted they suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that if a <span class="highlight">child</span> is not going to be wanted, there is a very heavy responsibility resting on those who have the power to set the life process in train to take steps to prevent conception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must ask ourselves whether the attitude represented by this Bill could lead to a lessening respect for life not only of the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> but also of people who have far less potential for usefulness in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should we not be seeing to it that mothers of young children are given the help they need in caring for them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should we not examine our attitudes, both as individuals and as a community, to the unmarried mother, to the illegitimate <span class="highlight">child</span> and to the deserted wife? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the courses open to women who carry through unwanted pregnancies and what are the consequences of each course for the mother and for the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will not begin to reduce the frequency with which women are aborted until we establish clearly in the public mind that there is a connection between abortion and the inadequacy of arrangements under which sex education is provided in our schools; between abortion and our shortage of family planning clinics, pregnancy support agencies and adoption agencies; and between abortion and our tradition of treating as outcasts from society the unmarried mother and her <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it because of poverty, because they are not married and a <span class="highlight">child</span> would cause them embarrassments or because they are married and have too many children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, what are the courses open to women who carry through unwanted pregnancies and what are the consequences of each course for the mother and for the <span class="highlight">child</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The woman may be married or unmarried, but she keeps the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She could have the <span class="highlight">child</span> adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does she forever afterwards feel a sense of guilt that she has not kept the <span class="highlight">child</span> or is she quite happy about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Supposing the <span class="highlight">child</span> happens to be a <span class="highlight">child</span> of mixed race and nobody wants to adopt it and it goes into an institution and the mother has to think of what happens to an unloved <span class="highlight">child</span> in an institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we going to pass a Bill dealing purely with abortion and not consider all these related subjects which might induce a girl to keep or not to keep her <span class="highlight">child</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If she is forced to carry the <span class="highlight">child</span> because of some specious argument that it can be adopted out, what sort of penalty is that to impose on her, that she has to carry this foetus, to use a word, until it becomes viable and is born and then give it to someone else? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Essentially that amounts to balancing the health or life of the mother against that of the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An additional reason why I would not want by my vote to pass this Bill is that I would not want to contribute to a situation in which young men and women may take a decision which could haunt them with guilt for the rest of their lives when a chance event brought back to their recollection the decision which they took many years ago and which deprived them of the opportunity of a <span class="highlight">child</span> - stifled a life at a time when there were on them great pressures which they could not withstand at the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My attitude is consistent when carried through to capital punishment, sex education, access to professional social welfare workers, <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, community assistance programs and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus unborn children have been recognised as acquiring rights or interests by way of inheritance or other devolution of property, but the existence of these rights is contingent upon the <span class="highlight">child</span> being born alive; that is, these rights are retrospective rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only justification offered for this claim is that the development of a foetus from conception through birth into childhood and thence to adulthood is continuous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our society recognises that there is a difference between the foetus, the young <span class="highlight">child</span> and the adult human being. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I submit that the fundamental issue in this debate is whether an unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> has a right to life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I contend that the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> has that right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under the law at present the life of a mother is given preference over the life of an unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While thelaw provides for protection of a mother’s life, under these circumstances the rights of an unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> normally would still remain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That an unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> has rights is widely recognised despite comments that have been made in the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the fundamental question before the House is whether the rights of an unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> should be recognised during the whole or only part of a pregnancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that an unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> is at an advanced stage at the period suggested in the Bill as the time when the rights of the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> are acknowledged by the honourable members who are proposing the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The issue is generally described as abortion on demand, or, in other words, where an abortion for any reason is made legal on request without any regard to the rights of the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> is worthy of the same protection the law gives to the infant after birth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some of the statements that have been  ma:e  about the rights of the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> appear in the Declaration of the Rights of a <span class="highlight">Child</span>, United Nations General Assembly, 20th November 1959, which reads: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, for the information of the House, in view of the great interest that there has been in this matter of dual citizenship, I think I should let the House and the honourable member know that article 4 of the Yugoslav Citizenship Law Act of 1964 provides for Yugoslav citizenship to be acquired by a <span class="highlight">child</span> on 3 bases: If both parents are Yugoslav citizens at the moment of the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s birth; if one parent at the moment of the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s birth is a Yugoslav citizen, and the <span class="highlight">child</span> is born in Yugoslavia; or if one parent at the moment of the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s birth is a Yugoslav citizen, the other parent without a citizenship, and the <span class="highlight">child</span> is born in a foreign country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such social institutions must set out to avoid mistakes of other large housing projects and must include very basic human amenities such as corner shops, shopping centres, transport nodes and <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. to care for the children of working mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the promise of pre-school education for every <span class="highlight">child</span> aged over 4 years, one of the Association’s long sought after goals has been achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As there is a changing emphasis, however, to the 3 and 4-year-olds its aim will continue to be to ensure that pre-school education to higher standards is available to all children in the wider age group of 3 to 5 years and, in addition, to be a leader in the field in Queensland in the area of full-day <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the age when a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s character is formed and his ideals moulded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, will he accept my assurance - I am sure that I speak for all honourable members who, out of a strong conviction on the basic principles involved, voted against the Bill and the amendment - that the House will co-operate to the fullest possible extent in helping the Government expedite the development of measures such as family planning clinics, <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres and education programs which will make an important and constructive contribution to the solving of the serious personal problems which abortion raises for many people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As always, it is the <span class="highlight">child</span> who bears the brunt of shortcomings in the public sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Parents with well-based fears of disease are denying their families access to the creeks and rivers which once played such an important part in the experience of an Australian childhood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem that the Association poses to the Minister - I will try to make this as brief as possible - is that in order to adopt a war orphan from Vietnam, a <span class="highlight">child</span> of varied race, which the members of the Association wish -o do, they have to apply for adoption by proxy through a Vietnamese lawyer once the children have been located for adoption purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At some subsequent stage they are :hen in a position perhaps to bring a <span class="highlight">child</span> to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They wish to ask the Minister 2 questions: Firstly, if the children are under 2 years of age and if they come in as a group, will the Commonwealth bear the cost of the fare of an escort to look after them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, would these children be eligible to enter Australia on an assisted passage? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They then go on to point out that the United States Government has an agreement with the Vietnamese Government whereby a release form is sent to Vietnam and the <span class="highlight">child</span> can then leave for its new home within 6 weeks of its being located, during Which time the legal adoption process is conducted and completed in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My information is that it costs $25 a month while the <span class="highlight">child</span> is being cared for in Vietnam, and that it takes sometimes 8 to 9 months to complete, the proxy adoption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to reply to the honourable member very specifically on one point, namely, that the Department of Immigration of the Australian Government is advised in the basic principle relating to this matter by the various State Departments of <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The biggest problem faced by these families, or at least the individuals, who wish to adopt the children, the dispossessed, the orphans of Vietnam is to validate the adoption through the State authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first instance, these children must be adopted according to Vietnamese law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the various State departments approve the adoption and when proper clearance has been secured  I  will give every support - I want to pledge my co-operation in this - to getting the <span class="highlight">child</span> united with its parents of adoption in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remaining proposals in the Bill are a result of the introduction by the Commonwealth of schemes to assist with the education of children living in isolated areas and for the payment of a domiciliary nursing care benefit to persons taking care of invalid aged relations in their homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments proposed in relation to the isolated children’s education scheme will ensure that allowances paid under the scheme will receive the same exemption from income tax as payments under the Commonwealth secondary and technical scholarship schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like the scholarship schemes, however, amounts payable for the maintenance or accommodation of isolated children are to be taken into account for the purposes of the concessional deductions for maintenance of dependants, while allowances paid in respect of education costs are to be taken into account in calculating the concessional deduction for a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s education expenses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No less than 85 per cent of the family homes to be built by State housing authorities with our advances will be allocated to families where the average gross weekly income of the main bread-winner - exclusive of any overtime and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments - does not exceed 85 per cent of average weekly earnings per employed male unit as defined in the Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where the family includes more than 2 children, this will be increased by $2 per week for each <span class="highlight">child</span> beyond the second. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In line with our policy of ensuring that our housing advances for welfare purposes benefit the more needy, applicants eligible to receive home builders’ account advances will be families consisting of a married or engaged couple, or a single parent or guardian with one or more children, where the average gross weekly income of the main breadwinner, inclusive of overtime but excluding <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments, does not exceed about 93 per cent of average weekly earnings, plus $2 a week for each <span class="highlight">child</span> beyond the second. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all realise that even though recommendations are known to be possible of implementation at a future time, sometimes the actual availability to the <span class="highlight">child</span> being educated at the school is dependent upon some money being available during the planning stages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that in some of the areas the State authorities will themselves be prepared to commit their own money to ensure that the planning takes place so that ‘the money available for 1974 can quicklly be converted into facilities available for the education of the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are many areas in which, if money were immediately available, additional educational facilities could be provided for children in schools where there is now a considerable need for improvement of facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the Bill did not provide for, say, a 13-year-old <span class="highlight">child</span> who is pregnant to have reference to her parents before an abortion is carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though, as a liberal, one could get oneself to the view that a woman has every right to do with her body as she pleases - that could be a liberal view - once one overcomes, if one can, the hurdle that a foetus has a right to life, I was finally persuaded by a report by  Dr and Mrs Wynn  who had some evidence that once a woman had had 3 or 4 abortions and then decided to have a <span class="highlight">child</span> the chances of that <span class="highlight">child</span> suffering some serious pre-natal or perinatal handicap were increased considerably. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a liberal who cares for human beings, if this evidence is right and I do not know whether it is, I must be concerned that there is a possibility, where there is abortion on request or demand, of a <span class="highlight">child</span> being born seriously handicapped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The classes of women to whom the new benefit will be payable under this Bill are (a) unmarried mothers, including deserted de facto wives and de facto wives of prisoners; and (b) married women not living with their husbands (deserting wives) or wives who have been separated for various other reasons, provided that the women be living with, and have the custody, care and control of a <span class="highlight">child</span> (or children) of whom they are the mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These women are those who are not at present eligible for a widow’s pension under the Social Services Act and who, with their children, have been subject to discrimination in the level of assistance available to them in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new benefit will become payable 6 months after the date of the event which gives rise to eligibility - for example, the birth of a <span class="highlight">child</span> or separation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Returning now to the Bill, the rate of supporting mother’s benefit will be the same as the rate of class ‘A’ widow’s pension, including mother’s allowance, additional pension for children and, where applicable, supplementary assistance for those mothers who are paying rent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that these rates in weekly amounts are: pensions, $21.50; mother’s allowance, $4, or $6 if the <span class="highlight">child</span> is under 6 or an invalid; additional pension, $4.50 for each <span class="highlight">child</span>; and supplementary assistance, $4. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The means test and other conditions for payment will be broadly the same as those applying to class ‘A’ widow pensioners; for example, the residence qualifications will be the same and it will also be a responsibility of the supporting mother to seek maintenance from the father of the <span class="highlight">child</span> if, in the circumstances of her case, it would be reasonable to expect her to do this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that in Tasmania a deserted de facto wife of 12 months’ standing may sue for maintenance for herself and children, but in the other States she may claim maintenance for children only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A word about children: The Government believes that when a mother gives birth to a <span class="highlight">child</span> she should not be discriminated against merely because conception may have occurred after she became a widow or after she became separated from her husband. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In future, both for widow’s pension purposes and for supporting mother’s benefit, a widow’s own <span class="highlight">child</span> or a supporting mother’s own <span class="highlight">child</span> will qualify them for the respective pension or benefit, irrespective or whether their <span class="highlight">child</span> was conceived before or after the date of widowhood, desertion or separation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill therefore amends the old definition of ‘<span class="highlight">child</span>’ which has remained in the legislation since 1942 and introduces a new definition, which defines a ‘<span class="highlight">child</span>’ as any <span class="highlight">child</span> born of the mother or a <span class="highlight">child</span> of whom she had the care prior to the date on which she became a widow or a supporting mother, including a <span class="highlight">child</span> who was an adopted <span class="highlight">child</span> at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further advance made by the Bill is that the additional pension of $4.50 a week for children will be payable for all other children in the care of the widow or supporting mother, whether those other children are qualifying children or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A deduction of $6 a week for each dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> will continue to be made from the widow’s income and will also be made from the supporting mother’s income before the means test is applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, in effect, gaves a class ‘A’ widow or supporting mother with one <span class="highlight">child</span> a permissible income of $26 a week plus a further $6 for each other <span class="highlight">child</span> dependent on her. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">child</span> will also be accepted as being in the custody, care and control of a widow or supporting mother where that <span class="highlight">child</span> is not living with the widow - for example, where it is living away from home to attend school, provided the widow is making a reasonable contribution towards the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s maintenance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill amends the Commonwealth Teaching Service Act in 5 ways: It makes provision for special superannuation arrangements for New South Wales and South Australian teachers now teaching in Commonwealth schools; it provides benefits by way of book and equipment allowance to Commonwealth Teaching Service scholars; it provides benefits by way of special financial assistance for Commonwealth Teaching Service scholars; it repeals existing provisions for officers absent from duty in relation to <span class="highlight">child</span> birth; and it enables the Commissioner to provide, and the authorities to use, members of the Commonwealth Teaching Service for special educational duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Clause 13 of the Bill removes as far as possible the distinction between children born in wedlock and those born out of wedlock by substituting a new Part I in the Schedule to replace the existing Parts I and II, which deal with legitimate and illegitimate children respectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The consent of a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s father who is not married to the mother will now be required where the father is living with the mother, and in cases where the parents are separated and the minor is living with him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that, in addition to ending the legislative distinction between children born in and out of wedlock for the purpose of consent to marry, the new table will be more in keeping generally with modern requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second, and a deeply disturbing one, is that removing the requirement of parental consent would have the effect of undermining parental authority still further; and even of encouraging bad parents to wash their hands of their children at the first signs of teenage trouble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Good parents do not cease to be such when the sun rises on a 21st birthday; indeed their continuing care and concern is confidently gambled upon by the government when it requires a financial contribution to a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s further and further education even up to the age of 25. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to refer to a case in my electorate of a very young unmarried Aborigine who now has given birth to her eighth <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I rise to support this legislation because of my concern about the need to provide adequate benefits to the children who, in other contexts, are sometimes described as fatherless children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The young mother, in the circumstances under which this Bill will provide a benefit, has had difficult choices to make as to how she would care for her children and give that <span class="highlight">child</span> the proper mothering it deserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should she go out to work in a full time capacity or should she stay at home and live under extreme financial difficulties in order to provide the mother care that she thought her <span class="highlight">child</span> deserved? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the first <span class="highlight">child</span> arrives the young mother is faced with an extraordinarily difficult choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should she continue to work to provide her husband and her <span class="highlight">child</span> with the financial resources that 2 incomes will bring into the household or should she stop working and provide mother care to her <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I support this legislation for what it will do for the children of fatherless families, I do urge the Government to look into the establishment of a far more comprehensive family benefits scheme whereby young mothers with very young children can, in effect, be paid to be at home providing the care that they wish to give to their children so that, instead of the community having to pay for substitute mothers, the natural mother of the <span class="highlight">child</span> can provide care at home, certainly during the infant and pre-school days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will find that by tackling in a piecemeal fashion the problems concerning the provision of benefits for children we will impose great pressures on the normal family in the community and that by putting those pressures on that family we will cause greater difficulties in the future because of the inability of the normal family to face the financial burdens that are imposed upon it when the first and second children come along and the mother chooses to stay at home and care for those children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We now have a situation where a widow or a person in receipt of this supporting mothers benefit will receive an income considerably more in excess of the acknowledged poverty levels than similar 2-parent single income families with dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 believe that we need to review our assessment of the period of dependency of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have thought in the past that a <span class="highlight">child</span> is dependent for a period of 16 years and we have tended to adjust all our benefits on the basis that having started at birth they should continue throughout that period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we need to look at them in a more sensible fashion and to adjust the benefits at levels according to the needs of the families to enable them to spread their earning capacity in a way which permits them to provide their children with a reasonable standard of living at all stages of the family’s development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do want to place on record today the need for us to examine the deserving demand of the families of the nation in order to place them in a position where they too can have financial benefits to provide their children with the home care and mother care which are so essential to their educational development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the councils want to establish a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre, a senior citizens centre, a swimming pool or a park, who decides it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer particularly to the young married couples and especially to the position of young married couples on the birth of the first <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But honourable members will realise that because of many causes - and I do not want to say that these are good or bad, but simply to record what has happened - over recent decades the position of the young married couple with a <span class="highlight">child</span> has deteriorated in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to suggest for one moment that we should tolerate economic circumstances in which a wife with a young <span class="highlight">child</span> is compelled against her will to take paid employment away from the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, parents might well buy them for their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If parents decided to invest on behalf of their <span class="highlight">child</span> $100 every year from birth, at the age of 22 or 23 years that <span class="highlight">child</span> would be able to buy a house absolutely, without putting up any other money or having any debt on the house, because the value of the certificates would have thus accumulated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that the parent would not get an income tax deduction in respect of those purchases because the income tax deduction could be taken out only in the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s name. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But by a comparatively modest investment yearly a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s future could be assured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the wage system is insensitive to family size, how then do we equalise the burden of <span class="highlight">child</span> rearing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How do we equalise the opportunity of the children being reared? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that we take steps to ensure that the standard of living of a man with children compares favourably, or at least not intolerably badly, with that of a single man or a single woman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important also that we take steps to ensure that the standard of a living of a 2 parent family where, the mother, iu the interests of her children, stays at home to care for them, compares favourably with such a family where the mother, due to the age of her children, feels that she can go out to work without prejudice to their welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we fail to do this we will attain a situation which puts pressure on the young mother who wishes in the interests of her <span class="highlight">child</span> to remain at home, forcing her out to work for economic reasons and economic reasons alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For each of them her <span class="highlight">child</span> now was past the baby stage yet still under school age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She felt guilty as to whether she was doing the right thing by her <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She also justified her decision to take full time employment on the ground that when the <span class="highlight">child</span> was going to school the <span class="highlight">child</span> would have greater opportunities available to it because of the economic resources then available to the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A friend of hers with whom I was also speaking had a <span class="highlight">child</span> of the same age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That young mother had decided in the interests of her <span class="highlight">child</span> to stay at home and not take employment until the <span class="highlight">child</span> was at least of school age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She and her husband prior to the birth of the <span class="highlight">child</span> had both been working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She felt that the best interests of her <span class="highlight">child</span> would be served by her staying at home and she had decided to do this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One mother was continuously concerned about whether, in the light of her own maternal instinct and in the light of expert information about the importance of a mother’s providing mother care for her <span class="highlight">child</span> at home, she was doing the right thing in providing substitute mothering in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres and leaving her <span class="highlight">child</span> for the long periods that were necessary if she were to retain her full time employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But she, having decided to stay at home to look after her <span class="highlight">child</span>, did not have that opportunity because the financial resources were not available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As more and more young mothers feel that the economic pressures upon them are such that against their better judgment they must go out to work even when their young children need them at home, more and more young mothers will do so because the contrasts between the 2 alternatives of being a 2 income family and a single income one will be so marked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need to tackle the question afresh and not to assume that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment over the period from birth to the age of 16 or throughout dependency is necessarily the right answer whereby we can achieve equal opportunities for the children of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time they want to do the best for their children, and they cannot do the best for their children if one of the heaviest burdens upon them is the burden of maintaining the home within which they wish to bring up their young families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the councils want to establish a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre,  a  senior citizens centre,  a  swimming pool or a park … the Commonwealth Minister, on the advice of the Grants Commission, will now decide it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this affluent and successful country Australians are entitled not only to adequate roads, water and drainage and sewerage but also to libraries, recreation facilities, community centres, <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres and cultural centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Comparatively, the western suburbs are deprived in that they lack a great number of community services such as roads, libraries, <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, recreational centres and social welfare services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill also makes provision for an officer or employee who is the father or a person accepting responsibility for the care and maintenance of the <span class="highlight">child</span> to take up to  1  week’s leave, with pay, around the time of the birth of a <span class="highlight">child</span> where he requires the leave to take care of the mother of a <span class="highlight">child</span> or of a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government, therefore, is introducing the new benefits and leave entitlements in respect of its own female officers and employees - I suppose it is not necessary to say ‘female’ officers - to enable each person concerned to fulfil the role of mother and, if she wishes, to continue her career after the birth of her <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The provision in this Bill for up to one week’s leave for the father or other person responsible should help that person meet the increased domestic responsibilities that arise at the time of the birth of a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This would mean that that man who became the legal father or custodian or one responsible for the care of the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> at the time of marriage would be entitled, upon the confinement of the wife, to have a week’s parental leave, notwithstanding the fact that the <span class="highlight">child</span> Was not his own <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No less than 85 per cent of the family homes to be built by the State Housing Authorities with our advances will be allocated to families where the average gross weekly income of the main breadwinners will not exceed 85 per cent of average weekly earnings per employed male unit as defined in the agreement and, where the family includes 2 or more children, this will be increased by $2 a week for each <span class="highlight">child</span> beyond the second. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that any one of us here who received an application form telling us that we would receive $350 per <span class="highlight">child</span> would ensure that the application form was sent off in the next mail, affluent as we may be in comparison with the people concerned in this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill also discriminates in favour of those women who are able to return to work and against those who need to return but are unable to do so because of the unavailability of satisfactory <span class="highlight">child</span> care arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> care scheme introduced by the former Government was designed specifically to provide assistance to working women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition is concerned that the <span class="highlight">child</span> care program is not progressing to the time-table which was contemplated at its inception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, it was not until the second half of the nineteenth century that scientists demonstrated that both parents made equivalent conributions to a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s biological inheritance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet women’s <span class="highlight">child</span> bearing functions undoubtedly have served as the basis  of  restrictions and discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Based on the research initiatives of the Bureau, the previous Government introduced substantial measures in such important areas as employment training and, not least, the <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It must also be made clear that the former Government made social provisions for all women in respect of childbirth in the forms of a maternity allowance and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He put it that the former Government had been very concerned to assist women in employment in respect of their training and <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It made only passing reference to and expressed only passing concern for the payment of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The absence of adequate <span class="highlight">child</span> minding facilities is a major problem in itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a survey conducted by the Bureau of Census and Statistics in 1969 it was found that 400,000 working mothers had responsibility for children under 12 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Country Party accepts the position as outlined by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lynch),  when he spoke on behalf of the Opposition, that these benefits are provided for Commonwealth employees to enable them to prepare on full pay for confinement and to have some 6 weeks on full pay following the birth of the <span class="highlight">child</span> to make satisfactory arrangements for a return to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An extremely important adjunct to maternity allowances for those mothers who want to resume work is the provision of more <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government should be looking at other measures, such as increasing <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to enable all children to have as near as possible equal opportunities to utilise whatever talents he or she may possess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Denison  (Dr Gaha)  suggested that, instead of augmenting the family income by the payment of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, we should provide for the sale of houses at lower prices and that it should be possible to use the money now paid in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to amortise the cost of such an undertaking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker,  I am privileged that you are sitting in the chair at the moment because I know you had a very difficult task, probably one of the most difficult tasks, on King Island and that was to minister to the population which at that time consumed 5.5 pints of beer per week for each man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my statement to the press on 11 March 1973 I said that my Department would be seeking approval (from the Public Service Board) to appoint 48 multi lingual welfare officers, some of whom it was proposed would work with migrant children in schools and between the schools and migrants’ homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-59-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intention to make such appointments was first discussed however at a meeting with State education authorities on 12 January 1970, and there is reference to my Department’s intention to assess the need to extend its normal integration services, through the provision of interpreters and welfare officers to meet the requirements of the <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education program, in the Ministerial Statement made to Parliament on 23 April 1970 by the then Minister for Immigration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-59-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>New and larger premises are planned for Melbourne to accommodate the increased faculties which we are now providing under both the <span class="highlight">child</span> and adult migrant education programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-59-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are special superannuation arrangements, book and equipment allowance to Commonwealth Teaching Service students, the repeal of regulations affecting female officers’ absence from duty due to pregnancy and <span class="highlight">child</span> birth and finally the provision of special educational duties in respect of members of the Commonwealth <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-115-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On both those occasions I sought to make a plea for the student as a whole person and to recognise the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s total existence inside the school and out of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-115-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Furthermore, the general needs of our native people- in particular, the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">child</span>- have, I believe, at long last made their claims upon the consciousness and sense of justice of all progressive Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-115-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The members of the Australian Pre-Schools Committee and the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Standards Committee were selected on the basis of the contribution they could make to the work of the respective Committees in the fields of pre-school education and <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-117-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One thing that is happening as a result of the program of education in the vernacular for Aboriginal children is a new identity of parents with the schools, and the coming into being of Aboriginal parents councils in association with schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not see any great benefits in the general run of the mill fizzy drinks for the average Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> or adult so we cannot properly argue that the exemption resulted in nutritional benefits for the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Detailed programs will then be developed to implement the Government’s objectives that all children are given the opportunity of one year of preschool and that <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities are established to meet the needs of the children of working parents and under-privileged families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have already said that the Opposition applauds the expansion of the <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education program flowing from a survey which was commissioned last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-39-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At this stage I have no quarrel with that proposition - in fact I support it - ‘because it also gives support for isolated children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-39-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that there would have been too great a discrimination in favour of one area if the Aboriginal study grant scheme had been extended to cover the full area of secondary education and special provision for isolated children had not been made at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-39-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The father learns some English at work but when the <span class="highlight">child</span> goes back to the home environment there is probably often tension and difficulty if there is an attempt to speak English because the mother does not understand and does not want to be left out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-39-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This clarion call to women in the community hardly fits the absence of any tax deduction for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres in this Budget - a preelection promise which has been broken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course on 30 May 1973 he made the statement that ‘every school in Australia, including Geelong Grammar School, should receive a basic grant from the Commonwealth and that the Commonwealth should have an identity with the education of every <span class="highlight">child</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A further pertinent point is that some Press reports prior to the Budget predicted that the maximum tax deductions for a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s education expenses was to be severely cut. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One would hope that the Minister for Education could be persuasive enough of his own colleagues to induce them to honour a commitment that he made on their behalf while he was shadow Minister for Education to continue proportionate aid at the rate of 20 per cent of the cost of educating children in the state system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are schools whose educational resource comes about very often by the supreme sacrifice of parents in the belief that they should give their children an opportunity that they want them to have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result of the Government’s decision to withdraw aid from certain schools these parents will be forced to send their children to the state school system, thus adding to the cost burden of that system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is to be hoped that when the Minister for Education takes this matter to the Caucus he will be able to persuade the Caucus to honour his election promise so that every <span class="highlight">child</span> can receive the grants which they were assured by the Minister and the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  in the month leading up to the last Federal election, would be available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those children were not receiving the sort of education to which every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> is entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, adequate homemaker services are important to the middle income father with a sick wife and children and a home to be cared for, just as these services are vital to a modest and low income earning father confronted with a similar situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is considerably less than the annual cost of many other programs such as <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment - $210,835,000 in 1972- although more than the 1972 Australian Government expenditure on aged persons housing - $19m in the same year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the range of services which may be covered by the proposed expenditure is wide and the anticipated preventive value great, if we consider the cost of providing services such as children’s homes, deserted wives pensions and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People were living in slums and a computer or some boffin suggested that the cheapest, most efficient way to solve that problem was to tear the slums down and erect high rise flats in their place without thinking for one moment of the impact of that on the individual concerned and without thinking about the kind of environment, both social and other, of the <span class="highlight">child</span> living on the 31st storey of a 32-storey high rise flat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is rather significant that members of the Opposition give no credit at all to the Minister for Education  (Mr Beazley)  with respect to the polices he has advanced for children in rural areas which will provide $304 un-means tested for each <span class="highlight">child</span> 10 miles away from an appropriate school, the same amount if living more than 4 miles away from transport to a school and up to $1,000 a year for isolated children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The more important factor in regard to the outcome for the <span class="highlight">child</span> is its upbringing after birth rather than whether it was planned or unplanned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It said that there is a general cultural failure to relate the emotional and physical aspects of sex and to see them in the context of moral and social responsibility, that all the evidence emphasises that environmental factors, especially in the home, are far more important in regard to the ultimate outcome for the <span class="highlight">child</span> than whether the pregnancy was planned or unplanned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pressures of inadequate housing, as I have mentioned, <span class="highlight">child</span> minding facilities, adoption methods, the social status of women, the problems and attitudes of parents who might already have had a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> and their attitude to another pregnancy, surely are matters that ought to be encompassed within an inquiry that is to give this Parliament some realistic evidence and advice in these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the libertine proponents of abortion on demand may refuse to regard as an important side issue is: how far should abortion be a matter of serious concern to people other than the woman herself, and how are the lives of her parents, husband or future husband and past or future children affected? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firm evidence can be produced that abortion frequently reduces a woman’s future reproductive capability and subsequent children come at a. higher risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can also be shown that a man is more likely to have a sterile wife or a stillborn, premature or defective <span class="highlight">child</span> if he marries a girl who has had an induced abortion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is not it important that once an unwanted, unplanned <span class="highlight">child</span> is born the Government should have a responsibility for ensuring that that human life can be adopted into a good home? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that the opponents of abortion who demand that if a woman is pregnant she has that <span class="highlight">child</span> have a great responsibility to ensure that once that unwanted <span class="highlight">child</span> is born the utmost in adoptive facilities and counselling facilities should be provided to help that mother have that <span class="highlight">child</span> adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I would like to see is an inquiry into the circumstances which cause an abortion; the consequences of it; the action required to assist women in avoiding it; the action required to deter people from aiding and abetting it; the adequacy and effectiveness of family planning techniques; the action required to ensure that medical practitioners always act in the interests of the woman’s health; the action required to ensure that all services are available free of cost; the action required to establish the necessary supportive services; and, generally, the action required to ensure the preservation of the lives of the mother and her unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The commissioners should have access to the records of all Federal authorities, including health, social security, matrimonial causes and income tax authorities, and should have power to seek the cooperation of the respective State authorities in these jurisdictions, including the State law enforcement and <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare agencies; as far as practicable, the commissioners should comprise a mother who is experienced in social welfare work, a medical practitioner and a criminologist; and the commissioners should be assisted by senior counsel and have power to sit in camera. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There also should be provision for adequate family allowances, particularly the provision of appropriate <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should be concerned with the United Nations declaration on the rights of a <span class="highlight">child</span>, which is set out in the amendment, and which states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

    <p>Paragraph (d) refers to the question of housing and whether some particular assistance ought to be given to families; the question of the ability of the parent, whether single or married, to provide shelter for the <span class="highlight">child</span>; the question of <span class="highlight">child</span> minding facilities to which I have already referred; to pre-school facilities; the question of disabilities of families with handicapped children and the means of assisting them; and the question of domestic assistance for families and working mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this Bill goes through - of course it will - and capital punishment is abolished, the community must be protected from certain types of criminals such as the psychopathic criminal who goes out and rapes and kills a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wished to ask: How does the Prime Minister or anybody else in this chamber who supports his view rationalise his enthusiastic support for abortion on request with his equally enthusiastic support for the abolition of the death penalty for any crime including <span class="highlight">child</span> murder, hijacking, treason and so on?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand he enthusiastically supports the destruction of the life of an unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> not knowing whether it would be an hour, a day or a week before it would be born. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, I do not want to emphasise this too much or emphasise the fact that the supportive services, such as supplementary assistance and <span class="highlight">child</span> allowances, have not been adequately increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Applying the same exercise to a class A widow with a <span class="highlight">child</span> over 6 years of age, accounting for these price increases her pension should have risen from $28.50 as it was under the previous Government last October up to $30.42. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any school <span class="highlight">child</span> knows that land is expensive because not enough of it is on the market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the honourable member had listened to me from the beginning of my speech he surely would have realised - even an infant or a kindergarten <span class="highlight">child</span> could understand - that I was saying that prices policies have not been successful all around the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We members of the Country Party are concerned with every man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> living in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I heard about the situation of the <span class="highlight">child</span> on, I think, 27 August. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time I was informed by my Department that a critical situation was developing because of the demands of her natural father for the <span class="highlight">child</span> to go back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation has unfortunately developed over the last 5 years because of the hesitancy - a reasonable hesitancy - of officials in the past to return the <span class="highlight">child</span> when the parents wanted her back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I could determine the actual custody of the <span class="highlight">child</span> is a civil matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the actual facts of the return of the <span class="highlight">child</span>, I have not received full details yet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She is in the custody of her natural parents and as far as I can determine we as the Government have a moral duty to see that the ordinary services of the Australian community are available to them but we have no legal right to intervene between the parents and the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This incident is the end result of an unfortunate system that has developed over many years of taking children from their parents and then not making a final and real determination about the actual custody. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I can see, the welfare of the <span class="highlight">child</span> is of paramount importance but we must make sure that this sort of thing does not happen again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the authorities intervene between the <span class="highlight">child</span> and the tribal customs in situations such as this we are likely to create a position where the girl is an outcast in both societies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aspects of Aboriginal marriage arrangements which offend Europeans seem to be polygamy - or to give its correct name, so my experts tell me, polygyny - so called <span class="highlight">child</span> marriage and what is often called the promise system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly runs counter to some of our most cherished ideas, but many people who worry themselves about so-called <span class="highlight">child</span> marriage do not realise the extent to which this misrepresents the Aboriginal custom, and even insults the Aborigines, who in some ways could teach us a lesson or two about the care of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal tradition of <span class="highlight">child</span> care was at least as solicitous as ours; it was less authoritarian; and in practical psychology it was possibly more perceptive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was no bashed <span class="highlight">child</span> syndrome amongst them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had inquiries made about the movement of the <span class="highlight">child</span> Nola Banbiaga from her foster parents’ home in Darwin to her parents’ home at Maningrida. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nola is one of many Aboriginal children who, because there were no essential medical, educational or other facilities available at their parents’ normal place of residence, have been taken from their natural parents and reared in missions, orphanages, hospitals, institutions or private foster homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The grief that this policy has caused the Aboriginal parents is equalled only by the grief of the foster parents who have been called upon later to surrender a <span class="highlight">child</span> they have reared as their own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of this policy on the <span class="highlight">child</span> can only be guessed at, but there are outstanding examples of young Aboriginal men and women in our society who have overcome this trauma without loss of their cultural identity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we should not impose this burden on any more children or parents or foster parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New procedures must be developed to care for children found in this situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be easy for me to claim that the custody of Nola is a civil matter as indeed it is; but as the Australian Minister for Aboriginal Affairs I accept the responsibility of putting right the wrongs of history and ensuring, by a vigorous policy of developing educational, medical and similar services in remote Aboriginal communities, that the practice of separating mothers from their children ceases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are perhaps hundreds of children in orphanages and such institutions throughout Australia, as well as those with foster parents, who should be reconciled with their parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, some of the leading articles in newspapers for whose views I often have respect even if I disagree with them, carried racist assumptions that the <span class="highlight">child</span>, in going back to her parents, inevitably was in the wrong place and would be ill-treated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The life that Aborigines lead might well be austere, but to assume that they ill-treat children is quite wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is my own view: First of all, the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s welfare is paramount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said: ‘First of all, the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s welfare is paramount, but I cannot possibly be asked to solve that sort of question in this sort of situation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not blame anybody for not solving it in the past, except that I believe social workers as a profession should have taken much more effective steps to bring about a reconciliation between the foster parents, the parents and the <span class="highlight">child</span>, and taken steps to make sure that what occurred in this case does not occur again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The absolute authority, unless it can be proved in accordance with the law that- the <span class="highlight">child</span>” is neglected, is in the hands of the parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In such cases the Director of Social Welfare operated within the bounds of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Welfare Ordinance and in particular, part V of the Ordinance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the proper course had been followed in regard to Nola’s case a children’s court would have granted an order under section 36 (1) (b) of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Welfare Ordinance, which would have placed the <span class="highlight">child</span> under the care of the Director as in paragraph (i), or in the hands of the foster parents as in paragraph (ii). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this had been done, the taking of the <span class="highlight">child</span> back to Maningrida would be wrong under section 37(2)&lt;c). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the parents and indeed the Aboriginal Legal Aid Service which advises them could always apply to the same court to revoke an order under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Welfare Ordinance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, was Nola Brown a <span class="highlight">child</span> in respect of whom an order had been made under section 36 (1) (b) of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Welfare Ordinance committing her to the care of either the Director of Social Welfare and <span class="highlight">Child</span> Welfare in the Northern Territory or foster parents? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Were the foster parents entitled to the care of the <span class="highlight">child</span> under the ordinance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our real concern should be for the welfare of the <span class="highlight">child</span> and the right of the court to make a decision in such a matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appeal to the Minister in the light of the circumstances that surround this case that both he and his Government consider throwing the whole issue of foster parents and the system that is operating in the Northern Territory and under Commonwealth jurisdiction open to a full scale public inquiry in the hope that no other <span class="highlight">child</span> is victimised in the way that Nola Brown has been victimised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a vitally important matter for the children of Australia today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal <span class="highlight">child</span> is just as important as the white <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could mention another dozen or two organisations which are involved in pre-school education in different ways and which are not doing the <span class="highlight">child</span> a bit of good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is sincere and genuine in things of this nature and I am certain that he will go to great lengths to try to get to the bottom of it and to see that the <span class="highlight">child</span> Nola receives the best possible deal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There have been many cases of foster children, and this case has probably damaged the whole concept of the foster children scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Many people in the Northern Territory and no doubt in other parts of Australia were influenced to take children away from the circumstances which applied in this case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that when the investigation is carried out it will be found that the health situation of the <span class="highlight">child</span> and the actual feelings of the parents for the <span class="highlight">child</span> at the time were discussed between the foster parents and the Welfare Branch as it then was, of the Northern Territory Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>This Branch decided where children were placed and what they did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a pity if, after an Aboriginal <span class="highlight">child</span> grows up with a white family, its parents, for some reason or other, say that they want the <span class="highlight">child</span> returned to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Aborigines are missing a chance for their children to get a better start in life, especially if they do not wish to care for them in their early years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The opportunity is there for their children to be well looked after and reared. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These children can be used as bridgeheads into the European society to assist the Aboriginal cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Quite often over weekends, Aboriginal children would stay at my home in Alice Springs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They came from the Aboriginal hostel in Alice Springs to my home and played with my children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth has acted against the interests of every family and of every man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> in the State of New South Wales and in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It arose out of the then Government’s concern that both adult and <span class="highlight">child</span> migrants should have every assistance and every opportunity and in fact should get specialised assistance to acquire facility in the English language rapidly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the debate on 16 February 1971 it was mentioned that a joint CommonwealthNew South Wales Department of Education survey showed that, of 7,700 migrant children surveyed, English was spoken at home all or most of the time in only 15 per cent of the households. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>there has been a substantial development in the <span class="highlight">child</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was interested in the reference by the Minister for Immigration to a survey of <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education in schools of high migrant density in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of this investigation, as the Minister has said, Cabinet has approved a joint submission by the Minister for Immigration and the Minister for Education to extend the <span class="highlight">child</span> migration education program to include provision for supplementary accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very sorry that the Minister did not grant this application earlier this year because, as I am sure he would appreciate and endorse, pre-school education is of immense importance in the total education of any <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, as is suggested by this report, we could reduce in particular the difficulties faced by migrant children at this early stage of their development more costly educational programs later in their educational experience might be avoided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education program has been operating for approximately  2  years and the State education authorities are anxious to learn whether the agreement will be renewed at the end of the 4-year term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill enables the Australian Government to provide funds under the <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant, program, to help State and independent schools provide emergency accommodation, where ‘this is necessary, and to allow adequate special instruction of migrant children to take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Effectively only 20 per .cent of the children in the schools surveyed who need English tuition are receiving enough of it, and the largest single concentration of disadvantaged schools is located in and about Melbourne, where there are very high proportions of migrants from non-English speaking countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In effect .there is a blatant denial of the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s right to a meaningful and fulfilling educational experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like so many children in Melbourne’s northern and western suburbs, the migrant <span class="highlight">child</span>, in the present situation, needs more than intelligence, initiative, and determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the situation is bad for educationally deprived children, it is ironical that every <span class="highlight">child</span> learns something at school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No <span class="highlight">child</span>, however, fails to learn from school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we consider the problems that face us in the area of migrant education we cannot escape the conclusion that Australia’s post war immigration program has been irresponsibly administered in the area of migrant <span class="highlight">child</span> education, in the area of migrant adult education, and in the area of migrant integration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, there is a misunderstanding in the community that migrant children are naturally bi-lingual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They say that the <span class="highlight">child</span> educates himself with the help of the family, the peer group, the community at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They say that a <span class="highlight">child</span> can be influenced, brainwashed, indoctrinated by another person, but he cannot be educated by another person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most migrant children are usually completely exposed to a new environment amongst people who are unaware of these difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The migrant <span class="highlight">child</span> has the compounded problem and stress of having to live between 2 different cultures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Migrant children have first of all to bridge the gap between the beliefs and the duties of their own family and the quite different ways of thinking and behaving in the life they are experiencing in and out of school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these children reach adolescence experiencing these same stresses, at a time when they are struggling to establish their own identity as persons, the shock of finding themselves unable to communicate even at the simplest level must be a traumatic experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under these conditions only children with specific language aptitude have any chance of reaching their academic potential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister stated in his second reading speech that up to 60,000 children will be receiving instruction in special classes this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The initiatives of the previous Federal Government has resulted in advances in migrant <span class="highlight">child</span> education by providing the funds for salaries of special teachers; the purchase of capital equipment of the language laboratory type; the provision of suitable teaching and learning materials; and funds to cover the cost of training courses for special teachers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nowhere has this shown up better than in the recent statement from the Minister for Immigration,  Dr Forbes,  ‘ tossing a few random extra dollars to the Good Neighbour Councils here, pumping a little more into <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education there, setting up a few infactory language courses for new settlers, and grandly announcing a whole new approach to selection and counselling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was revealed to a large extent by the survey conducted into the needs of <span class="highlight">child</span> migrants in the schools in the high density migrant areas of Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that part of the discontent among migrant children sprang from the inadequacy of school premises to house the number of special classes that were warranted by the children in attendance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was no provision under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Migrant Education Program for accommodation of classes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That meant that the teachers and children were working in sub-standard .accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has already been pointed out in this debate, there are a number of methods used in teaching children English and integrating them into the general educational program of the schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One method, of course, is the withdrawal method of taking the children away from the classes to a special English class, giving them special tuition and then returning them to their ordinary classes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has already been pointed out by one of my colleagues, this has its problems because it withdraws the <span class="highlight">child</span> from the standard classroom curriculum in which he or she would otherwise be involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other schools - and there is one in my own electorate - have made specially trained migrant teachers responsible for the whole education program of a class of migrant children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that given adequate lapse of time an assessment will be made of the relative advancement of the withdrawal of children into a migrant English class and their grouping together in one class where the whole normal education program is supplemented by the special English training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member referred also to the report of the Queensland Task Force and specifically mentioned the application to the Department of Immigration for pre-school or <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am delighted to help these applications in any way that I can but I should explain that there is a Government policy for the development first of <span class="highlight">child</span>-care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Department of Education at present is responsible for receiving applications from organisations in the community for financial assistance towards the cost of establishment and operation of <span class="highlight">child</span>-care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the criteria against which applications are assessed is the educational content of the <span class="highlight">child</span> care to be provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly relates to migrant children in their early stage of settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be looking at this means to assist the integration of its people through the establishment of a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre along these lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are very conscious of the need to reach migrant children at the pre-school level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact we are very anxious to meet ail Australian children at the pre-school level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In reply to a contribution made, I think, by the honourable member for Batman, I would express the hope that our own children at the pre-school level would be able to have the exposure to language and cultures that would broaden the base of our Australian culture at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of Immigration, my own Department, is already providing special instruction to migrant children at pre-school age in the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres in migrant hostels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In addition, the Migrant Education Television Unit at Wollongong is already planning an educational television program directed to children of pre-school age for production in 1974-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of Immigration is also in touch with the Australian Pre-School Commission as part of our interest in ensuring that the needs of migrant children at pre-school age will be taken into account by that Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, the biggest problem is in the school area - an area where a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s basic disposition and motivation are formed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following a run of losses, if no relief is readily forthcoming - and it must be realised that a community’s ability to help can reach saturation point - either services will have to be restricted or parents already labouring under great difficulties and personal distress at the condition of their children, will have to be charged fees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A mother came into my office in my electorate of La Trobe with a young <span class="highlight">child</span> of 4 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That was the total free physical movement of which that <span class="highlight">child</span> was capable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until that time I had a fleeting understanding and a peripheral concern for the families of handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One thing that was apparent with the Darwin adult education centre was that about 200 children were being looked after at a creche or <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is no provision for a creche or <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centre, I hope that such a proposal will be very seriously considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the limited numbers enrolled at the Darwin adult education centre, 200 children were required to be looked after while their parents were attending classes and, with the greater numbers enrolled at the Community College, it surely will be necessary to take some steps, even if it is not in the original plan, to acquire a house in the near neighbourhood to be used as a <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centre so that these many students will be able to attend the college and not have to turn their backs on courses that otherwise they would have taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We now are faced with the much more massive problem which goes right to the root of our social structure, namely, of help for the young and the forming family and, particularly, help for the young couple at the time of the birth of their first <span class="highlight">child</span> or in the provision of the matrimonial home which is desirable at all times but becomes, I believe, necessary when the first <span class="highlight">child</span> is born. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But we should not have a social system which compels the mother of a young <span class="highlight">child</span>, for economic reasons, to go to work against her will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> is in fact familiar with the boomerang and the corroboree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the new Minister consider the <span class="highlight">child</span> at school who by instinct tends to progress along with the group, and yet may have the ability if he used personal individual effort to learn faster than the others? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We read a lot about malnutrition and how this is caused through lack of utilising the proper foods available and in the method of preparation, and in fact a lack of knowledge of the foods that are available to assist in rearing strong and healthy children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme that was introduced of allocating finance to a coloured family for every <span class="highlight">child</span> that attended a secondary school offset this to some extent, but I know that in some instances the <span class="highlight">child</span> only attends secondary school in order that the family gets the benefit of the finance, and not because of any desire to further his education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And again their idea of group living does not lend itself to the <span class="highlight">child</span> making an individual effort, and he cannot be blamed for this, but this certainly is one matter which must be looked at when thinking in terms of education for our coloured children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When there is an incidence of <span class="highlight">child</span> mortality that is 20 times higher than that for comparable European communities, there is a need to bring every possible health resource to bear on the problem - not just in the hospitals but in the treatment and provision of sewerage systems, water supplies and things of that kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember in an inquiry about the Alice Springs hospital people talking about the high mortality rate among Aboriginal infant children, and the Committee being given an account of a nurse going out into the area and finding an undernourished Aboriginal mother who would be given advice about taking her <span class="highlight">child</span> off breast feeding and putting it on to the bottle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have taken major steps forward in <span class="highlight">child</span> care because I think Canberra has more working mothers and more people with 2 jobs and 3 jobs than has any other city in the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of my last acts, perhaps almost on my last day, was to set aside 5 houses for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres in Canberra, and I hope the Minister will leave them that way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every <span class="highlight">child</span> has an equal right to participate in the distribution of education finance derived from public moneys. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman has referred to the isolated children’s scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I brought in the isolated children’s scheme the Western Australian Government went out of the isolated children’s scheme and used the $810,000 it saved to make grants to nongovernment schools and to raise them to the $104 level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The New South Wales Government makes a grant to families of $88 per <span class="highlight">child</span> if the <span class="highlight">child</span> is going to a private secondary school if the parental income is below $7,000 a year - this is the grant that will commence under the new New South Wales Budgetbut it is of no advantage to the school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">child</span> getting the $88 goes to a Catholic school whose fees are $150, that <span class="highlight">child</span> pays $62 plus the $88. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Karmel analysis was that the resources deployed behind the education of an average <span class="highlight">child</span> in State secondary schools was $511 per student. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Karmel exercise, which no political party had ever anticipated, stated that a dignified standard of education for every <span class="highlight">child</span> is 40 per cent above the existing State school level, which would be $715 per pupil at 1973 values of the dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The professional qualifications of the staff are similar to those of the Melbourne centre staff except that a <span class="highlight">child</span> health specialist will be employed instead of a psychiatrist at the outset. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-36-11">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Very few schools - and I refer to those which can be classed as schools of normally very high academic standards - have made a special effort to locate within the school centres for handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable gentlemen have ever seen the Commonwealth Government schools for the handicapped in the Australian Capital Territory they will know that under certain circumstances, where a <span class="highlight">child</span> has multiple handicaps, there is a ratio of one teacher for one <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On the question of the latch key children, I am not certain of any Commonwealth involvement in the Brunswick North Primary School question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pre-schools commission will be advising the Australian Government on grants that will be applying next year <span class="highlight">Child</span> care centres are being constructed under arrangements between the Australian Government and various authorities at the present time but I know of none either one way oi the other at North Brunswick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member will be aware that as far as <span class="highlight">child</span> migrants are concerned we are worried about the fact that the States have no classrooms for the children to be taken to and given special lessons in English, retiring from the normal classrooms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In effect there in a blatant denial of the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s right to a meaningful and fulfilling educational experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn to the needs of the handicapped children and particularly those who are psychologically disturbed and have specific learning difficulties or have difficulties of language expression and articulation; that is, to children who, under any proper system of priorities for educational expenditure, would receive prompt and proper care from the phychology and guidance branches of education departments, from the speech therapy branches of education departments and from remedial teaching staff of education departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A report presented recently to the Victorian Minister for Educa tion revealed that in that State, with a school population of 600,000 children, a mere 98 officers in the Psychology and Guidance Branch were available, 43 of whom were still in the process of training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that is a fair indication of the priority attached by the honourable member for Wannon and his State colleagues to the needs of the <span class="highlight">child</span> who is handicapped by emotional disturbance or by specific learning difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether the honourable member for Wannon and those who, like him, try to undermine the process by which these facts could regularly be brought under public scrutiny have any comprehension of the misery of the family and the <span class="highlight">child</span> when defects of speech get steadily worse over a number of years while that <span class="highlight">child</span> is waiting for treatment and none can be provided for him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have seen children identified by officers of the Victorian Education Department as having defects of speech in their first or second year at school and denied treatment for 3 or more years because of the gross shortage of speech therapists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For 3 or 4 years these defects became exacerbated and fed on themselves until the children concerned became speech cripples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether the honourable member for Wannon has any comprehension of the distress of parents and the <span class="highlight">child</span> where specific learning difficulties are identified and where 80 per cent of the children who receive the assistance which they require in the first year or 2 years of their school career, recover from those difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A majority of the children with these defects are denied the assistance that they need up to grades 5, 6 and beyond, even into secondary schools, where the prospects for successful action are remote indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to be a permanent commission backed by the national government - the one Government in Australia that has the resources to guarantee the future of every <span class="highlight">child</span>, and for that matter every adult, seeking an appropriate education in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless a <span class="highlight">child</span> is grounded properly in infant and primary school - I leave out of account secondary schools for the moment - there is no point in making attendance at universities free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alternatives have to be made available in order to make sure that children in the last 2 years of secondary education do not waste their time sitting in school simply because they have to and to make sure that they derive something of advantage to themselves when they leave school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I mentioned, I was associated recently with the Migrant Task Force in Queensland and I have been tremendously impressed with the way in which teachers, both in the State system and in the Catholic system of education, have been teaching migrant children, very often in what are very difficult circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we all have to admire teachers who teach migrant children whose knowledge of English is very modest, who teach in overcrowded class rooms with inadequate teaching material and very often in temporary class rooms built under schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ball is now back in the court of the States to take up the challenge and to work out priorities within their own systems of education to ensure that every <span class="highlight">child</span> within state schools receives the maximum benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But those people who argue that the report has in some way discriminated against Anglican schools, for example, fail to take into account that the Catholic education system has sought to provide education for every Catholic <span class="highlight">child</span> in a way which no other major denomination in this country has sought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I noted a statement of the Catholic bishops in which they expressed the view, amongst other things, that there should be some Government assistance given to the education of every <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know, of course, that the program being put forward under the Schools Commission legislation is by no means the only program which this Government advances for the education of Australian children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government inherited certain educational structures but this year, under the guidance of the present Minister for Education, we have had measures aimed at assistance in the education of isolated children, and a very high proportion of those children, by the very nature of things, attend Catholic schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are to have legislation to come into effect next year which will assist disadvantaged children for the first time and we await legislation on pre-schools and teacher training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government is making a contribution towards assisting every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government is determined to make a permanent commitment to the education of every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> and every Australian young man and young woman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that in the years ahead the Commission will make a major contribution to the education of all Australian children, whether they attend State schools or non-State schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been concerned for some time that opportunities for the special treatment of extremely gifted children in the Australian environment have not been available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this opportunity is denied these extremely gifted children in many cases the effect on the <span class="highlight">child</span> is extremely deleterious and as a result, of course, the Australian nation as a whole suffers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The standard of schooling a <span class="highlight">child</span> receives should depend neither on what his parents can or will pay nor whether he attends a government or an independent school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every <span class="highlight">child</span> must have the right to be prepared for full participation in society, both for his own and for society’s benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, of course, means special assistance for slow learners, handicapped children, Aboriginal children and, of course, children of migrant parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must have facilities but let us concern ourselves too with the provision of teachers for these children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Opposition support the need to look at the educational needs of handicapped children and handicapped young persons and to consider the needs of disadvantaged schools and of students at disadvantaged schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we seek to amend the legislation to have a broader concern for every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course you have an obligation to put a school in areas so that free education is available to every <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this way we of the Opposition believe that under this legislation a Commission can be established which will far more effectively carry out the philosophy enunciated by the Karmel Committee and at the same time raise the standard of education of every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> whilst preserving a right which Australians hold dear - the right to freedom of choice, the right to select the schools to which they send their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another very important aspect of the Housing Agreement with the States is that not less than 85 per cent of the homes to be built must be allocated to families where the average gross weekly income of the main breadwinner, exclusive of overtime and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments, does not exceed 85 per cent of average weekly earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where the family includes more than 2 children this limit can be increased by $2 a week for each <span class="highlight">child</span> after the second <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a member of local councils for many years in the Mount Druitt, Rooty Hill and Green Valley areas ‘I found tremendous problems with <span class="highlight">child</span> delinquency, parents who cleared out and broken homes because although the areas had been completed and one could not better the type of home found there, there was not a shopping centre, a park and recreation area or a community centre of any description; there were houses and nothing else and this created tremendous problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 25 September the Minister, in his earlier and happier capacity, made a statement about Nola Brown, the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">child</span> brought up from the age of 2 weeks in a European home and sadly abducted in Darwin and taken back to her tribal parents in Maningrida, whom she did not know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I listen to this babble I can remember that when I was a <span class="highlight">child</span> I heard a remark by a predecessor in this chair,  Mr Archie  Cameron, who said that the babble in the House reminded him of being in a 2-up school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every <span class="highlight">child</span> was treated in the same way and received the same per capita assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amount of this assistance was geared to a percentage - 40 per cent - of the average cost of educating an equivalent <span class="highlight">child</span> in a government school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was relatively easy and simple to administer, and took into account the right of every <span class="highlight">child</span> to basic adequate assistance and the inalienable right of every parent to exercise his inalienable right and responsibility to decide what type of education his <span class="highlight">child</span> would receive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely grade one is one of the most important years of a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s schooling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It reminded me strongly of speeches that I heard from members who are now in government, over a period of years when they pleaded with the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  the then Minister for Education and Science, to take account of what was happening in schools across Australia, other than those elite and fortunate schools from which he sprang and to which he, and his colleagues, customarily send their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a good deal of the resonance of that honourable gentleman’s attitude in the speech that was made a little earlier this evening by your colleague,  Mr Lucock,  the honourable member for Darling Downs  (Mr McVeigh),  who expressed great satisfaction with the approach to education of the previous Government when he said that every <span class="highlight">child</span> was treated the same way and that that made the system relatively easy and simple to administer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He paid some recognition - as I think he would not have done a few years ago - to the fact that such things as disadvantaged schools and disadvantaged children exist in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But he went on to say that if additional assistance over and above per capita grants were given to such schools and such children it would be charity and not justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to make no impact on the consciousness of honourable members opposite that a gross discrepancy exists between the resources available to the schools of which they traditionally and continually have been the champions and the schools at which the great majority of Australian children receive their education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the index of resources devoted to the education of a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a government school is expressed as 100 units, children who attend Catholic parochial schools and Catholic systemic schools have devoted to their education 70 units, and the resource allocation for children at non-government, non-Catholic systemic schools ranges from 40 units to 270 units. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An input of 270 resource units means small classes, favourable pupilteacher ratios, an abundant supply of teaching materials, lavish libraries - all the stimuli which will encourage children to take advantage of the capacity with which they are endowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the objective in trying to establish, over Opposition resistance, the Australian Schools Commission on a statutory basis to make sure that every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> has an equal opportunity to develop the capacities with which he is endowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall to honourable members opposite that whereas 80 per cent of the children from those schools for whom they speak in the Parliament complete their secondary education, only 30 per cent of the children from government and Catholic schools, for which honourable members on this side of the chamber speak, are able so to complete their secondary education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every <span class="highlight">child</span> attending school is an Australian citizen and is entitled to be treated equally with every other Australian <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is prepared to spend $800 a year on the secondary education of one Australian <span class="highlight">child</span>, every other Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> should be entitled to the same amount of expenditure by the same Government, and he should be entitled to it as a right, irrespective of the school he attends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A wealthy person - even a wealthy person such as the honourable member for Casey, on his salary - can send his <span class="highlight">child</span> to a government run school, pay nothing in fees and cost the taxpayers $800 a year for the education of his <span class="highlight">child</span>; yet he is quite capable of paying for that education, the same as anyone else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But he makes his children a charge on the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A struggling family on a much lower income than the honourable member for Casey may send their <span class="highlight">child</span> to an independent school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mother of the second family may work to send that <span class="highlight">child</span> to that school and the parents may make great sacrifices to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These schools will become the province of the wealthy and the children of ordinary parents who at present, by making considerable personal sacrifices, can send their children to these schools will be forced to withdraw them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of these schools will collapse and the others will become elitist schools attended only by snobbish children of snobbish parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government is throwing money around like a <span class="highlight">child</span> with 4 hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that what really communicates itself to a <span class="highlight">child</span> is the real qualities of the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s teachers, and those may not always relate to the doctrines the teachers profess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one is going to talk about who is getting the benefit in education I draw the attention of the honourable gentlemen opposite to these facts: Twenty-eight per cent of state school children complete a secondary education and can go on to a tertiary education; 35 per cent of children at Catholic schools complete a secondary education and can go on to a tertiary education; 86.5 per cent of children in non-Catholic non-government schools complete a secondary education and can go on to a tertiary education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a <span class="highlight">child</span> goes on to a tertiary education he really hits the taxpayers’ jackpot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a <span class="highlight">child</span> attends the non-government non-Catholic sector of education - which normally is the high fee charging sector - and he goes on to tertiary education he will get a subvention from the taxpayer which leaves the ordinary <span class="highlight">child</span> in the ordinary state school for dead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Deakin asked why $800 should be spent on one <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I presume that is what he thinks is the average spent on a state school <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (2) There is constant and on-going discussion between my Department and the Department of Education about ways of improving <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education, interspersed with major meetings on particular issues, for example emergency classroom accommodation and teacher-training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present law encourages blackmail, and may also encourage the seduction of children by those who would otherwise prefer adult contacts, but who imagine that <span class="highlight">child</span> seduction is less risky. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In our predominantly conformist, overtly masculine society, fixed on the 2-<span class="highlight">child</span> nuclear family mushrooming in suburban wastelands, the homosexual is an unwelcome outsider. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Genuine offences - such as rape, assault, indecent exposure, <span class="highlight">child</span> molesting and other acts - occur amongst heterosexuals as well as homosexuals, and are capable of being dealt with by laws which apply equally to all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the Prime Minister would be frank enough to say, even now, that he intends to accept virtually whatever advice the Commission gives him - as he is doing with the Coombs report - although that is <span class="highlight">child</span>’s play compared with this new body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In speaking to the estimates for the Department of Education I must say that it is surprising to me that the Government has departed from the practice of making per capita grants to assist independent schools in providing education for the children in that system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be little doubt that wherever independent schools are providing a standard of education comparable to that of state schools there is a saving for the Australian taxpayer to the extent that those schools receive less financial assistance than the cost of educating children in state schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The saving may be even greater now than it was in the past when the cost of educating children in primary schools was $308 per annum per <span class="highlight">child</span> and secondary schools received $520 per annum per <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who is claiming the maximum taxation deduction for education of $600 and who is sending his <span class="highlight">child</span> to a school where fees are around $800 or $900 a year is paying in excess of 50c in the $1 taxation - probably about 60c in the $1 - and about $400 of this $800 is returned to him as a taxation deduction; not only that but also 80 per cent of the students at those schools were receiving Commonwealth scholarships under the previous Government so that it meant the parents were again getting an increment from the Commonwealth by way of those scholarships; and not only that but also 90 per cent of the students of these schools went on to university and it was costing the Commonwealth Government of Australia about $5,000 per head per student for every year that they were at university. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They got the best that the Commonwealth was able to offer and for that they have used, cajoled and badgered and had every one in the establishment, including those bishops of the Catholic Church who were on-side, come in and back them to prop up a rotten, iniquitous per capita grants system that denied a <span class="highlight">child</span> in an electorate such as the one I represent, at a school with a pupil-teacher ratio of about 50 to one the opportunity of obtaining a reasonable standard of education and access to tertiary education later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet honourable members opposite argue that the parents of those children should get the same treatment as someone in my electorate with a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a mud playground, being taught in a portable hut where the pupil-teacher ratio is about 40 to one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Maranoa and others have complained that the present policy of this Government on education discriminates against children who attend boarding schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government recognised for the first time the unique and special problem that exists in educating children from isolated areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was this Government which for the first time provided money in respect of those children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Between $300 and $1,000 is being paid in respect of each of those children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal-Country Party Government of New South Wales - a government of the same colour as honourable members opposite who rise and say that our Government has taken money from the hands of children who go to boarding schools - immediately the grant for isolated children was made available, withdrew the payment of $80 a year which it made in respect of those children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The LiberalCountry Party Government in New South Wales withdrew $80 a year in respect of each <span class="highlight">child</span> in that category because this Labor Government had taken on the responsibility of meeting this dire need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although all parties have expressed the desire to see pre-school education made available for every <span class="highlight">child</span>, the manner in which that pre-school education will be provided is giving many people a great deal of concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that approach is adopted there will be, firstly, a reduction in community involvement in education and, secondly, a very much slower development of the program of pre-school education for every <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If many of the committees that are now currently operating and raising funds to buy the land on which the kindergarten would be built, had available to them the facilities of lending institutions, those committees would be able to provide kindergartens for children who are now without them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of there being a situation where there are more committees without kindergartens than there are kindergartens with committees, the situation would be reversed and we would be getting closer to the target of providing pre-school facilities for every <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A working party of the Schools’ Council of Great Britain, after a study of socially disadvantaged children in Secondary Schools wrote as follows: “The most decisive factor is not the material home background, not the neighbourhood, not the kind of school the <span class="highlight">child</span> attends- important as these are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What he was really saying was that he wanted local government to remain a dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> of the States and that councils should be kept in a Statetightened straight-jacket - this from a man who claims that the Australian Government is trying to shackle the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The policy of provision on a roughly equal basis for all children in schools to which all had access was a considerable advance on policies operating before the introduction of public education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was assumed that each <span class="highlight">child</span> was born with a certain fixed capacity and that if all external barriers were removed by providing schooling that was accessible, equal and free, students from all walks of life would have an equal opportunity for success. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I represent an area in which many of the families have raised their level of aspiration for their student children to as high as university level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With their general level of income, there is no possibility for them to sustain a <span class="highlight">child</span> at a university. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The abolition of the fees, which now run at $400, $500, and $600 a year, will make a substantial contribution to their opportunity to allow their children to attend a university. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Was Nola Brown a <span class="highlight">child</span> in respect of whom an order had been made under section 36 (1) (b) of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Welfare Ordinance committing her to the care of (a) the Director of Welfare or (b) foster parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-17">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If so, were the foster parents entitled to the care of the <span class="highlight">child</span> under the Ordinance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is referring to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment records and electoral rolls, the 2 sources the Government claims it will use-  an estimated 80 per cent of the population will be covered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The birth of a <span class="highlight">child</span> is normally an event of great joy to the parents.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when that <span class="highlight">child</span> is found to be handicapped - whether mentally or  physically, or both - the joy can turn to sorrow and anguish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the tragic case of those children who are totally dependent on their parents and the other members of their family, no amount of affection can ever overcome the despair which is generated by the totality of their demands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, the parents’ affection for their <span class="highlight">child</span> sustains them and provides them with the fortitude to face up to their situation and gives them the energy and stamina necessary to continue - in many cases, virtually 24 hours a day every day of the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This situation is outlined with considerable poignancy and clarity in the following letter, sent to me by one of my constituents,  Mrs N.  McKay, of Frankston, who has given me her permission to read it to the House on the basis that reference to it would be helpful to the House in understanding the very difficult problems facing the parents of handicapped children in Australia today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> - of Australian birth! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>who anticipates, plans and applies solutions to her every problem - not for the5 or 6 years of a normal <span class="highlight">child</span>’s complete dependency, but in monotonous repetition, every day of every week, of every year, without relief, or even the bare comfort of a compassionate Government subsidy to perhaps permit assistance in sharing the burden? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mother has to achieve all the organising and implementing management of a normal household, in addition to the complexly of providing for her handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Caliper/ boot replacements cost $25 (not $8 to $10), provision for wheel chair, equipment such as special living and walking aids to attempt some relief from Fiona’s immobility, the capital and running costs of seasonal heating and cooling to protect the <span class="highlight">child</span> against temperature extremes, an annual contribution of $140 to the day centre, the costs of transportation, etc., etc., are some of the facets where we might expect some sharing from Government expenditure, and dispensation from taxes paid each year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without introducing boredom into this communication, it may perhaps be agreed, that the asociated problems and costs of caring for a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> are deserving of your every attention and the immediate action of our Federal Government to grant essential priority, to bring some relief to such a household as ours, forthwith by payment of a subsidy of weekly value, at least 25 per cent of the costs, which would otherwise be paid by the government, should they be charged with the responsibility of support for our <span class="highlight">child</span>! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, it is not being melodramatic to say that the pressures bearing down on parents endeavouring to cope with a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> are so great that they have caused some of them to suffer psychiatric problems serious enough to demand treatment, have led to the breakdown of a not inconsiderable number of marriages and, according to a recent survey in the Melbourne area, have caused an unspecified number of suspected suicides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same Melbourne survey showed that many of the brothers and sisters of retarded children also were suffering, to the point where they were under psychiatric care or attending <span class="highlight">child</span> guidance clinics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, there is the question of physical damage to the house itself when the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> is cared for by his parents at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a large number of instances, it was found that because of the ‘disturbed’ behaviour of the retarded children - many of them hyperactive - their homes were subject to considerable wear and tear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a good thing that the Government is doing something for children who have lost both their parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past this responsibility has fallen within the provision of the States and their <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Not very long ago it was fairly uncommon for a woman to leave her husband and abandon him with the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should start by paying what I would call a motherless <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be paid to children who have lost both parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A motherless <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance could also be paid in respect of children who are in the custody of their father either because their mother is dead or because she has deserted the family home and has left the children uncared for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps some kind of housekeepers’ allowance could be paid or some help could be given to board out the children so that they could come home at weekends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope at least that a motherless <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance will be introduced in the near future and that later it will be supplemented by a housekeepers’ allowance or something like the mother’s allowance that is given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a terrible hardship for a man who has lost his wife - even by desertion and much worse if he has lost her by death - to find that he is placed in a financial position in which he has to break up his young family and perhaps lose contact with his dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have no children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a change in that position when the first <span class="highlight">child</span> arrives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Blacktown there is a <span class="highlight">child</span> immunisation clinic worth $12,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate the Government for plugging two of the gaps in areas of social welfare injustice in providing for the single or no-parent families with dependent children, the supporting mother’s benefit, which clarified one area, and the double orphan’s pension for the parentless or orphan <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that I am speaking on the same subject as did the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)  but I am quite happy to do that because I believe that there is one area still outstanding which is the single most serious area of social welfare injustice in Australia, and that is the single male parent with dependent children, the widower, the divorced or the deserted father. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The woman has a problem in earning an income while she looks after the house and the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The man has the problem of paying for the housekeeper and <span class="highlight">child</span>-minding facilities while he earns an income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A woman, if she has one dependent <span class="highlight">child</span>,  can work  and earn up to $26 a week before the benefit of $32 a week is reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The man is not even allowed <span class="highlight">child</span>-minding or housekeeper services as tax deductions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there should be some payment to cover the housekeeping and <span class="highlight">child</span>-minding expenses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as a purely tentative suggestion I suggest a payment of $10 a week for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> and $5 a week for succeeding children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A man on the minimum wage and with a wife and one <span class="highlight">child</span> to maintain will not have to pay anything. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With more children, the amount that he can earn and still not pay any levy will go up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A man with 2 children will be able to earn $64.50 and pay no levy; a man with 6 children will be able to earn $82.10 and pay no levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time, the Treasurer also announced that the handicapped children’s ‘benefit would be doubled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This benefit is payable to the proprietor of an approved handicapped persons home for each day on which the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> receives handicapped person care in that home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principal aims of the Government in the area of special education for the handicapped are as follows: First, the development of each handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> to the fullness of his potential as an effective integrated, selfrespecting and independent person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Third, the condition the <span class="highlight">child</span> must surmount is not the only objective of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The focus should be an the <span class="highlight">child</span> as a total person, living in a family and a community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourth, we need a comprehensive screening system for the early identification of handicaps - in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, in pre-school, in primary school and in secondary school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To implement the report of the Interim Committee of the Schools Commission on the subject of handicapped children we must develop a system of administration which actually expresses compassion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to detect need in children we must face the fact that families most at risk are least likely to go voluntarily to infant welfare clinics, least likely to use <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, least likely to have the services of competent medical practitioners, social workers or phychological advisers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Research is needed to identify what characteristics of children are most predictive of subsequent educational and social difficulty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We just do not have enough trained people capable of physical, intellectual, emotional and social assessment of any <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With one exception, none of the powers proposed to be transferred by the referendum will benefit the people of this country in a personal way, as was done in 1946 in the amendment, by referendum, to section 51 (XXIII  a)  of the Constitution which conferred power on the Australian Parliament to make provision for such benefits as <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, unemployment, sickness and hospital benefits and family allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will it increase <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment in order to achieve these purposes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to things such as <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, assistance for aged persons and environmental protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to note the increased allocation of $10,420,000 for 1973-74 for the <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education program as compared with the actual expenditure for 1972-73 of $5,061,184. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The greatest increase occurs in the area of <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education, and I for one am acutely aware of the need for this increased expenditure in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How often have I seen reticent, nervous, bewildered migrant children, newly arrived from overseas and subjected to all the competitions in Australian schools, with totally inadequate linguistic ability or preparation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Expenditure on <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education is expected to reach SIO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major portion of this expenditure will finance the salaries of special teachers for migrant children in government and independent schools in all States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of children receiving this kind of education and assistance will rise from 40,000 to 60,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As previous speakers have mentioned, there have been increases in the adult migrant education and the <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education program this year provides for an expenditure of $10,420,000 as against $5,061,184 expended last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it is worth remembering that this organisation was the <span class="highlight">child</span> of the late Harold Holt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has more children living in it than certainly any other place in the whole of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has needs for assistance to provide access roads, for transport to remove the chaos from the roads, for improvements in education and health facilities, for recreation centres and for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In China there are children’s palaces to care for children after school hours, in other words, the latch key children, the children waiting till their parents come home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Shanghai alone there are 1 1 children’s palaces in all taking between 1,000 and 1,500 children a day and undertaking every possible type of activity - hobbies, sports, the arts, music and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This type of thing needs to be looked at in this country, just as we need to give far greater emphasis to <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres for the children of those women who have to work, not because they want to work but simply because of economic circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I have said, there are very great needs in those areas for roads, <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities and recreation facilities for the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the first things I did when I became Minister for Social Security was, for instance, to amend the regulations so that in a situation in which a mother is in a maternity ward of a hospital with an infant <span class="highlight">child</span> who is under 10 days old and requires intensive treatment that <span class="highlight">child</span> is covered for medical and hospital benefit purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first occasion on which specific provisions regulating disclosure of information about clients was included specifically in legislation occurred in the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Endowment Act 1941. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are families where there is at least one <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 years and where <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment is paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is possible to establish which children do and which do not go onto higher educa-tion because of the transition to student endowment; and again personal details on these young people can be retrieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We can pinpoint every birth, we know whether the mother was single or married, who was the father of the <span class="highlight">child</span> and so on because of our payment of maternity allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A recent instance, for which I did not give approval and about which I knew nothing, concerns access to personal files related to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment recipients. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The information sought was the mother’s age at the time of the birth of the first <span class="highlight">child</span>, the time interval between subsequent births, age at the time of births of the last or most recent <span class="highlight">child</span> and the mother’s nationality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not possible to obtain the required information other than by examination of actual <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment files. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Approval was subsequently given to allow the university staff to extract the required data from <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment files held in the Sydney office on which payment had been terminated 12 months earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment files held in our Sydney office and on which payment terminated 12 months earlier are culled for destruction each 4 weeks, they will be made available to you for examination and extraction of data regarding the ex-endowee’s <span class="highlight">child</span>-bearing history; where the earlier portion of a file is held in archives, arrangements will be made for it to be obtained and made available to you. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Acting Minister for Education: How many capital projects in Victoria have been approved in principle by the Minister under the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it is apparent that State health authorities will have to follow the reasoning that country children with their economic standard and possibly greater access to protein from milk than, say, children in densely populated inner city areas will be the first to be able to forego the milk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, ready availability of school milk in some areas has played an important part in helping the <span class="highlight">child</span> acquire a taste for and an appreciation of the value of milk in later life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The generally poor knowledge of nutrition in the community, the persistent commercial pressures to buy food products of relatively poor nutritional value, the common absence of both parents at work, and the increasing tendency to let the <span class="highlight">child</span> choose foi itself, all point to the fact that even in our affluent society such a positive and pertinent step as the provision of school milk is essential if good nutrition of the young is to be assured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until he is able to do that he is not likely to be able effectively to get the <span class="highlight">child</span> to the point where it can learn efficiently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The professional qualifications and the interest shown by the various teachers have an enormous part to play in the total education of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that nobody has the complete answer to what is the best method of educating both children and adults. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incidentally, this is why I am such a great advocate of freedom of choice being offered to people, not only parents in the education of their children but also to adults when they have the opportunity of carrying on their education later in life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Gwydir  (Mr Hunt)  mentioned children with specific learning difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a teacher, I have taught children who, although appearing to be and in fact being very intelligent and able to cope in many ways, have had a blind spot in their ability to grasp certain information - perhaps in reading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time I had not heard the word ‘dyslexia’ but I am pretty sure in my mind, looking back on it, that that <span class="highlight">child</span> had dyslexia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I had been specially trained and if the facilities had been available to give that <span class="highlight">child</span> a better education by providing the specialist service that was available, he and, I believe, the community would have been much better off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we would all agree that there are difficulties in doing this, with sufficient regard being paid to the ability of children to reach this level in the first place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree entirely with the honourable member for Gwydir that, unless a <span class="highlight">child</span> has sufficient motivation and has been given sufficient opportunity in his early schooling to become motivated and to be able to build upon that groundwork, he will have great difficulty in establishing himself and gaining benefit from tertiary education although it may be completely free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Pre-school education is recognised now as a most necessary start to the education of our children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Work done by teachers at this level is important to the future success at higher levels of schools, and greater support is necessary not only from the Federal Government but from State governments which also must recognise the rights of our young children to pre-school training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that the environment and the relationship between the teacher and the <span class="highlight">child</span> will have a much greater influence on educattion than the surrounding facilities which, as I mentioned, are being given great attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an ever stronger argument for increased pre-school activity for our Aboriginal people and children in rural Australia who do not always have the advantage of constant communication and association with other children in some form of tuition before primary school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not easy and it will not be an easy task, since each <span class="highlight">child</span> is an individual and responds to different circumstances, techniques and personalities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer honourable members to the ministerial statement made in this House by my colleague, The Minister for Education (Mr Beazley), on 23 August last in which he clearly set out that this Government, for the first time, really would give to education all that was needed to ensure that every <span class="highlight">child</span> in this nation was educated to the utmost of his or her talents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think I should delay the House any further, except to say that the philosophy of the Government in all aspects of education is to ensure that no <span class="highlight">child</span> is prejudiced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In looking at page 3 of the Bill which relates to the definition of a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>, and, I think, at page 5 relating to the definition of special education teacher training courses and the definition of special schools, I would have some doubt as to whether children experiencing special learning difficulties would be covered in the ambit of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While this legislation does make provision for assistance to be given to disadvantaged schools - the special schools looking after handicapped children in the traditional sense of the use of the word ‘handicapped’, which does not include children with SPELD problems - there is doubt about whether it is the Government’s intention to include children ..with special learning difficulties under the general definition of ‘handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’ and ‘special school’ in which case they are being lumped in with all other handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Basically, that is not something which parents of children in this category or experts in this area would like or want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any case, I should be grateful to the Acting Minister if he could explain the impact of this Bill on this problem which does cover quite a significant number of Australian school children with special learning difficulties in all schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second category of schools to which I want to address myself today is those schools which cater for mentally and physically handicapped children and the special services which enable mentally and physically handicapped children to receive assistance in conventional schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its waiting list has grown longer year by year until we find ourselves in a situation now in which the <span class="highlight">child</span> whose speech defect is identified in grade 2 is unlikley to receive treatment for that defect until he reaches grade 5 or even grade 6. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it would be fair to say that in Queensland the pressure for schools comes from the growing suburbs where the <span class="highlight">child</span> population is very high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In areas in my own electorate where the infant population is very high, new schools have to be provided quickly and existing schools have to be expanded very quickly in order to keep up with the increase in the number of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> who is unfortunate enough to be sick is placed on a bed under the stairs where every pupil passes by. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the handicapped, the slow learner, the migrant or the <span class="highlight">child</span> with speech defects or emotional problems there is no specialist staff to back up the teacher in the classroom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result is that whether one looks to retention rates or to the students who are able to proceed to a tertiary education, one finds that children who come from lower socio-economic status families are in no way proportionate to their numbers in the overall population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is talking about 5.5 per cent of all children who attend non-government schools - not 5.5 per cent of all children in Australia, lt is this same 5.5 per cent of non-government school children whose parents are able to claim $400 a year for each <span class="highlight">child</span> in taxation rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the future the same category of children will probably go on winning a disproportionately higher number of secondary scholarships and a disproportionately higher number of tertiary scholarships that will give them free education under the Labor Party program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both  Mr Dunstan  and  Mr Hudson,  on the one side, and the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and the honourable member for Richmond  (Mr Anthony),  on the other side, as well as many other people, would agree that discrimination between children has got less and less and that the gap has been closed to a greater and greater extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the intention of the Government in regard to the awarding of scholarships is to go to the extent of saying that no <span class="highlight">child</span> of tomorrow will be able to get up with head in the air and say: ‘Despite where I was born, despite the conditions I have been brought up under, I won a scholarship’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The argument develops when we come to environmental reasons which include such factors as ease of study, whether the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s parents talk intelligently, and whether they keep up with contemporary matters and news. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we add on to the amount to be spent by the Commonwealth the amount which the States are spending the total expenditure is probably nearly $1,000 per year per head for every Aboriginal man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sister Stacey is well known throughout Australia for her magnificent work for Aboriginals at Alice Springs Hospital, where her specific responsibility has been the training of Aboriginal mothers in maternal and <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>She told the story that Aboriginal mothers, being extra maternal if such a thing is possible, were quite wonderful when it came to learning the procedures and techniques of raising children according to modern standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It appears that with these people who move from tribal ground to tribal ground, or to various parts of their tribal ground, the custom is for the healthiest <span class="highlight">child</span> to receive the major care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Hence the health of the very small and very delicate infants is very likely to decline and all the good work that takes place at the maternal and <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare centres is lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Australian Capital Territory, each Parent Association accepts specific responsibilities in the preschool system and, in providing educational equipment, fruit, and funds for cleaning of the school, approximately $35 per <span class="highlight">child</span> per annum is spent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-26-10">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Opposition not only wants that sum of money spent, but also wants to see retained the principle that every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> is entitled to a grant regardless of the school to which the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s parents send it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>House of Representatives the security of the basic grant to every <span class="highlight">child</span> attending a nongovernment school is preserved, as it should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Twenty-two per cent of all Australian children attend those schools, and this affects every one of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous Government passed legislation which provided grants for each <span class="highlight">child</span> - $104 for secondary pupils and $62 for primary students, which at that time was 20 per cent of the cost of running a government school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fundamental principles as we see them are these: All children, no matter to which school their parents send them, should receive a grant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There should be distributed, on top of this fundamental grant to every <span class="highlight">child</span>, much larger funds according to need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is why the Opposition supports the Karmel Committee’s report and why it insists that this per capita grant to every <span class="highlight">child</span> should be preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are saying that, for the sum of less than $5m, every <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia shall have that basic equality of education in which every <span class="highlight">child</span> is entitled to a grant and that on top of that extra sums should be provided on the basis of need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By implication, throughout the election campaign last year every member of the then Opposition was saying to the parents of children in the private schools: ‘You can vote Labor, and the principle of per capita grants will be retained’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition wishes not only to ensure that this money goes to education but also to see retained the principle that every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> is entitled to go and his parents have a freedom of choice to send him to whatever school is selected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The children are the same; but honourable members opposite are fooling themselves, although they are not fooling the people of Australia, when they say that there is no inequality between the <span class="highlight">child</span> of a man on $50,000 who chooses to send that <span class="highlight">child</span> to Melbourne Grammar or Sydney Grammar and the <span class="highlight">child</span> of a bus driver on $80 a week, $100 a week, or whatever it happens to be who has to send his <span class="highlight">child</span> to a state school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We believe that every <span class="highlight">child</span>, regardless of where he comes from, whether he comes from Surrey Hills or the electorate of Casey, has a fundamental right to a basic level of support in terms of education expenditure from the Federal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its firm belief in the principle that each Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> should receive basic recurrent educational suppott by a grant from the Australian Government of a proportion of the per pupil cost in government schools irrespective of the school attended and that further grants according to need should be added to this bask grant- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What sort of feeling have those who sat on this side of the House for 23 years had for those children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee decided to press the urgent need for an integrated approach to the planning of health and welfare services in Albury-Wodonga; to bring to the notice of the Ministerial Council the acute shortage of social welfare workers in the area, particularly those experienced in youth work; to ask the Cities Commission for a study of the effect of the growth centre on the ecology; to press for the regular release of planning information so that Albury-Wodonga businessmen can plan for the future; and to ask that the Development Corporation consider the need for infant and <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities in commercial development and community facilities, as well as providing for the disabled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Also what I have constantly said and I repeat now is that we want to see the expenditure of the Karmel money and, in addition to the expenditure of that money, we wish to see - at an’ estimated total cost of not more than $5m per annum - every Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> as a matter of justice and of equity attract to that <span class="highlight">child</span>- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The handicapped children’s benefit is payable to charitable and religious organisations conducting approved homes accommodating and caring for both physically and mentally handicapped children under 16 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As announced in the Budget Speech, it is proposed to double the rate of benefit to $3 a day for each <span class="highlight">child</span> at an estimated cost of $0.2m in 1973-74 and $0.5m in a full year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I want to make relates to the contradiction that parents of handicapped children face. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they send their <span class="highlight">child</span> to be accommodated in an approved home, the organisation running that home will receive $3 a day towards the cost of caring for the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if the parent is unable to have the <span class="highlight">child</span> accommodated the benefit is not paid, and he is deprived of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps it is just as difficult for those living in metropolitan areas to obtain accommodation at a home for their children because of the shortage of beds and facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, parents may believe that it is their responsibility to care for a <span class="highlight">child</span> at home, believing that that is where the best care can be provided for the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In such cases, the <span class="highlight">child</span> goes to a special day school of some type. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such parents already carry a heavy financial and emotional burden in having handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is an anomaly that a parent of a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 years of age should receive no assistance at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An extension of either of those 2 existing schemes or some other scheme that I am sure the Minister and this Government - or any Government - could dream up could be appropriate to cover this anomaly and weakness with regard to the important matter of handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With reference to the case of  Mrs King  of Canberra and her efforts to adopt her foster <span class="highlight">child</span>, Kelly, will the Minister investigate the situation with a view to maintaining what is now a happy family unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-54-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is nothing in his motion to that effect, if we support this motion today we would be voting to require a total vote of the Australian people to decide the question - that is, every man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> in the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The motion moved by the honourable member for Warringah deserves to be treated with a certain amount of ridicule because it is an impossible proposal embracing, as it does, every man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> voting on every suggestion - good, bad or indifferent - which will be presented to and decided on by the Australian people at tremendous cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Irrespective of what the Tories opposite say, I believe that every Australian - man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> - will endorse our action as being appropriate in this age of changing times, advancement and Australian nationhood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The evidence is that where this decision is taken out of the hands of the parents, and where the <span class="highlight">child</span> is given no option except to take free school milk, in many cases the <span class="highlight">child</span> refuses it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Large percentages of Aboriginal children are constitutionally affected by cows’ milk; it literally makes them sick, and this is not an appropriate remedy in all cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the importance of the care and education of young children, both to the children themselves and to parents and community at large, the Government welcomes widespread comment within the next few months on the report and its recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime, the Government will continue to allocate the S8m provided in the present Budget for the establishment and operation of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of both <span class="highlight">child</span> care and pre-school facilities, there are serious inequalities in existing services, and the need for action is urgent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The argument in relation to consultation with the States is very interesting when we remember that late last year the then Government introduced a Bill relating to <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres which took no account whatsoever of State Departments of Health which were looking after that matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, it absolutely overrode them and did not even place those <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres within the Federal Departments of Health or Education and Science but in fact made them part of the Department of Labour and National Service, as it was then called. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, when people talk about consulting the States and protecting State rights, I would have thought that the pre-school education and <span class="highlight">child</span> minding area was very specifically one for the States; but in cases in which it suited the former government it had no compunction at all in excluding the States from its legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There were many people who, in the early days when it was dangerous to do so, asserted that every <span class="highlight">child</span> in this country was entitled to equality and to justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Many of the people who did it in the days when it was dangerous to do it still survive here, and they will continue to survive here because the principle that every <span class="highlight">child</span> in this country should attract a sum of money as of right, regardless of the school to which the parents choose to send the <span class="highlight">child</span>, is right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Party - the Liberal Party - insists that that principle of the right of every <span class="highlight">child</span> to receive a per capita grant should be maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is that in addition to the per capita grant to every <span class="highlight">child</span> Government funds should be made available on the basis of need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  as he now is - the Leader of the Opposition as he then was - and the Minister for Education  (Mr Beazley),  as he now is - the honourable member for Fremantle - both made promises last year that there would be no cut in any existing grant to any <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever has been the outcome of the negotiations that have gone on, however the members of the Country Party vote tonight, I assert that they will stand by the principle that every <span class="highlight">child</span> should attract to itself as a matter of right and of equity and of justice a per capita payment for education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It concerns the statement he made this week that the States have failed to show specific areas of need that would justify the continuation of the distribution of free milk to all Australian school children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My Government, having brought about the abolition of fees within the area of tertiary and technical education, and having introduced comprehensive forms of assistance to upgrade primary and secondary education, is now concentrating its attention on the area of <span class="highlight">child</span> care and pre-schooling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740228_reps_28_hor88/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Embassy has given all the assurances in the world that we do not wish to interrupt the course of justice and the hearings in Austria, but we have certainly said, through all the means that are available to us, that the mother and the <span class="highlight">child</span> should be able to get together and I would hope that the representations that are being made in a continuing way to the Austrian authorities will persuade the Austrian authorities to recognise the rights of this Australian mother in this situation and also to act in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What has happened lends impetus to the efforts that are being made by the Government to achieve some agreement with overseas countries that court orders made in Australia should be recognised in other countries and that the rights of Australian citizens in relation to children of dual nationality should be properly appreciated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following these discussions, the stage has been reached where, subject to the passage of the legislation in this period of Parliament, the first payment direct to credit union savings accounts will be of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and they are planned to commence in July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has received the first report of the Australian Pre-schools Committee which recommends considerable payments for both pre-schools and <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres in all States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Camperdown children’s hospital, an average of 20 miles from the centre of the western metropolitan area, where these 4 hospitals are situated, averages 100 to 150 <span class="highlight">child</span> cases each day from this western area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As can be appreciated, with an average annual increase in population within this western area of 25,000 people, practically all of whom are young people with young families, the probems associated with the hospitalisation and care of children are practically impossible to surmount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The hospitals I mentioned are not equipped with the necessary specialists to deal with <span class="highlight">child</span> cases and their journey to Camperdown hospital of 20 miles becomes a nightmare to the parents of the children, with waiting time after they get to the hospital creating a tremendous problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Government talks about an assessed, seasonal or adjusted family income, which allows for a deduction of $300 for every <span class="highlight">child</span> undergoing full time primary or secondary education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>67m is available for expenditure in New South Wales between now and 30 June to establish and maintain education and care services for preschool children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>25m which have already been approved to New South Wales private organisations under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Arrangements could be made for operational support of existing pre-schools designated as contributing particularly to opportunity for children in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For existing pre-schools, Australian Government assistance would contribute to staff salary costs and would be available to avoid the need for parent contributions in respect of pre-schools catering especially for children in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might say that, unlike the <span class="highlight">child</span> care grants which on the capital side are expected to obtain approvals amounting to $ 13.5m by 30 June, the pre-school grants are grants to the States whereas the <span class="highlight">child</span> care grants result from direct dealings with local government or local charitable organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that in the next financial year the Government will provide the thrust that is so urgently required in the pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> care fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many other matters were overlooked in  Her  Majesty’s Speech; and I should like to mention before I have to conclude that <span class="highlight">child</span> care and probate were important matters on which the Government could have commented but did not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to providing an increase in the pension because of the inflationary spiral, steps should also be taken to stop this inflationary spiral in which case, of course, not only would the pensioner be better off but also every man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> and every industry in Australia would be better off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When talking about technical education, other parents will often say to you: ‘That is all right for your <span class="highlight">child</span>, but I want my <span class="highlight">child</span> to go to a university’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Provision has been made to erect 3 new <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres in my electorate alone and possibly a fourth one in the Hobart area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres are of high quality, and I suppose that this is one of the problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the rate to which this Government has allowed inflation to rise is allowed to continue, a dollar at the time of birth of a <span class="highlight">child</span> born this year would be worth ic by the end of his life, and at the time of his death average annual earnings would be $27m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no complaints from New South Wales in relation to the <span class="highlight">child</span> care Act because the Liberal Government - I will say this in its favour - had the wisdom to dump section 96 of the Constitution altogether and, under its <span class="highlight">child</span> care Act, to make grants directly to the organisations without using any State governments as a pipeline for those grants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>25m has gone into New South Wales for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres and we are dealing directly with local governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also makes allowance for financial assistance for certain persons outside Australia not qualified to receive an Australian social service pension and provides for payment of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, pensions and similar long term benefits to the credit of savings accounts with approved credit unions and also the payment of pensions and similar long term benefits to the credit of bank accounts, as has been the case with <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment since its introduction in 1941. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A class A widow or a supporting mother will receive a basic pension or benefit of $26 a week, together with a mother’s allowance of $4 a week and additional pension of $5 a week for each <span class="highlight">child</span> in her care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As all honourable members are well aware the rate of mothers allowance is increased to $6 a week if she has a <span class="highlight">child</span> under six or one who is an invalid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus a mother with 3 children over 6 years of age will now receive a maximum pension of $45 a week; this amount would be $47 a week if she were entitled to the higher rate of mother’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same rate of pension will be payable to a single age or invalid pensioner with children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A married pensioner couple will also qualify to supplement the basic married rate of pension for $45.50 a week by an additional $5 for each <span class="highlight">child</span> in their care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If she has no income affecting, a widow with one <span class="highlight">child</span> may have property to the value of $43,600, or $45,680 if her <span class="highlight">child</span> is under 6 years of age or an invalid requiring fulltime care, before her entitlement to widow’s pension is extinguished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At present <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment is paid either by cheque each four weeks or by credit to a bank account at 12-weekly intervals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed that payment of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment be made to the credit of savings accounts with approved credit unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Preparations will be made to introduce this new method of payment for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment later this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although initially it will be possible to pay only <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to credit union accounts, eventually the new provisions will extend to other payments under’ the Social Services Act which will include all pensions, supporting mother’s benefit, sheltered employment allowance and rehabilitation allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As honourable members are aware, a war widow may also receive a domestic allowance if she has a <span class="highlight">child</span>, including a student <span class="highlight">child</span>, or if she is 50 years of age or is permanently unemployable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am aware of a reported statement by  Dr R.  M. Howlett, officcr-in-charge of the genetics laboratory at Royal Perth Hospital which calls for the establishment of a genetics centre in Perth as a significant step in reducing the number of <span class="highlight">child</span> deaths from genetic disease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable gentleman examined the legislation of his own Government in relation to <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres he would find that his Government - we have followed suit - established a direct relationship with local governments, churches and any private organisations that set up <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, without using the mechanism of section 96 of the Constitution and without using the States as a post box. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>5m will have been committed to capital construction works for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres between April 1973 and 30 June 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, more than $lm has been spent in recurring grants and nearly $400,000 on research in the field of <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The base rate pensioners who have no other income and who need and deserve assistance, whether it be in the form of supplementary rent assistance or the payment of so much for each dependent <span class="highlight">child</span>, are the ones who are being hit the hardest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the present rate of inflation rents are being increased and it costs more to rear children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, there is the proposal to abolish concessional tax deductions for dependent children and with the savings thus made to substantially increase <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As mentioned, the savings in the first year which would be diverted to increase <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment would, according to Taxation Office calculations, be of the order of $240m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Disregarding this saving, this would mean that the total cost for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment would be of the order of $55Om this financial year if the proposal had been implemented for this period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In subsequent years savings from the removal of the taxation concession for dependent children will be of the order of $25m a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If average weekly earnings were to increase by 10 to 15 per cent in the same year then to increase <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment correspondingly would cost between $55m and $80m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While this sort of program of increases in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment seems to have attractions, the cost is such that further consideration of the proposals is needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been asked by a number of people the income effects of Professor Henderson’s proposals relating to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and the removal of tax concessions for various family income groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps it might be handy for purposes of the record if I indicate here the order of costs involved in increasing <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, for example by $1 a week for all children according to their place in the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable members will note, to increase <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for the first or only <span class="highlight">child</span> by $1 a week would cost nearly $100m and to increase <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment by this amount for all children, nearly $2 10m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 of the inquiry which recommends fundamental changes in the amounts of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to be paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It recommends payment of the amount of $1.50 for the first <span class="highlight">child</span>, $2 for the second, $4 for the third and so on up to $8 for the fifth <span class="highlight">child</span> and subsequent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A deep point of philosophy and even pragmatism is involved here because it can be well and truly argued that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> for different philosophical reasons should be higher than for, say, the second <span class="highlight">child</span> because quite often the first <span class="highlight">child</span> is far more costly to the family unit than the second <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite often the wife is forced to cease work and therefore the amount of income coming into the home on the birth of the first <span class="highlight">child</span> is suddenly decreased by one-third or more and there is also the initial expense associated with the birth of the first <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These include $9m for pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres; $1.7m for health services, of which $0.5m is for blood transfusion services and $0.7m for the school dental scheme; $lm for grants to the apple and pear and canning fruit industries; and $l.lm for assistance in relation to natural disasters in previous years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was then noticed that the house had caught fire and, before any effective means of controlling the fire was found, it was too late and despite all the efforts of the local people the unfortunate <span class="highlight">child</span> was burned to death. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only did the unfortunate family lose their youngest <span class="highlight">child</span> but also they lost all their furniture and household effects and in fact now have to start off again from scratch. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As usually happens in unfortunate cases such as this, everybody has rallied around to give them the maximum assistance, but all this assistance does not bring back the <span class="highlight">child</span> they have lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The house with the <span class="highlight">child</span> inside was burned to the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even the children of Australia are concerned about the tragedies of the Whitlam administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the interjection to which I have referred causes confusion for Hansard, I should state that it emanated as a cry from a <span class="highlight">child</span> in the public gallery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other anomaly which has caused some of this surplus has been the inability of single mothers in some States to have their dependant children included as beneficiaries under the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in Victoria the law allows single mothers to adopt their little children and they then become beneficiaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in that State of great enlightenment and progress, Queensland, from which we have heard much in the last day or so about enlightenment, we find that dependant children cannot become beneficiaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find that the <span class="highlight">child</span> must have a mark on it for life and that in the event of the death of the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s mother on whom it could be completely dependent it is denied, under the previous Government’s miserable scheme, the benefit for which his or her mother has paid out of her salary - in many cases a payment which could not be afforded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have published our policies on preschool education and <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out, finally, however, in view of the frenzy of the Country Party on this issue and a little earlier on the matter of the superphosphate bounty, that, for instance, the amount of $65m which will not be going to wealthy farmers after the superphosphate bounty ceases at the end of this year will be very handy to fund an adequate <span class="highlight">child</span> care program in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps that fact explains some of the opposition of the Country Party to proposals put at the recent Country Party conference with respect to <span class="highlight">child</span> care services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation governing <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres was introduced by the honourable member for Flinders when he was Minister for Labour and National Service in the McMahon Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Responsibility for the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act was transferred to the Department of Education and it is wholly unamended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, my impression would be that the majority of applicants to set up <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres are local government authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the children in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres are very young for any form of indoctrination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that their main concern is to help the parents who are working by looking after their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is not a scintilla of evidence that any of these <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, whether set up by local governments, churches or private charitable groups, have as their motivation any form of indoctrination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the illiteracy of handicap of which dyslexia is one aspect; the illiteracy of ethnic origin - the disadvantage the migrant <span class="highlight">child</span> might experience in trying to - handle the English language, or an Aboriginal <span class="highlight">child</span> might experience in trying to handle the English language; and the illiteracy of omission either by dropping out, not having a chance or poor or faulty teaching. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is found in children of all levels of intelligence, including the genius level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor is it caused by poor teaching, frequent absences from school, the absence of books from a home, the poor eyesight or hearing of children or emotional maladjustment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The sum of $395,000 is being spent on pre-school <span class="highlight">child</span> research - some of it in the area of the handicapped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the illiteracy of ethnic origin, the honourable member will recall that $5.25m was envisaged by the Commonwealth Government as being necessary for the capital works for migrant education so that classrooms could be built into which the children could withdraw for teaching in English. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the illiteracy of Aboriginal children, the honourable member will know that we have tried in the Northern Territory to establish literacy in Aboriginal languages where the parents have selected that course and it has been found over many years that that lends itself most effectively to transference to literacy in English. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a <span class="highlight">child</span> does his fundamental primary education in the language of the heart the transference to English is made easier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>First I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr Young)  and the honourable member for Henty  (Mrs <span class="highlight">Child</span>)  for the way in which they presented the Address-in-Reply tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would do this also by encouraging and establishing special facilities and procedures for those who cannot work full time or in normal office or factory hours, including <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities, supplementary after school facilities, staggered working hours, flexible time, part time and job sharing, the appropriate application of superannuation schemes and special retraining courses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How does one see that equity is maintained between a mother who goes out to get the $80 a week which she can when she is training, with her children looked after in <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities to be provided by the Government, and a mother who gets nothing from the Government because she prefers to stay at home and look after her children and believes that is what she ought to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The allowances involved are <span class="highlight">child</span> education allowances payable to servicemen posted to a new location, generally to cover extra costs associated with the continued education of a <span class="highlight">child</span> at the former location, separation allowances, livingout allowances, living away from home allowances and retention of lodgings allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a need for the national Government to involve itself, not by directly overseeing urban development projects and becoming a giant landlord and developer, but by providing additional funds to local government for capital works programs such as day and <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, recreational and care centres for children both after school and during holiday periods; parks, gardens and flora and fauna reserves; family and community counselling facilities, particularly among migrant communities; library and recreational facilities; health and welfare centres, including family planning and infant health centres; sewerage and drainage schemes; and road, street and bridge works. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I also offer my congratulations to those honourable members on the Government side who moved and seconded the motion for the adoption of the AddressinReply, the honourable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr Young)  and the honourable member for Henty  (Mrs <span class="highlight">Child</span>). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Difficulties often arise in such cases over the care of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very undesirable that pre-school children be left in crowded, unstimulating surroundings, as often happens when they are left with neighbours or at cheap <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Worse still are cases where children of 2 and 3 years of age are left strapped in cots all day in bare rooms while parents are out at work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When such children get to school they come home to an empty house or have to roam the streets until parents return. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the aim of the Australian Labor Government is to provide such centres for all children, free of charge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adequate controls will have to be provided to maintain the standards so that children attending them will benefit, while at the same time allowing enough flexibility to cater for local needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An important factor to note here is that these preschool centres should be seen as places where children are educated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The socialisation process of learning to mix in a peer group, the discovery of the physical properties of common materials and objects and the learning of physical manipulative skills not only can be encouraged at the pre-school age but must be encouraged if the <span class="highlight">child</span> is to stand a chance of developing to its full potential as a person later in life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The situation of women in the employment field and the provision of <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities are only one part of the social question of the relative roles of the 2 sexes in the society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this respect I say that I have never ceased to be grateful that I came into this world in time to experience as a mere <span class="highlight">child</span> the final years of the infamous depression of the Thirties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Secondly, in the policy speech last April reference was made to our plans to embark on a major pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> care program at a cost then estimated at $130m in this financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will, of course, fully honour the commitments that we have already entered into under the interim pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> care schemes, and which alone could call for an outlay of about $34m in this financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The problem with this expenditure is that in some States local government - I dp not want to release in advance the details of the Coleman report, which in respect of the sum of $130m proposed has envisaged a very big role for local government - is not empowered to spend money on pre-schools or <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Bearing in mind that law” suits for divorce and <span class="highlight">child</span> custody are private legal matters solely within the jurisdiction of the appropriate courts in both Austria and Germany, as they are in Australia, the degree of assistance that the Australian Government and Australian embassies can offer is limited and must of necessity be less extensive than that sought by the various organisations and persons who have interested themselves in  Mrs Weber’s  case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the Minister’s answer to the honourable member for Isaacs, will the Minister acknowledge that he has before him numerous requests for both subsistence expenditure and capital expenditure for new and existing <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres and pre-schools, particularly a number from my own electorate with its large number of 2- income earner families? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the attention of the honourable member to the fact that $13.5m worth of approvals for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres were made last year under the legislation of the former Government and that the whole of that money was not taken up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the honourable member for Diamond Valley  (Mr McKenzie)  and the honourable member for Henty  (Mrs <span class="highlight">Child</span>)  both pointed out, the National Interest Division is one for which the funds obtainable, however they are obtained, can be obtained only by resolution passed by both Houses of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some good promises were made, including one concerning a <span class="highlight">child</span> care program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I remind the Minister for Social Security that on 1 May this year, speaking about <span class="highlight">child</span> care programs, he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need for such a program is emphasised by the fact that there are at present in Australia about 1.3 million children of pre-school age and that, for more than 1 in 4 of these children, there is no parent at home during working hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As powers in respect of adoption and related <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare matters are retained by the State governments under the Constitution, consultation with State governments is necessary and a national conference has been arranged for 24 and 25 July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A school is disadvantaged if it needs to put on extra teachers to teach English, but otherwise it has been found that because of the amount of backing in Italian and Greek homes, for instance, that a <span class="highlight">child</span> gets - the headmistresses and headmasters of New South Wales schools have said this to me - migrant children in very many cases are among the least disadvantaged because their motivation to education is so good, and that almost invariably the disadvantaged children are <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw to his attention the fact that only a few days ago we heard a serious contribution in this House when the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  informed us that the Government’s promises in relation to <span class="highlight">child</span> care and the abolition of the means test on pensions would not be implemented in accordance with the timetable that had formally been proposed and that these reforms were being postponed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If in his electorate, as there is in mine, there is much concern about <span class="highlight">child</span> care I am surprised that he would even enter into this debate and make comments that would indicate that <span class="highlight">child</span> care is of little consequence in his electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that if the Government was looking for other expenditure to prune in order to be seen to be responsible it would have found something other than the grants for <span class="highlight">child</span> care benefits and <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I remember also a Press release by the right honourable gentleman on 1 May saying that the Liberal-Country Party coalition offered $20m for both <span class="highlight">child</span> care and retraining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition Parties cannot even make up their minds about the difference between pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The average expenditure by the LiberalCountry Party Government, which preceded the present Government and in which the right honourable gentleman was the final Treasurer, on pre-school education and <span class="highlight">child</span> care was S5m a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the sub-heading ‘Progressive Social Services’ is a promise of ‘<span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for the first <span class="highlight">child</span>, without reduction of the basic wage’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in answer to a question - the one that led to a personal explanation by my colleague, the Leader of the Australian Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  - insisted upon stating that he had read a document of mine which said that an amount of $20m would be spent by a Liberal-Country Party Government for both <span class="highlight">child</span> care and retraining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the upshot we undertook to spend $20m on <span class="highlight">child</span> care and retraining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  said that none of the $130m will be spent on <span class="highlight">child</span> care and retraining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It does not concern the program of <span class="highlight">child</span> care services, if I may use that compendious title, as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  delivered the policy speech for his Party on 29 April of this year he gave the clearest of undertakings regarding <span class="highlight">child</span> care services - and I use that term ‘<span class="highlight">child</span> care services’ for the sake of convenience to cover both preschool education and <span class="highlight">child</span> care in the sense that we understand it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> care services will be subsidised with parents contributing to the cost according to their means, the main thrust of the program in the first years being to assist disadvantaged children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is estimated that the cost of this program in the first year - a program of vision and imagination based on a compassionate understanding of the needs of the <span class="highlight">child</span>, the parent and the community - will be $130m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How is it that the honourable gentleman was able to say on 29 April that the recommendations made concerning <span class="highlight">child</span> care services throughout Australia were based on the recommendations of these 3 reports? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>500,000 children will benefit from Whitlam’s <span class="highlight">child</span> care programs by 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In a statement in this House on 1 1 December 1973 the Minister said that in the case of both <span class="highlight">child</span> and pre-school facilities there are serious inequalities in existing services and the need for action is urgent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman will recognise that in the <span class="highlight">child</span> care program at present I am implementing legislation of the Liberal and Country parties, which envisages the establishment of expensive and quite elaborate <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable gentlemen opposite will recognise that in their legislation they left the initiative for the development of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres to local groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have under construction and approved 262 pre-schools and 122 <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>honourable member who is getting excited about repudiation  -  SI 2m was approved for pre-schools and $ 13.5m for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to talk about accelerations I remind the honourable gentleman that expenditure on the pre-school area and the <span class="highlight">child</span> care area in the last five years of his Government was $8.35m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As long as I am responsible for this matter - I am adamant on this - there will be qualified staff in pre-schools and adequate staff in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not going around being rigid by saying that everybody in a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre has to have a degree from a university or any sort of formal qualification like that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members wish to know my philosophy on this matter - it relates to the expensiveness of staff, perhaps, or at least the time taken to get the staff - it is this: It is unfortunate that some of the justifiable agitation for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres and pre-school institutions assumes the eclipse of the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To be adequate a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre needs to give a <span class="highlight">child</span> responsiveness, appreciation and predictable warmth - the role of a mother for a <span class="highlight">child</span> whose mother is not able to assume a mothering role at least for some part of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some local bodies can be talked into it but if it is merely a question of their willingness honourable members will find that in some areas where <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres are least needed there is a local government body willing to establish them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In some of the most advantaged areas like Toorak there are a lot of disadvantaged children and a lot of disadvantaged people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have mentioned 122 <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres and 262 pre-school centres under way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am speaking of the elaborate <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres envisaged by our predecessors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Department regards 23 of the 85 applications for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres as urgent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lm in addition to other expenditures on <span class="highlight">child</span> care, which brings it up to a total of $44m which is the figure I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of commitments made by our predecessors we are working through local and voluntary groups at the moment on the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres and, because pre-school is not compulsory, we are working through locally inspired individuals as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has nothing to do with the establishment and organisation of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This discussion that the Opposition has introduced deplores the repudiation by the Labor Government of its public undertaking to commence a full scale pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> care program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a gimmick that undoubtedly had a strong appeal and influence on the result of the past 2 elections, despite the fact that it is now obvious that no coherent or workable policy had been developed that would allow for a successful commencement of this program and which not only recognised the needs of the children but could also operate within the bounds of our economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> care policies were dangled like a carrot on a stick before the nation - a nation that because of the disastrous economic initiatives of this Labor Government now finds that changes have taken place that have transformed the care of our pre-school age children from an isolated, individual problem into a subject of national concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention these 2 factors because this influx of women into the work force has made the <span class="highlight">child</span> care problem visible in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we analysed the need for <span class="highlight">child</span> care solely in terms of the increased number of working mothers, we would run the risk of the inadequate considerations of the range of possible solutions to our problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can become all too easy to say simply that places must be found to park the children while the mothers are at work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a solution leaves out the critical ingredient, that is, the needs of a growing <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The circumstances of our rapidly changing society give the issue of <span class="highlight">child</span> care a wider dimension than the mere need for baby sitting services while mothers are at work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we discuss pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> care programs we should be showing a humane concern for a program of national commitment that is both feasible and capable of full development, not one that has stirred the hopes of the nation and now has become a frustrating exercise in political expediency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The motion deplores the callous manner in which the Government has seen fit to sacrifice the interests of women and their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, the <span class="highlight">child</span> care area is not the only one in the list of promises which have been broken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The $134m <span class="highlight">child</span> care program, they decided, was dispensable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> care programmes, of course, are a philosophical consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If another ministerial squabble develops over <span class="highlight">child</span> care as it did at the Australian Labor Party Conference in 1973, it will be some time yet before the objectives and attitudes of the Government are known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The essential test of whether either any party’s words are genuine, is the amount of money the politicians have said that they are going to be prepared to spend on the important issues, and if you just take <span class="highlight">child</span> care and retraining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Liberal-Country Party have said: ‘$20m we will set aside next year for <span class="highlight">child</span> care and retraining.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>$130m the Labor Party has promised for an adequate <span class="highlight">child</span> care program which would benefit every <span class="highlight">child</span> in the community, whether that <span class="highlight">child</span> is at or in somebody else’s care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government by its actions and its promises has let down the Australian people generally and our women and children in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When politicians use an emotional and sensitive area like <span class="highlight">child</span> care and exploit it for their own ends, they deserve the nation’s strongest censure and condemnation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I agree with the Opposition that education and particularly <span class="highlight">child</span> care are matters of great public importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tabling of these reports reflects the high level of interest taken in <span class="highlight">child</span> care and other education matters by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am particularly pleased to note this newfound interest in <span class="highlight">child</span> care by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A last desperate act by that Government, taken almost as a recognition of its sins of omission in the previous 23 years, occurred in the dying days of the 27th Parliament in 1972 when action was taken to pass legislation relating to <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us not forget that earlier this year the Opposition parties in order to force an unnecessary election were not afraid to reject supply in which money was appropriated for <span class="highlight">child</span> care purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No concern was expressed for <span class="highlight">child</span> care at that stage when the Opposition parties were intent on forcing this Government to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>After he had pointed out that the then Gov ernment subscribed to the great need for <span class="highlight">child</span> care, 18 months after it had made a promise in an election campaign - not a couple of months later which is the position we are in now - the then Minister said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last year the Government appropriated about $10m for pre-schools and $8.3m for <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities, but we were not able to spend all the money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Interestingly enough - I do not think this should be forgotten - it was a Liberal Government which first introduced <span class="highlight">child</span> care legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If those members opposite who sit to your left,  Mr Chairman,  will some day understand that they do not have a divine right to govern but that they have to earn it they might return to this side of the House a lot more swiftly than they are likely to return at the moment because the speeches that have been given here today will not stand the analysis of any secondary school <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will recall that a few weeks later when the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  announced the deferment of the Government’s <span class="highlight">child</span> care proposals, the same Opposition set up a phoney outcry against this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The total cost of the <span class="highlight">child</span> care program as promised in the election campaign of May last was almost equal to the loss anticipated to be incurred by the Australian Post Office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would seem that the Opposition ‘s priorities then were that postal charges should be lowered at the expense of a total <span class="highlight">child</span> care program because it cannot have it both ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government has under consideration the question of <span class="highlight">child</span> care services and facilities on a national basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-45-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Officers of the Department of the Capital Territory are in regular communication with the relevant authorities in the field of <span class="highlight">child</span> care and with the various local community organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-45-15">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fact is that in 1972 the previous Liberal Government gave an allowance of $50 per primary school <span class="highlight">child</span> and $68 per secondary school <span class="highlight">child</span> in a regional Catholic school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next year as a result of the Budget the allowance will be increased to $163 for each <span class="highlight">child</span> in a primary school and $260 for each <span class="highlight">child</span> in a secondary school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Budget proposal that receives my instant support, not only because it was a matter of policy of the Opposition during the last election campaign but also because it is a necessary national responsibility, is the proposed introduction of a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance of $10 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears to me that parents or guardians of children who need constant care and attention require assistance to meet circumstances of personal costs and devotion not encountered by parents of a <span class="highlight">child</span> not afflicted by severe handicaps, irrespective of that <span class="highlight">child</span>’s age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The former Government made no attempts to increase <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments to give encouragement and support to our basic unit- the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Huge expenditure by the Government on <span class="highlight">child</span> care and pre-school facilities in the future could well prove to have been unnecessary if such incentive was available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only thing in the Budget that will benefit you is the increased aid for <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will break down the traditional distinctions between occasional care and regular care, between pre-school education and <span class="highlight">child</span> minding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again, I am sure all honourable members who have had the problem of latch key children within their electorates will welcome and endorse the scheme for the care of the children of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the decisions which have been taken by this Government have been not only significantly beneficial to the people of today but also they will be of great benefit to the people and especially to the children of the future because we believe in equality of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do not believe that 85 per cent of the children who go on to university should necessarily come from the professional classes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way in which to bring that about is to do what the Karmel Committee report has recommended and what this Australian Government has put into operation, that is, to give every <span class="highlight">child</span> an equal opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As Treasurer the present Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  said: ‘We will spend $5m on <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget provides for $75m to be spent on giving children throughout Australia an equal opportunity of pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> care and so that the women of Australia who want to go to work will have somewhere decent to leave their children where they can be looked after by professional people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If more is to be provided for defence, more for the States, more for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and <span class="highlight">child</span> care, more for restoration of rural subsidies and reductions in taxation and all the rest of it, where is the huge cut back to fall? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What centres are subsidised under the recurrent grants provision of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act, where are the centres located, what is the nature of the subsidy and how much does each centre get. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many parents of isolated children are now in the position where an allowance of $150 simply will not enable them to keep a <span class="highlight">child</span> at a high school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With his indulgence, I would like to incorporate in Hansard a table which shows the average reduction for education expenses per <span class="highlight">child</span> by grade of taxpayer ‘s net income for the financial year 197 1-72. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite obviously if the concession is available, as it should be- and I do not for a moment suggest it should not be- to parents of children in the public and in the private education systems equally, surely the amount of deductions claimed by parents of children in public schools will be inevitably considerably less than those claimed by parents of children in private schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things that is going to heighten the sense of discrimination in some parents of children at private schools as a result of the Government’s decision is that whereas $150 might in some cases be sufficient to provide for the cost of excursions and books and extras, if parents have only one or two children at a public school, that $150 is going to go like that even if a <span class="highlight">child</span> attends the cheapest and most frugal independent school in the outer western suburbs of Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a time when both parents could claim tax deductions for the same <span class="highlight">child</span> as long as their <span class="highlight">child</span>’s educational expenses exceeded twice the amount of the limit on the taxation deduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his Budget Speech the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  announced the Government’s intention of increasing additional payments for children of pensioners and beneficiaries by 50c a week to $5.50 a week, raising supplementary assistance and supplementary allowance, i.e., rent allowances for pensioners and sickness beneficiaries, by $ 1 a week to $5 a week, and increasing double orphan’s pension by $1 a week to $11 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer also announced the proposed introduction of a new allowance called handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This allowance will be payable at the rate of $10 a week to parents or guardians of physically or mentally handicapped children who are cared for in a family environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Single or widowed pensioners, including supporting mothers, who are eligible for supplementary assistance and have, say, 2 children, will receive a maximum of $5 1 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The total amount payable is increased to $53 a week if the pensioner or supporting mother has the custody, care and control of a <span class="highlight">child</span> under 6 or an invalid <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Double orphan’s pension is paid in respect of a <span class="highlight">child</span> both of whose parents, or adoptive parents, are dead or where one is dead and the whereabouts of the other are unknown to the claimant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pension has proved of considerable assistance to people caring for children who, in the circumstances outlined, have permanently lost all contact with their parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>State welfare departments make financial assistance available to people caring for children who are under State control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Double orphan’s pension is akin to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and it was never envisaged by the Australian Government that it should relieve the States of expenditure in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker, I would now like to give the House some details of the Government’s proposals relating to the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rate of the allowance will be $10 a week and it will be paid where, because of the nature and severity of the handicap, the <span class="highlight">child</span> requires constant care and attention in the family home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allowance is designed specifically to assist parents and guardians who have a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 years of age requiring constant attention and who, for reasons that all such persons will understand, prefer to provide this attention at home rather than place the <span class="highlight">child</span> in an institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is recognised that most persons who have a severely handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> in the home incur additional expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This new allowance should be seen in the context of the broad program of education, training and general welfare for handicapped children being developed by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parents or guardians who care for a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> at home will be encouraged to take full advantage of the facilities that are being made available under the general welfare program and the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s attendance at a day school or training centre will not affect eligibility for payment of the allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allowance will be paid as an addition to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and will therefore be available either by cheque at four weekly intervals, or paid into a bank or similar account each 12 weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is estimated that some 20,000 children will qualify for the allowance and that the annual cost will be approximately $ 10m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, unmarried Australian girls who give birth to a <span class="highlight">child</span> while residing overseas are required to serve a period of 5 years ‘ residence in Australia on their return before qualifying for supporting mother’s benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A woman with a <span class="highlight">child</span> of her own or a <span class="highlight">child</span> who entered her care before she became a widow is a class A widow and attracts payment of a mother’s allowance and additional pension for the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A class B widow is one who has no <span class="highlight">child</span> of her own or has no <span class="highlight">child</span> who entered her care before she became a widow and who is not less than SO years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A woman who ceases to be a class A widow because her qualifying <span class="highlight">child</span> turns 1 6 or ceases to be a full time student, may become a class B widow if she is at least 45 years of age at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Class B widows at present receive the same basic pension as class A widows but they do not receive the mother’s allowance or the additional pension for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand an unmarried woman may be granted an age pension at age 60 or an invalid pension and, in addition, receive additional pension for each <span class="highlight">child</span> in her care, and guardian’s allowance irrespective of whether she is the mother of the children and irrespective of the date the children entered her care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore proposed to enable a mother’s allowance and additional pension for children to be payable to class B widows who have the custody, care and control of any <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions relating to the new handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowances will come into operation on 30 December 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present legislation will ensure that the qualitative improvements which the Government sought to achieve in schools throughout Australia when it adopted the recommendations of the Karmel report, ‘Schools in Australia’, will still be achieved and as a result every <span class="highlight">child</span> attending a primary or secondary school in this nation will benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increases are now proposed in the rates of pensions payable to the children of veterans who died from service-related causes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed to increase by $1.20 to $10.45 the pension payable to each such <span class="highlight">child</span> who is in the care of its mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where the <span class="highlight">child</span> has neither mother nor father, the rate will be increased by $2.40 to $20.90. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This allowance is paid to a widow who has a dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> or children, including fulltime students, a widow who is over the age of 50 years, or one who is unemployable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allowances paid under the soldiers ‘ children education scheme to students undertaking secondary education, or industrial or agricultural ‘training, will be increased by about 13 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increases will range from 45c to $2.25 and the new rates from $3.70 to $18.80 depending on the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s age and whether it is necessary to live away from home to undertake study. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall, about 4,500 children are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there will be an increase in the addition to pension payable in respect of children in the custody, care and control of the pensioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The addition in respect of each <span class="highlight">child</span> will be increased by the Bill by 50c to $5.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last census some figures were taken out on families where husbands did not have wives and there were dependent children under 21 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were 12,000 families where there was one such dependent <span class="highlight">child</span>; 7,000 families where there were 2 such dependent children; 3,500 families where there were 3 dependent children; 1,500 families where there were 4 dependent children; and 1,000 families where there were S or more children thus dependent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In round figures there were 25,000 families and 50,000 children involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means that there are 75,000 Aus- tralians-25,000 of them adults, 50,000 of them children- who are thus suffering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that here and now we should make widowers with dependent children eligible for pensions on the same basis as widows with dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a one <span class="highlight">child</span> family it is $100 a week; 2 children $110; for 3 children $120; 4 children $130; and 5 children $140. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that anybody would really say that a 5 <span class="highlight">child</span> family on $140 a week is doing very well indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he is working he has to have some kind of housekeeping arrangements unless some of his children are old enough to sustain the burden of housekeeping themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures are somewhat higher than the honourable member for Mackellar outlined to the House and, of course, there were some changes last night For a widower with one <span class="highlight">child</span> the income limit would be $107 a week, with 2 children $124, with 3 children $141, with 4 children $158, with 5 children $175. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would be many of them with 5 or 6 children on an income of much less than $100 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although it may seem unusual in relation to estimates for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to be discussing matters relating to <span class="highlight">child</span> care, such is now the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  has assumed the responsibility for matters relating to <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I intend to refer specifically to the appropriation of $187,000 to establish an interim committee for the Children’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> care undoubtedly is a very important matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a great and growing concern in the community that <span class="highlight">child</span> care should, firstly, be made available to those people who have a real need but ought to be available also to any woman and to any family wishing to have facilities for minding their children if those people wish to be employed or wish to exercise some freedom of choice in regard to working or undertaking other activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not complaining that moneys are allocated for <span class="highlight">child</span> care or for <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note that in the Budget an appropriation of $75m was made for <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that in 1972 the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act was introduced into this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Telopea Church of Christ was establishing a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre with a grant pursuant to this Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that on 22 July it was indicated that the proposed programs for <span class="highlight">child</span> care promised in the April policy speech of the Prime Minister could not be introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Special Minister of State  (Mr Lionel Bowen),  who is now in the chamber presumably to deal with these matters, made a ministerial statement on 19 September in which he detailed the reasons for the establishment of the Children’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What he said was that an interim committee would be formed ultimately to establish the Commission which will take over responsibility for administering all existing commitments in the areas of <span class="highlight">child</span> care and pre-schools, and will immediately set to work to enable a substantial beginning to be made on the new program no later than January 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the attention of honourable members to a report titled ‘Social Issues News Statement’ by the Brotherhood of St. Laurence commenting on the <span class="highlight">child</span> care proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The creation of another commission outside existing departments will further fragment social policy making and the administration of <span class="highlight">child</span> care and family welfare programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The trend should be to integrate and not fragment family and <span class="highlight">child</span> care programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government proceeds on its present course of action, it will fragment policy making and administration, create confusion and slow down the introduction of urgently needed, locally-based <span class="highlight">child</span> care services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention the first <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre that was to have been established in my electorate in the Dundas Valley at Telopea, a housing commission area which certainly has self-evident and widely acknowledged social problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This worthy group of people that is endeavouring to open a <span class="highlight">child</span> care facility in January of next year has found that it is almost impossible for a church working in the area with limited facilities to be able to gather together the funds necessary for it to commence operations from the completed centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Reverend J. Bacik for the management committee of the Telopea Church of Christ <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Centre has pointed out, it is not possible in the present economic climate for the organisation to go to its bank and to borrow funds for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe there is no way that a committee or a commission not directly responsible to this Parliament can act fast enough when matters are referred to it for report in this way, and bring about a situation where the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre in Telopea and the many others that are seeking to be operational next year will be able to function and be functioning to meet these urgent needs that are evident to us all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They occur in his electorate as they do in my electorate and in many other electorates across the country where expanding urban populations and increasing numbers of working mothers are creating the demand for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the allocation of funds for faculties such as <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres is determined by Government departments under direct ministerial control, the complaint of the Opposition is always that political patronage is being exercised and will become the basis on which facilities are made available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, we have made sure that the allocation of funds for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres and pre-school centres will be determined on an expert and impartial basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The foreshadowed establishment of the Children’s Commission, the appointment of the interim committee for this Commission, and the initiation of the national pre-school education and <span class="highlight">child</span> care services program is a momentous step forward in the social history of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honorable members will be aware that no fewer than 365,000 Australian children under 6 years of age have mothers who are engaged full time in the work force and that there are places available in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres at present for no more than 34,500 of those children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While it is most difficult to obtain precise pre-school education statistics for Australia as a whole, it seems certain that the position is still one in which there is a pre-school place available for fewer than one in every four of the children whose parents would wish to take advantage of it if it were there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the aim of the Government to see within half a dozen years that there is a place in a pre-school centre free of charge for every <span class="highlight">child</span> whose parents want to take advantage of it and that there is a place in a <span class="highlight">child</span> care facility of one kind or another available for every <span class="highlight">child</span> whose parents want to take advantage of it, at a charge related to income - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am always a little surprised to hear members such as the honourable member for Parramatta complain that undertakings such as the <span class="highlight">child</span> care facility to which he referred a few moments ago will be delayed when, under the government in which the party that he supports last participated, the prospects of such an organisation being financed at all would have been very remote indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government moved in the matter of pre-school education and <span class="highlight">child</span> care at all and that, indeed, it was only in the last year of office of the former Liberal-Country Party Administration that a <span class="highlight">child</span> care program was launched. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we recognise on the one hand that there is an enormous number of mothers in this community who are obliged to go out to work by economic circumstances and who have a pressing need for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, equally there is an enormous number of women in the community who would simply welcome an occasional break away from their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why we are emphasising the provision not only of full time day care centres but also of occasional day care centres, of play groups organised on a voluntary basis under expert guidance and supervision, and a variety of other forms of <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mothers who do not want to go out of their homes to work provide care for the children of mothers who do go out of their homes to work on the basis that the charge is $12 a day for each of the children who are minded and that the sum of $12 a day for each <span class="highlight">child</span> is paid to the mother providing the care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Henty  (Mrs <span class="highlight">Child</span>)  mentioned the distribution of funds to local government bodies under the Australian Grants Commission scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret very much that my education as a <span class="highlight">child</span> at a number of schools, both country and city, was sadly neglected in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I rise to speak about the Department of the Special Minister of State and particularly in regard to <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Commission or other documents related to the <span class="highlight">child</span> care area, I find that the terms used seem to conflict at times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pre-school care, <span class="highlight">child</span> care, long-day care, play groups and many other terms are used to describe the functions of the care of young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, I would suggest that we use the term ‘<span class="highlight">child</span> care’ to apply as it generally has and traditionally does to long term, long-day <span class="highlight">child</span> care, where parents may leave their children at a centre from early in the morning until reasonably late in the evening, certainly for 5 days a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two years ago there were no members of that organisation, and I believe there are now 1 5,000 children involved in play groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, I would refer him to a recent initial survey done in the Blacktown-Mount Druitt area of Sydney where it was definitely indicated by mothers in a random survey that 90 per cent of mothers would like sessional care of their children or a play group situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their concern for their children and the young Australians that they are fostering is the same no matter where they live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like the Minister to keep this point in mind when referring to the Commission any matters in the <span class="highlight">child</span> care area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The project care book that has been prepared has an innuendo in relation to long-day <span class="highlight">child</span> care that it is something that will take the children, look after them and deny the parents the responsibility that is rightly theirs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These surveys, done in 1971, indicated that 96 per cent of the women would prefer to stay at home with their children, certainly until they reach the age of three and many said until they reach the age of five. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is moving in the direction of total day care for children I would suggest that it consider its position very carefully and look to Hungary and Czechoslovakia for some guidance in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Comparatively recently Hungary had 50 per cent of its children in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Hungarian Government is now using television advertising to encourage parents to stay at home with their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is providing a form of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to encourage parents to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are also problems with the children who have been through this system for some years who are now teenagers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government and society has found that the problems of children who have difficulty in the fixation of a family way of life are really great indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It no longer encourages mothers to leave their young children in centres provided for them but encourages them to stay at home with their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be seen from the project care booklet that a round figure for on-going costs per <span class="highlight">child</span> seems to be $1,000 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My investigations indicate that the capital expenditure could be something like $2,500 per <span class="highlight">child</span>, which amounts to something like $250,000 per 100 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore you have a capital cost of $250,000 per 100 children, an on-going cost of something like $ 1,000 a year per <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would draw the Minister’s attention to the situation of our established system of <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would suggest to him that if new initiatives are to be taken m the field of <span class="highlight">child</span> care they cannot be taken at the expense of existing systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be retained a freedom of choice and a certain amount of flexibility so that parents have the right to decide, to make a choice between alternate forms of <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It related to expenditure on <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this occasion, however, the sum of $75m has been set aside for the setting up of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, with the emphasis on education, in the areas of greatest need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So on the question of <span class="highlight">child</span> care honourable members opposite ought to appreciate greatly what the present Government is doing for the women, children and families of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> care was mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What did those who sit opposite do about <span class="highlight">child</span> care during the 23 years they were in government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where did you ever allocate $1 for <span class="highlight">child</span> care? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allocation you were referring to related to a <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act which was associated mainly with assisting people in industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore you will find that when we have the report as to what is needed in <span class="highlight">child</span> care, as the honourable member for Casey  (Mr Mathews)  said, the figure will be enormous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 365,000 children in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us make it clear that the program for <span class="highlight">child</span> care will be an effective one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has to be the care of the <span class="highlight">child</span> throughout the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be experimental projects as to what is the best way to look after the <span class="highlight">child</span> because the <span class="highlight">child</span> is at various stages of developmentperhaps under 2 years of age and perhaps going to pre-school for part of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many people who are experienced in the practicality of looking after children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is one of the criticisms of one of the first reports, because it had mainly as its significance the establishment of buildings, land and training and there was not a great deal in the way of results from the point of view of <span class="highlight">child</span> care for the need that now exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where did the Liberal Party have in its platform any undertaking to do anything about <span class="highlight">child</span> care? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have spent a fair bit of time on the question of <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we have any claim to credit it is in the fields of <span class="highlight">child</span> care, education and local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me make it clear that the <span class="highlight">child</span> care program is not the subject of criticism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In the very limited time available to me it is obviously not possible to canvass all the issues involved in the Australian Capital Territory, but in view of the speech made by the Special Minister of State  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  a moment ago, I want to refer specifically to the <span class="highlight">child</span> care program before I get on to the main topic of my speech, which will be housing in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to make it quite clear that the <span class="highlight">child</span> care program - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to discuss for a moment the <span class="highlight">child</span> care program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to discuss <span class="highlight">child</span> care in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will indeed, because under legislation introduced by the former Government and which the present Government is enactingand such legislation indeed applies to the Australian Capital Territory- there are 3 criteria which determine the eligibility for assistance under the <span class="highlight">child</span> care program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that the centre applying for’ assistance has to give preference to children in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second criterion that has to be met is that the centre must be open to all children and not merely children of any particular category such as employees of a factory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third criterion which has to be observed in getting assistance under the <span class="highlight">child</span> care program is that the organisation applying for it must be a non-profit organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a disgraceful performance by the Special Minister of State to try to allege that the program of <span class="highlight">child</span> care was other than on the lines I have just outlined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>14) Will <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities continue to be provided for women after they have completed training and entered the work force; if so, will such <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities be extended to all working mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-55-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have studies been undertaken into the reaction of mothers, who choose to stay at home and care for their children, to the provision of Government <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities to women who are being paid allowances to undertake training; if so, will they be provided with an equivalent grant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-55-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (15) I suggest that the honourable member directs these questions to the Minister whose portfolio covers <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-55-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That goes for the original pension scheme; it goes for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment; it goes for things like aged persons’ homes, sheltered workshops and all the other services that we have introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on the Opposition side regard as one of the greatest areas of social need the men, widowers and deserted husbands who have been left to care for young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know why the Government is resisting our move because it is bad enough for a <span class="highlight">child</span> to lose a father, it is bad enough to have the breadwinner leave the family, but when the <span class="highlight">child</span> is deprived of the mother surely the area of need is as great as or even greater than is the case in the other circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill raises the additional payment for each <span class="highlight">child</span> of a pensioner by SOc a week to $5.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill introduces a handicapped children’s allowance of $10 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This amount will be payable to the parents or guardians of a mentally or physically handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> cared for in a family environment and requiring constant attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the claim form is received by the Department it will be referred to an Australian Government Medical Officer who will examine the <span class="highlight">child</span> and certify whether or not in his opinion the <span class="highlight">child</span> is handicapped to a degree that qualifies for the payment of the allownace <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In practice the medical test for severe handicap will be on the basis that if the condition remained unchanged the <span class="highlight">child</span> would be likely to qualify for invalid pension on attaining 1 6 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One wonders too how an autistic or hyperactive <span class="highlight">child</span> would be regarded under that test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would think that it would be doubtful whether an autistic or hyperactive <span class="highlight">child</span> would be considered ‘sick’ enough to qualify for an invalid pension at the age of 16 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But those of us who have had experience with such children know that a family with such a <span class="highlight">child</span> quite often desperately needs the kind of assistance that is envisaged in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One wonders in those cases whether the parents or guardians of such children will be disqualified from receiving benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also seeks to extend the Mother’s allowance and the additional pension for children to Class B widows who have the custody, care and control of any <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also provides for the payment to handicapped children undergoing vocational training as part of their rehabilitation of new rates of allowance comparable to those paid under the national employment and training scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, has the Minister considered the proposition raised in the joint Opposition Parties policy document entitled ‘The Way Ahead’ that the maternity allowance for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> should be doubled to $60? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But they go ahead budgeting, and if a <span class="highlight">child</span> arrives whether planned or not, that first <span class="highlight">child</span> imposes a massive burden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What about the costs involved with a first <span class="highlight">child</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we should be considering people in that situation and that we should at least double the maternity allowance for the first <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report recommended massive changes in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-We have the question of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment under deep study. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are its thoughts on <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister, instead of smirking or smiling, should note that action in the area of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment has been recommended by the Henderson Committee and by all responsible social welfare organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Henderson Committee has indicated that a great number of low income earners on the breadline with a wife and several children to support and who are suddenly sacked can experience deep hardship in the week following their sacking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member gets terribly upset when we refer to the past, and I do not blame him for that, because he was a member of a government which for 23 years did absolutely nothing about the maternity allowance, about <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for the first and second children which had not been adjusted since the previous Labor Government was in office in the 1 940s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Victoria, for State wards cared for by foster parents this Government has provided an orphan pension of $10 which is in the nature of a <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment type payment to those people to assist with the care of orphans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the Victorian Premier reaching his hand into the pockets of these children and stealing the $10 like a thief in the night and his colleagues in other States are doing exactly the same thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One other area in which it seems to me that action should be taken is the area of assisting widows with children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not appear to me that sufficient cognisance is taken of the very high expenses involved in children attending high school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a person depends on a pension of any kind, the <span class="highlight">child</span> is very severely disadvantaged, even though educational and other benefits may be provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a social welfare area and some serious examination should be undertaken of the means by which such children can be placed on the same basis as other children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, let me take the raising of the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance from $5 to $5.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So even with this new 50c, the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance in terms of purchasing power will be far below what it was when we were in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was interested to hear, I think it was the honourable member for Corio, talking about family endowment for the first <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party in its policy would have given nothing and it fought us tooth and nail when we proposed to endow the first <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first one is the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the allowance which, as honourable members will be aware, is $10 a week to the parents of guardians of physically or mentally handicapped children who are cared for in the family environment, will meet with wide approval. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the estimate was made that there could be 20,000 handicapped children in Australia who would qualify for this allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though we do not welcome the fact that there are this number of handicapped children, I think one of the side benefits of this allowance will be to bring many of the handicapped children in the community more out into the open and let the Government know about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the general advantage of the benefit is the side advantage of a means of registration of handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps it is necessary- because there has been a lot of worry by parents of handicapped children about just what will be the eligibility requirement for this allowance- to emphasise that attendance by the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> at a day school or day training centre will not affect the eligibility for payment of the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main basis of assessing eligibility will be that the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s handicap is such that constant care and attention are necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The payment is designed to assist parents who have to provide constant care for a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 years, at which age he or she might be expected to qualify for an invalid pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about a handicap at a level which, without any improvement in the <span class="highlight">child</span> by the time he reached 16 years, would qualify him for an invalid pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">child</span> would be eligible for an invalid pension at 16 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The idea of the allowance is to assist those parents who prefer to provide attention for the <span class="highlight">child</span> at home rather than place him in an institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Extra equipment, special clothing or whatever, may be needed apart from the necessity perhaps of having a more specialised baby sitting service than might be needed for the normal <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  said in his second reading speech, the allowance should be seen in the context of our broad program of education, training and general welfare for handicapped children being developed by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parents who care for a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> at home will be encouraged to take full advantage of the facilities already available in the community and being made available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make it clear that attendance of a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> at a day school or day training centre will not prevent his or her parents being eligible to receive the allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main basis of assessment of eligibility will be that the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s handicap is such that constant care and attention are necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The administrative procedures for dealing with claims for the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance have not been finalised in every detail, but I think for the benefit of those who are concerned about whether they might be eligible it would be worth while putting on record a broad indication of the policy pattern that it is intended to adopt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As this form will be checked against <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment records and payments will be related to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, personal details will be kept to a rninimum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The parent may be asked to supply information concerning the nature and extent of the care and attention that is provided in the home and the name and address of any school that the <span class="highlight">child</span> is attending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was outlining the procedures that will apply for the payment of the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be necessary to supply the name and address of any special school or day training centre that the <span class="highlight">child</span> is attending and the names of medical practitioners who have recently attended the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This perhaps will enable the grant of the allowance to be made even without actual examination of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The medical practitioner might be contacted directly to assure the Department that the <span class="highlight">child</span> would be eligible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The form, when received by the Department, will be referred to an Australian Government medical officer who will examine the <span class="highlight">child</span> and certify whether in his opinion the <span class="highlight">child</span> is handicapped to a degree that would qualify the parent for the allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In practice, the medical test to determine severe handicap will be satisfied if the handicap is such that if the condition remained unchanged the <span class="highlight">child</span> would be likely to qualify for an invalid pension on attaining 16 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following approval, the claim will be referred to the finance authority and the amount of the allowance will be added to the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment being paid in respect of the <span class="highlight">child</span> and, of course, the parents will be notified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An important thing that I think indicates the Government’s general attitude is that where a claim is rejected on the ground that the severity of the disability is not sufficient to qualify the <span class="highlight">child</span> for the payment of the allowance, the claimant will be advised of this and also advised at the same time that an appeal against the decision may be lodged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In very severe cases that have no hope of improvement the medical officer might well authorise the payment of the allowance until the <span class="highlight">child</span> reaches 16 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the main the Australian Government medical officers who will conduct medical examinations of handicapped children will have had experience in examining claimants for the invalid pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has covered one of the major anomalies by introducing the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, I congratulate the Minister on introducing the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This extends to provisions which allow the parents of handicapped children to escape from the onerous duty they have of caring for these children, in some cases virtually around the clock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Help of this kind enables parents to get away from the home and away from the tension that many of these children create. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I, like other members, welcome the advance made with the allowance for handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had in both my professions, as a medical practitioner and as a politician, a great deal of experience with handicapped children and their parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt, however, that a fair amount of modification will have to be made because if this allowance is to fulfil its purpose of keeping handicapped children at home in the care of their parents, who must have the full capability of giving the proper care, not only the children, but also the families of the children will have to be assisted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the honourable member for Denison  (Mr Coates)  referred to some of the strains that occur in the families of handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Somewhere along the line we will have to try to assess not only the handicap of the <span class="highlight">child</span>- this is the starting point- but also the disability of the family, the alteration that a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> makes to their way of life and the conduct of their household, and the effect it has not only on the mother and the father but also on the other children in the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">child</span> could have a learning defect which, if not detected early, creates a psychological or even psychiatric or behaviour problem requiring not only remedial education, but also remedial treatment in specialist clinics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Social Security indicated in his second reading speech that we should consider the new allowance in the context of a broad program of education, training and general welfare for handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Denison mentioned that the parents of the children who attended day centres would not be disqualified from receiving the allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the family is to be able to maintain the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> at home, there also has to be the faculty for them to have a break for a holiday, of no matter how short a duration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Hotham, who is the spokesman for the Opposition on this subject, referred also to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said, without quoting figures, that it was the intention of the Opposition if it were elected to government to increase the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment rate substantially. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Hotham went on to say that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment would be taxed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we are going to have means tested <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and taxed <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>has the Prime Minister any knowledge whatever of any proposals on a government level to apply a means test to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to this proposal about a means test on <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, I have never heard of it before and I do not want to hear of it again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of a 13 year old boy or girl who is run over on a pedestrian crossing by a drunken driver and receives a permanent total incapacity there will be no benefits at all under this Bill until that <span class="highlight">child</span> reaches the age of 18 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said already, it is important that under a new scheme the guilty are not advantaged at the expense of the innocent, that the drunken middle-aged driver is not advantaged at the expense of the innocent <span class="highlight">child</span> whom he maims for life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect therefore is that the small maimed <span class="highlight">child</span> of 5 gets nothing immediately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only when the <span class="highlight">child</span> attains 18 years of age is a small amount of $42-odd a week paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely that is a gross inequity in itself for under the present common law system the <span class="highlight">child</span> would be entitled to substantial lump sum payments as soon as they were assessed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I agree with the honourable member for Wentworth, I think it was, who made a point about a <span class="highlight">child</span> who is injured as a baby and will get relatively little. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-33-70">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Henty  (Mrs <span class="highlight">Child</span>),  for instance, made great play of the proposition that the Liberal-Country Party Government built office blocks instead of houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is pertinent to note that the honourable member for Kingston  (Dr Gun)  spoke a little earlier, as did the honourable member for Henty  (Mrs <span class="highlight">Child</span>)  and the honourable member for Diamond Valley  (Mr McKenzie). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I can bring a personal element into the debate, I can remember the time when I was a small <span class="highlight">child</span> in the western country going to various gougers meetings, small mining group meetings and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of life is that we have in the Government benches a gathering of people desperately out of touch with what is going on in this countrypeople who take the view that to send a <span class="highlight">child</span> to a State high school and to spend $160 is a violent exercise in extravagance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other point I made was the further conscious objective of this Government to make education accessible to all children, wherever they live, whatever the socioeconomic condition of their parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To achieve this objective we have provided increased assistance for the <span class="highlight">child</span> whose family lives in an isolated area far removed from normal school facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had the strong people of the Caucus saying that the decision of the Cabinet to reduce the amount of taxation deduction for education from $400 to $150 per <span class="highlight">child</span> was wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government wants to sock the rich, to stop rich people sending their children to independent schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not the rich people; it is the people who send their children to State schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know how many honourable members in this chamber have children at school, but try to send your <span class="highlight">child</span> to a state school and keep the expense down to $150 a year and see how you get on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course many people who choose to send their children to independent schools will suffer very greatly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people who will suffer are those who make sacrifices to send their children to these schools, who do without a great number of things so that they can send their children to independent schools- not all of them sectarian schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are numbers of schools in Sydney and right throughout Australia where parents, not on sectarian basis, have spent a great deal of time and effort establishing experimental courses, looking at different ways of education for their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>May I remind honourable members of the identification of problems that exist in the pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> care sphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention the question of malnutrition and disease affecting the brain capacity of the <span class="highlight">child</span> before birth because malnutrition does not occur only in areas such as the Kimberleys. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The abandoning of the free milk scheme did not affect a large number of school children nutritionally, but there were areas where to many children the free milk provided their breakfast for the day and where their educational performance was affected by the abandonment of the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the Preston North East State School in my electorate a large number of the children come from socio-economically depressed families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Just last week a report from the Preston North East State School stated that of the 900 children in the school 400 suffered from head lice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Committee of the Parents’ and Friends’ Association of St. Leo’s College, Box Hill, wishes to register a strong protest on behalf of parents, at the decision announced in the recent Federal Budget, to reduce allowable taxation deductions for education expenses from $400 to $ 1 SO per <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Many parents in my electorate send their children to such schools as Wesley, where fees have risen for the third term this year to $5 10 per term for forms III to VI. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This amounts to $1,530 per annum in fees alone for one <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add to this uniforms, equipment, books, fares and all the other extras and it is costing parents well over $2,000 per annum to send one <span class="highlight">child</span> to such a school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to recent Victorian Government Budget papers, the total taxpayer support for every <span class="highlight">child</span> attending a government school is approximately $1,230 per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every parent who is forced by the policies of this Government to withdraw a <span class="highlight">child</span> from a non-government school and send him or her to a government school is going to cost the taxpayer an extra $1,230 per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How much cheaper and more logical to subsidise the fees parents pay at nongovernment schools, to help to keep these fees down to a reasonable sum, thus enabling the average family to send its children to one of these schools should it so choose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only 2 months or so since the Budget, yet already non-government schools are finding children being withdrawn or enrolments being deferred or cancelled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it would be one which would retain the right of the children to be educated at the school of thenchoice and at the same time would treat all children equally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would enable our dual system of education to continue to function; under the system each <span class="highlight">child</span> would be treated equally by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it cost the taxpayers $1,230 to educate a <span class="highlight">child</span> at a government school then the government would simply issue a voucher to this value for every <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All taxpaying parents would thus receive the same contribution towards their children’s education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If by the mother working, or by other sacrifices, parents preferred to spend more on their children’s education than the Government voucher allowed, then it would be their prerogative to do so and naturally they would have to meet the added costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I looked around the school at the facilities there and I could well understand why parents who have no choice but to send their children to government schools are concerned about the amount of money this Government is giving to independent schools, because the facilities at this particular school were far in advance of anything we can find at government schools in a similar area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet this school was a category G school, which means that whereas when the Labor Party came into office it was receiving $104 per <span class="highlight">child</span> from the per capita grants this year it will be receiving from the Government $ 141 per <span class="highlight">child</span> and next year can expect to receive $230 per <span class="highlight">child</span> in per capita grants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am delighted also to see the innovation of an allowance of $10 a week for handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the people who care for handicapped children at home face a tremendous amount of extra expense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they want a day off or if the family wants a picnic and cannot take the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> they have to pay baby sitters and it is costing a lot of extra money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As it is, a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> brings enough grief to the family without the added burden of very great extra expense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Henty  (Mrs <span class="highlight">Child</span>)  endeavoured to make out a case that this Government in its 2 years in office has been the only government that has ever done anything in the field of social welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does he expect centres for young children to continue to operate without funds during this period, despite the Prime Minister’s undertaking in August that States would receive recurrent grants similar to those under the existing program? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I make the point that a <span class="highlight">child</span> who is handicapped in the way that I am speaking of and who emerges from the school system does not suddenly have a magic wand waved over him so that the problem is cured, and you have an adult without the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question of special education facilities for exceptional children, whether they be handicapped or specially gifted children, exercised the mind of the Australian Labor Party for some years before it came into office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I pointed out then the need for at least double the output of teachers for slow learners, who comprise about 3 children in every 100- quite a small group when compared with the group we are discussing today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I also pointed out the need for generalists in special education, the need for specialists in education for the various categories of handicapped learners and gifted children, including slow learners, disturbed, maladjusted and autistic children, physically handicapped children in various categories, gifted children and specific learning defect sufferers and the culturally deprived, including migrants and Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The committee of the parliamentary Labor Party in September 1972- again before the Labor Party was in government- made certain proposals on schools commissions, for which we had agitated for some years, to provide equality of opportunity, to investigate inequalities, to recommend programs, to advise the Government, to be the organ of intelligence and insight, to sponsor and conduct research into all aspects of education, and indeed into all aspects of <span class="highlight">child</span> care and welfare, including the economic, mental and moral well being of children, to sponsor experimental schools and programs, to educate teachers, assist student teachers, foster in-service and continuing education, to consult pre-school authorities, town planners, pediatricians, <span class="highlight">child</span> psychiatrists, to provide for <span class="highlight">child</span> minding and pre-school centres and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill also proposes amendments to the depreciation provisions to make it clear that expenditure on facilities used in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres provided by employers for children of their employees are to qualify for depreciation deductions on the same basis as facilities provided for employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are many instances where local governing bodies have possibly over-stretched their resources and have endeavoured to do too much with too little; but most modern local governing bodies are required to provide services such as libraries and <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres and recreational facilities like sporting ovals and swimming baths; in many instances they undertake the operation of meat abbatoirs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) expresses its belief that there should be no discrimination of any kind attached to an ex-nuptial <span class="highlight">child</span> and that the word ‘illegitimate’ which has been used to date to describe children born out of wedlock is totally inapproriate and should be removed from all Commonwealth legislation and from common usage, and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>is of opinion that, as a matter of priority, legislation should be introduced to protect the rights of ex-nuptial children and, in particular, insofar as the Commonwealth Government is concerned, to remove the word ‘illegitimate’ from all existing Commonwealth legislation and to amend existing Commonwealth legislation to ensure that ex-nuptial children have the right to participate in the same benefits and entitlements that any other <span class="highlight">child</span> in the community is able to receive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The circumstances facing ex-nuptial children and the lives our society allows them to lead are subjects that should be understood widely and debated frequently, if need be until the concepts of the motion I am putting are accepted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But regrettably this needs to be done because unless we specifically direct our attention to exnuptial children, we will continue to assume that they need no special help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But in the midst of those concerns we have largely ignored the needs of the third person- the <span class="highlight">child</span> born to an unmarried mother, a widow, a separated wife or to a married woman who has a relationship with a man who is not her husband. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this motion is to ask the community to reassess its attitudes that it has adopted towards ex-nuptial children, to familiarise itself with the difficulties that it may have caused ex-nuptial children and to recognise the harm this has done to the community itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly the law has discriminated against ex-nuptial children, particularly in areas such as the right to participate in the estate of its natural father or to establish as a right the identity of its father. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should make the point that when I use the word ‘<span class="highlight">child</span>’ we must remember that it is a <span class="highlight">child</span> while it is young, but that same <span class="highlight">child</span> carried that attitude right through adulthood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Australia we know very little about how the ex-nuptial <span class="highlight">child</span> is faring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no longitudinal studies at all that I know of that have been conducted in Australia to determine the welfare and the progress of the exnuptial <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But quite clearly the reason there have been no such longitudinal studies in Australia is that no funds have been provided for the purpose and largely because the community, knowing its attitude, has felt that it would be a gross intrusion on the rights of the person to inquire into what has happened to the ex-nuptial <span class="highlight">child</span> as it has grown older. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the passing of that Act, Bills have been introduced by the Tasmanian, South Australian and Victorian Governments along basically similar lines incorporating in each case a schedule which amends existing legislation to remove the word ‘illegitimate’ where it occurs and to ensure that an ex-nuptial <span class="highlight">child</span> is not excluded by way of definition from participating in benefits and entitlements that should be available to him or to her. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one instance of Commonwealth legislation which is discriminatory in this sense, I mention the Commonwealth Superannuation Act where the definition of ‘<span class="highlight">child</span>’ includes an adopted <span class="highlight">child</span> but does not include an ex-nuptial <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The findings regarding pregnancy management suggest that mothers-to-be of ex-nuptial children take much less care of themselves and consequently of the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In all aspects of ability and attainment the ex-nuptial group did significantly less well than the <span class="highlight">child</span> born in marriage or the adopted <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We must accept totally the principle that the long-term welfare of the <span class="highlight">child</span> should be the first and paramount consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This principle should be the basis of determining all policy and practice for all children without differentiation as between them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Making children suffer because of actions taken by others which are certainly beyond the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s control, it not even existing at the time of the complained of behaviour, is cruel and ill-fitting a society which should adopt such attitudes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All authorities involved with current programs in <span class="highlight">child</span> development in Australia now emphasise the need to integrate programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This necessitates the formation of a central unit, which will be the role of the Children ‘s Bureau. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As my Leader has said, the exnuptial <span class="highlight">child</span> is disadvantaged because of circumstances completely beyond his control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole connotation of that word applies to the <span class="highlight">child</span> as if it is the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s fault that he has been born under these circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many suggestions have been made of alternative terms that could be used, terms such as ex-nuptual <span class="highlight">child</span>, natural <span class="highlight">child</span> and <span class="highlight">child</span> of a single mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is an appropriate time for the Parliament to debate and to pass this motion because there is a growing incidence of natural children who for a variety of reasons are born out of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can think of no worse social custom than the parents of a <span class="highlight">child</span> who is conceived as a result of their actions when half drunk in the back of a motor car getting married because they feel that to avoid social stigma they are forced to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As society becomes more sophisticated the number of children born out of marriage will increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the custom whereby unmarried women who become pregnant and do not wish or are not able to have an abortion or a termination quietly have the <span class="highlight">child</span> adopted by some agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That custom too is changing in that more and more single mothers are keeping their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not have the statistics of the percentage of unmarried mothers who kept their children 10 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I am astonished today to notice that 40 per cent of single mothers now keep their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This point would not have had so much importance had the children been formally adopted under the old style. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must be unanimous that the <span class="highlight">child</span>- whatever the faults, if there are any, of the parents- is completely blameless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Leader mentioned the disadvantages that are suffered by children born out of marriage- the Commonwealth Superannuation Act, the property inheritance where ex-nuptial children have to sue and fight to contest their natural rights; the embarrassment that one has to go through in paternity tests; and the housing difficulties encountered by single mothers with children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That sort of thing also rubs off on the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of these disadvantages must, as my Leader suggested, have an enormous psychological impact on that <span class="highlight">child</span>, whose only sin is that he was born of parents whom he could not choose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not now time that we turned our attention to the <span class="highlight">child</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can be in complete agreement with the final proposition put by the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp)  that it is indeed time that the community and this Parliament, containing as it does the various political parties, should turn its attention to the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is very proud of what it has managed to achieve in the short time that it has been in office in terms of doing away with discrimination- where it has had a measure of success- because discrimination exists in a whole range of areas, as the honourable member for Hotham pointed out when he directed his remarks to the ex-nuptial <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one directs one’s attention to the exnuptial <span class="highlight">child</span> one sees the same determination being extended there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the whole point is that when one comes to the question of the ex-nuptial <span class="highlight">child</span> one is in complete agreement with everything that was said by both the previous speakers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) expresses its belief that there should be no discrimination of any kind attached to an ex-nuptial <span class="highlight">child</span> and that the word illegitimate which has been used to date to describe children born out of wedlock is totally inappropriate and should be removed from all Commonwealth legislation and from common usage, and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>is of opinion that, as a matter of priority, legislation should be introduced to protect the rights of ex-nuptial children and, in particular,  insofaras  the Commonwealth Government is concerned, to remove the word illegitimate from all existing Commonwealth legislation and to amend existing Commonwealth legislation to ensure that ex-nuptial children have the right to participate in the same benefits and entitlements that any other <span class="highlight">child</span> in the community is able to receive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Briefly, this legislation provides for increased tax liabilities for the mining industry, the imposition of taxation on certain forms of fringe benefits, the specific allowance of deductions for depreciation on <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities, a reduction of the limit on deductions for educational expenses, the deductibility of mortgage interest payments, a reduced level of the special deduction allowable to life assurance companies, a rebate of dependants’ allowances for low income families; and technical amendments fo the principal Act with respect to dividends payable from Papua New Guinea, the relief of taxpayers in cases of hardship and provisional tax for 1974-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clauses 1 1 and 12 of the Bill provide for the expenditure of plant and facilities used in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres provided by employers for their employees to qualify for depreciation deductions in the same way as facilities provided for employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the decision to introduce this tax deduction in no way compensates for the deferral of the pre-election promise to embark on a major pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> care program estimated to cost $130m in 1974-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst we support the increases provided in the Budget for education, we believe that the decision to reduce the deduction does not take into account that the benefit was available in respect of expenses incurred by the family for the individual <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can any supporter of the Government assert with any truth at all that with the possible exception of a few of the preparatory grades, $150 will go anywhere near covering the educational expenses in a year for a <span class="highlight">child</span> at primary or secondary school? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the Minister’s remote area allowance, this is a very definite thrust against remote area children, because there are no secondary schools or primary schools in many isolated areas and as a result children have to be sent to city-based private schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think the parents of every school <span class="highlight">child</span> are finding more and more that the expenses of educating their children are rising, for even though we have a socalled free education system there are still many items of expenditure which people are required to pay in respect of the education of their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The most significant innovation in the Bill is the provision for a compulsory conference with a welfare officer between the parties to custody or divorce proceedings to discuss the welfare of a <span class="highlight">child</span> of the marriage, with a view to resolving any points of difference between the parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I assume, however, that the Honourable Member is seeking information concerning the concessional deductions allowable under the heading of education expenses where a young <span class="highlight">child</span> attends an institution which provides a form of education appropriate to the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s age in addition to care and supervision while the parent is at work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-81-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even though most <span class="highlight">child</span> care institutions are not ‘schools’ as that term is ordinarily understood, the Commissioner of Taxation has been able to accept that part of the fees paid qualify as education expenses where certain conditions are satisfied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-81-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the relevant tests are satisfied, and provided the <span class="highlight">child</span> has reached the age of three years, a deduction is allowed in respect of that part of the fees which could reasonably be regarded as attributable to the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s full time education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-81-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No deduction is allowed where the <span class="highlight">child</span> is under three years as this age is the minimum age at which a <span class="highlight">child</span> is considered capable of absorbing formal instruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-81-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the extent to which full time education is provided by an institution which also engages in the care and supervision of young children can be determined only in the light of the facts of each particular case, the Commissioner is unable to lay down arbitrary rules for general application. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-81-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without birth control it was absolutely essential to have a morality and a code of ethics that protected the unwanted <span class="highlight">child</span>, that ensured that all children were born into an atmosphere of love and understanding- the birthright of every <span class="highlight">child</span>, the essential atmosphere for that <span class="highlight">child</span> to develop its personality and to grow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point has been made already today that a <span class="highlight">child</span> or children living in an unhappy house- I use the word house’ carefully,” I do not use the word ‘home’can be tormented to a far greater degree than a <span class="highlight">child</span> or children who live in a one-parent family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I also take up a point which was made by the honourable member for Henty  (Mrs <span class="highlight">Child</span>). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The honourable member for Henty  (Mrs <span class="highlight">Child</span>)  was towards the end of her speech rather mouthing a few political slogans, but the rest of her speech contained some interesting matters that deserve to be looked at. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision of maternity allowances, widows’ pensions, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, unemployment, pharmaceutical, sickness and hospital benefits, medical and dental services (but not so as to authorise any form of civil conscription), benefits to students and family allowances: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under present arrangements to be eligible for a loan of Home Builders’ Account moneys, the average gross weekly income of the main breadwinner of the family, exclusive of overtime and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments, during the 6 months immediately prior to applying for a loan must not have exceeded 95 per cent of the Commonwealth Statistician’s estimate of average weekly earnings during the preceding December quarter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here, insofar as Home Builders’ Account applicants are concerned, this variation in the method of computing the needs tests will have the effect of raising the limit at the present time for a family with up to 2 children from $117.80 to $136.80. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are, firstly, that full and proper recognition be given to the status and rights of a woman as wife and mother; secondly, that there should be full and proper protection of the wife and children in the event of the dissolution of a marriage; and, thirdly and lastly, but not least, that there is need for children to be reared and cared for by a present parent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not found in the Bill, nor have I heard from any honourable member, any suggestion that children will be forcibly taken away from their parents, although I accept that there may be now, and no doubt will be in the future, those rare and terrible circumstances in which a <span class="highlight">child</span> must be separated from its parents for its own safety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no provision anywhere in this Bill, however it is construed, which would force a working class wife, with children under 18 years of age, to work in order to support herself or to live solely on the pension, provided her spouse is employed and earns sufficient income to enable him to contribute to the family’s support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Working class women will receive greater protection than those with education and training as they are less able to assist themselves, because work in unskilled employment for a small remuneration may not permit them to obtain adequate paid childminding facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the same token, a female doctor, for example, would not be forced to work if she chose to remain within the house to care for the children, but she would be expected to work when the youngest <span class="highlight">child</span> attained 18 years of age, provided that the woman’s age and state of health enabled her to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I caution that it is not my view that there is a need for children to be reared and cared for by a present parent in all cases, although I believe it is most desirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My wife and I have both undertaken professional obligations and we believe that it is in the interests of the upbringing of our <span class="highlight">child</span> that both parents be allowed to pursue their careers notwithstanding the fact that it may not be the best for the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that that <span class="highlight">child</span> would be worse off if the mother or father were required to be at home, certainly distressed and I believe taking out that distress upon the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A party to a marriage is liable to maintain the other party to the extent that the first-mentioned party is reasonably able to do so, if, and only if, that other party is unable to support herself or himself adequately, whether by reason of having the care or control of a <span class="highlight">child</span> of the marriage who has not attained the age of 18 years, or by reason of age or physical or mental incapacity for appropriate gainful employment or for any other adequate reason having regard to any relevant matter referred to in sub-section 75(2). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My continuing worry in relation to the power and operation of the Family Court is to ensure that its decrees and orders, particularly with regard to welfare and custody of children and maintenance of property, are observed and that responsibility for compliance with and observation of the court’s decrees remain a function of the court itself, or one of its agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That same concept does not apply in the testator’s family maintenance provisions because under those no testator can deny the existence of his widow and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are to be applauded and their efforts should be strengthened, but we cannot run away from the fact that the statistics clearly show an unhappy part of society that could be helped, although it is doubtful, by guaranteeing that in matrimonial causes one party will be found guilty and the other party will be entitled to some recompense by way of money, custody of the <span class="highlight">child</span> or the like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Family Law Bill certainly will eliminate fault or the conduct of parties as a ground for divorce but it will not eliminate an open examination of the conduct of the parties in what are the most heartrending results of a divorce- the custody of the children of the marriage and access to them by either partner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In moving to establish the Children’s Commission the Australian Government has recognised that changing social patterns have put considerable pressures on families with infant and school-age children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These changes include a growing number of families where both parents work, and of single parent families, as well as a frequently increasing sense of isolation affecting women looking after children at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through the Children’s Commission the Australian Government will provide assistance to a variety of organisations, groups and individuals for programs including full day care, family day care, pre-school education, emergency care, occasional care, before and after school and vacation care, playgroups and any other <span class="highlight">child</span> care activities in accordance with demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The functions of the Commission set out in clause 5 of the Bill embody the philosophy of providing comprehensive, co-ordinated and integrated services for children and include the concept of providing priority to those in greatest need, special needs of particular groups- and flexibility in the provision of services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, of course, is consistent with the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act 1972 which was introduced by the McMahon Government just prior to the December 1972 elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill will ensure that what we are already doing in the provision of services for children will be the subject of continuing parliamentary scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Curriculum Development Centre, once established, accept the broad concept of curriculum as including the totality of experience which a <span class="highlight">child</span> undergoes during his schooling? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the danger for the school <span class="highlight">child</span> and for the community at large is that those responsible for curriculum development might adopt an attitude that there is only one way of proceeding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not see the logic in dictating that a <span class="highlight">child</span> in Bourke, for example, must do exactly the same course or course of subjects as one would find a student doing in, say, Sydney or Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite obvious that the percentage of students who ultimately go to universities does not justify this presumption and for that reason I would earnestly suggest to the Minister for Education  (Mr Beazley)  that there is a real need to try not only to relate curricula development to the vertical developmentnamely, from the time children first go to preschool right through to the time they finish school- but also to try to relate standards between States to the actual opportunities which are being offered to students and standards of educational attainment in terms of specific subjects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s overall condition of upbringing would be as free of restriction owing to the circumstances of his family as public action through the school could make it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another example drawn to my attention was that when children are taken into the city to see the zoo or the museum teachers cannot get them out of the Central Railway Station because the children are playing on the escalators which they have never seen before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no good teaching children in an environment which is in complete isolation from the environment in which they are expected to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have mentioned, the need to increase individual opportunity for every <span class="highlight">child</span> is very real. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the responsibility of the educationists to prepare a <span class="highlight">child</span> for present and later life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view, some people make the mistake of preparing a <span class="highlight">child</span> for later life without concentrating also on the fact that the <span class="highlight">child</span> is a living soul in the present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, one of the things we have to get over is the legacy of the past, the external examination ridden system of education we have had in this country whereby a <span class="highlight">child</span> in Bourke has to sit for the same terminal examination as does the <span class="highlight">child</span> in Sydney, Goulburn, Taree or wherever it may be in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not much authority was devolved on the regional or local groups of schools for the children who attended them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the word ‘curriculum’ educators refer to the whole range of learning experience which a <span class="highlight">child</span> undergoes during his schooling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Access to technical and further education by women can be enhanced by providing more in the way of appropriate physical and <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities, by arranging flexible timetables and by eliminating prejudice against their entry into manual trades. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time there should be no pressuresin fact by taxation and other policies we should be reducing the pressures- which lead women to want to enter the work force when they have children to look after, particularly children under the age of five. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the end of a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s school career, whether it be terminated at fourth form, sixth form or some earlier stage, parents seem in many cases to look at everything else before they look at technical education and, if everything else fails, to say: ‘We had better try to see whether he can do a trade or some kind of certificate course’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When one fills out forms relating to births one has to give give exactly the same information as one gives to other government departments when one is applying for the maternity allowance or <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In joining with the honourable member for Hotham, I say that there are many underprivileged areas in this country, underprivileged from lack of galleries, lack of libraries, lack of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, all the matters that go to make a proper quality of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are 85 000 children between the ages of one and five years who are left at home by themselves while their parents are at work because there are no <span class="highlight">child</span> care or kindergarten centres near their homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat: Which proposition would the electorate choose: Selling $4 billion of Australian assets or printing $ 1,700m in order to make sure that the economy is maintained at a reasonably productive level in order to ensure that the facilities so long denied education, <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare- one can go on- are supplied to the community? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If she has no income affecting, a widow with one <span class="highlight">child</span> may have property to the value of $54,000, or $56,080 if her <span class="highlight">child</span> is under 6 years of age or is an invalid <span class="highlight">child</span> requiring full time care, before entitlement is extinguished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government proposes to enable <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, double orphan’s pension, handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance and age, invalid and wife’s pension, widow’s pension and supporting mother’s benefit to be paid to the credit of savings accounts with permanent building societies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Initially only <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment will be paid to building society accounts but the other benefits will be paid in this manner as soon as the necessary administrative arrangements can be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When the debate on this Bill was held on Wednesday, 16 April, the honourable member for Henty  (Mrs <span class="highlight">Child</span>)  made a great point of saying how local authorities were happy with the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are more and more trying to lobby for such things as <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres for women workers and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one man, one woman or one <span class="highlight">child</span> dies because of the weakness of this Government, through its inept and incredible belief in doing nothing to upset the victor of tomorrow, we will have let ourselves down badly and we will have committed our own crime against humanity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to  Mrs Joan  <span class="highlight">Child</span>, the honourable member for Henty, who wrote a letter on 1 May 1975 to the ‘Moorabbin Standard’, a local newspaper that circulates extensively and almost exclusively in her electorate, in my electorate, the electorate of Isaacs and to some extent the electorate of Holt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Signed (Joan <span class="highlight">Child</span>) Member for Henty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mrs <span class="highlight">Child</span>,  because obviously she has had a lot of complaints from pensioners that they have not received the increase in pension, has resorted to the paltry, mean, untrue device of saying: ‘Well, the Bills have been passed by the Houses of Parliament but the reason you have not got your increases, dear pensioners, is that the Liberal and Country Party senators went home early’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I shall remove that restraint from myself and suggest to  Mrs <span class="highlight">Child</span>  that she will guarantee herself to be a oncer in the Parliament if she continues to tell deliberate untruths which she knows to be misleading, as I am sure the reading of that letter into the record indicates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill also provides for an increase of $1.50 a week for dependent children of pensioners and supporting mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This increases the amount for each dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> to $7 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The overall increase for a single pensioner with 2 children will be $8 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new policies in respect of widows or supporting mothers with one <span class="highlight">child</span> and no property affecting will mean that such a person will now be able to receive other income to a higher level without losing her entitlement to a widow’s pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I have listened with interest to the apology by the honourable member for Henty  (Mrs <span class="highlight">Child</span>). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Initially this will apply only in respect of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an $11 difference in direct benefits received by the 2 groups- $9 if there is not a <span class="highlight">child</span> under 6 years of age involved- but a very significant difference exists also in the application of the respective means tests on allowable earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the recognition of de facto wives and the provision for exnuptial children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beds in repatriation hospitals were unused while many patients outsidecivilians as well as wives and children of exservicemen who were looking for hospital accommodation were not able to receive it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be an extension of benefits to children of ex-servicemen and women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">child</span> happens to be in full-time education the benefits will continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During recent years much public attention has been focused on the need for more effective policies relating to the care and education of the preschool <span class="highlight">child</span>, but those who have been most vocal have more often than not had a special interest in only a single aspect of the total problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, many have rightly wanted to see an expansion in the availability of pre-school education, whilst others have been more concerned to press for the provision of a greater number of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The former group place emphasis on the educational needs of children, especially those in the 3 to 5 year old age group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The latter are anxious to overcome the problem of the care of children whose parents need to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tendency to distinguish between the care of the pre-school <span class="highlight">child</span> and the education of that <span class="highlight">child</span> has led to an unfortunate narrowing of public awareness and national concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the distinction has often hidden the importance of special consideration being given to the needs of the very young <span class="highlight">child</span>, the <span class="highlight">child</span> 3 years of age and under. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is now a growing public recognition and expression of the view that there is no ideal substitute for home and family life for the young <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At its 1974-75 annual conference the New South Wales Federation of Infant School Clubs called upon the Government ‘to ensure that no pre-school <span class="highlight">child</span> is deprived of his or her mother’s care for financial reasons, especially in the first 3 years ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most Australian families either choose to care for their pre-school age children especially those of 3 years of age and under, or would like to be able to make that choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major objective of any <span class="highlight">child</span> care policy should be to make this possible for those who, through economic and social pressure, are now unable to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must concentrate our national energies and resources not only on creating new day care facilities but also in a wide-ranging community approach to <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must endorse the trend to family orientation of <span class="highlight">child</span> care by strengthening the capabilities of families with measures designed to improve their social and economic conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To do this we must recognise that there are a wide range of economic and social policies which, whilst not being <span class="highlight">child</span> care programs per se, influence the way in which children are cared for and by whom; their mothers or a substitute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such matters as taxation policies originally designed for a nation of single income families or taxation concessions and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and other benefits which have lost their real value are matters that are in need of urgent attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much legislation discriminates against the normal 2-parent family and, in addition, places 2 -income families in an advantaged position when compared with those families where the wife and mother stays at home to care for her children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More and more people are starting to realise that in both the long and the short term it is intolerable to have a situation where mother and <span class="highlight">child</span> are deprived of mother care solely for financial reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This burden can be overcome in 2 ways: Either by the mother, irrespective of the ages of her children, going to work, or by significant tax reforms so that the current discrimination against the single income family is removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such suggestions included consideration of voluntary income splitting of the incomes of husband and wife; the restoration of concessional deductions for dependent spouses and dependent children to realistic levels; the restructuring of the tax scale on an overall basis; an increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment; and the restoration of the deduction for education expenses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These and many other proposals, such as some form of family income maintenance or a mothers’ allowance, are deserving of detailed study and appraisal in an attempt to design a policy for the care and education of the pre-school <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because of the whole wide range of matters that affect the development of the young <span class="highlight">child</span> that the Opposition proposed the establishment of a children’s bureau under a minister of community development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If families are to be given the opportunity of providing adequate home based care for their young children, measures with both direct and indirect consequences must be introduced to ensure that a real choice is available where today no real choice exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This can be done in a wide variety of ways, including the encouragement of play groups and toddlers groups which provide opportunities for social interaction of mothers as well as their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres available for occasional use, the suitability and availability of playgrounds together with the provision of community amenities such as libraries and toy-lending services, can also provide valuable support to a mother engaged in the full-time care of a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will, however, always be those children for whom substitute care must be provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Education at a seminar held at the Australian National University in 1974 said that he believed that adequate <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres need to give a <span class="highlight">child</span> responsive appreciation and predictable warmth of the type that would be available in the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to be hoped that in expanding the number of available places in <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres through local government and other community groups adequate recognition will be given to the role of the private <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres which to date have provided more than 70 per cent of care facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A pluralistic approach should be followed and the Australian Federation of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Associations and its constituent members should be given appropriate recognition and encouragement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such schemes should take their place among the whole range of <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities and not be seen as a magic formula in looking after children who are away from their parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would have liked to find in the Bill greater emphasis both on the need for research into the care and education of pre-school children and on the importance of evaluating the effect of those programs which no doubt will be supported by the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In providing support we think that money should be made available through the States as is the case in the fields of primary and secondary education, and that the Bill should include a provision requiring the Commission to work in close consultation and cooperation with the States in the development of comprehensive <span class="highlight">child</span> care and education programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Organisations which have developed a distinctive style in the provision of <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities or education for the pre-school <span class="highlight">child</span> should not, through the imposition of strings, be required to conform to a standard method of providing care or pre-school education, provided of course that the services offered though diverse in character meet acceptable minimum standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the Children’s Commission Bill 1975 with deep personal pleasure as already I have seen the hope and enthusiasm which the proposal has given rise to within the electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a measure that has met with public acclaim and, despite efforts by opponents of the Government to suppress the knowledge of the benefits to be gained, those concerned with <span class="highlight">child</span> care and those in public life have been able to spread the message widely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the funding of day <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres in Western Australia has been restricted in one sense by the election promise of the existing State Government to commence pre-school centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hoped that out of a promise made during the fervour of an election a sound and sensible State <span class="highlight">child</span> care system will evolve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is ironical that the very people who decry Australian Government participation have to rely in the main on the Australian Government for funds in this area of <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already the Interim Children’s Commission has approved day care centres in areas of need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hoped that the socioeconomic surveys will show where needs exist and that the appointment of catalysts or, in common terms, research and community <span class="highlight">child</span> care guidance people, will produce suitable recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An aspect of <span class="highlight">child</span> care which alarms me is the tendency to embark on grandiose building projects without examining facilities available in the community which could be put to dual use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One area which concerns me relates to the latch-key <span class="highlight">child</span>- so-called for want of a better term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These children go to school early and leave late. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to continue to have working families and if we are to encourage working parents to raise families, then governments must make provision for the care of these children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my area at Bellmay an out of school <span class="highlight">child</span> care group has started a pilot project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the most pleasing aspect is that it is a place where children are going because they want to go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is catering for children who wish to go there after school to undertake some creative hobby, thus ensuring that the children who are there because of other circumstances feel that they are not a race apart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this brings about a continuing problem for those children once they leave the day care centre and enter the normal schooling stream. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one reason why I suggest that there is an urgent need to make a continuing provision for such children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is room for a community voluntary service based on outgoing home <span class="highlight">child</span> care problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation highlights the fact that this is only the beginning of the <span class="highlight">child</span> care area in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Despite its imperfections, this Bill which seeks to establish a Children’s Commission is a genuine attempt to overcome one of the major social problems arising from a technologically advanced consumer society which claims a high standard of living, therefore requiring a large percentage of its work force, both male and female, to participate fully in the production of the goods and services required by the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In October 1972 the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Welfare Grants Act was passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Act provided for research grants and for funds to assist local bodies or interested groups to establish and run <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1968-69 the available <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities in Australia catered for approximately 14 000 children only- not a very high figure- and in New South Wales, my own State, in 1972, the most recent figures available, there were some 760 registered <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres coping for 39 913 children up to 5 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The estimated number of 3 and 4-year-old children in New South Wales in 1972 was over 165 000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, only 15.7 per cent of eligible children were attending pre-school in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite these factors married women comprise only 22 per cent of the total work force at present and 70.8 per cent of those are of <span class="highlight">child</span>-bearing age, which I take to be between 15 and 44 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus the majority of women in the <span class="highlight">child</span>-bearing category still remain at home and receive little assistance in bringing up young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the major difficulties which Australia has faced is that for too long the need to build up a pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> care infrastructure, especially at the local government level, was not given the amount of attention which perhaps it should have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every <span class="highlight">child</span> over the age of 2Vi years was guaranteed entry into a pre-school for 6 days of the week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it will take a long time for Australia to reach that standard but it is an objective that is worth considering very seriously especially for those children whose parents wish to or have to enter the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the realities of the situation which have been emphasised, namely, that at present the existing facilities are simply not adequate to meet the existing demand, much less the anticipated demand in future years, I think the legislation is unduly short-sighted in not at this stage encouraging appropriately qualified people to enter the preschool and <span class="highlight">child</span> care area so that there will be adequate facilities to take those children whose parents wish them to be looked after. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed that the Children’s Commission should report directly to the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is of the view, and will certainly carry it into effect when we return to the Treasury bench, that there should be established a Children’s Bureau which will provide a central source of input to a committee of Ministers who will retain responsibility for the administration of programs within their respective portfolios such as those of health, education and social welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Children’s Bureau will not administer programs nor control funding of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the Children’s Bureau will act as a collector of information and a disseminator of trends and information to the Departments of State responsible for various aspects of social welfare matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 19 February 1973-just 79 days after we had been elected- the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  announced the establishment of the Australian Pre-Schools Commission to investigate pre-schooling and <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, on 19 September 1974, the Minister assisting the Prime Minister, the Special Minister of State  (Mr Lionel Bowen),  announced the Government’s wish to establish a children’s commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time, the Government set up the interim commission to look again at the whole issue of <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was to have as one of its broad aims the establishment of the Government’s firm intention that by 1980 all children in Australia would have access to the services designed to take care of their educational, emotional, physical, social and recreational needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the setting up of this committee the Government recognised that no rigid distinction should be made between the education of children and the caring of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Special Minister of State on 19 September stated that one of the real strengths of the Government’s program was that it would break down the false dichotomy between <span class="highlight">child</span> care and preschooling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sad fact is that up till now preschooling originally intended by us as an important aid in removing or modifying inequalities of background, environment, family income and family nationality- had primarily benefited children whose mothers could afford to stay at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only has this situation put children from less privileged environments at an even greater disadvantage but also it has created a harmful distinction between the mother who stays at home and the mother who works. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interim commission was to take charge of the 1972 <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act, passed in October 1972 by the Opposition when it was in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The spending of money must be done in relation to a number of issues- the number and sort of resources already available in the community, the effect upon the <span class="highlight">child</span> and the effect upon the parents and particularly the mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should not be forgotten that it is also a basic resource in <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We pay people an allowance for looking after children- sometimes up to 5 children- in the person’s own home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equipment for the children can be supplied and social workers regularly check on the situation to see how the children are and whether their needs are being met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The more one thinks about it the more one wonders why someone has not yet levelled the charge at us that we are nationalising <span class="highlight">child</span> minding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As speakers in this debate have been asked to shorten their speaking time I shall conclude my remarks by saying that this Bill should go some way towards recognising the aspirations of the community for its children and its future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amongst other things -  lower the admission age to the year in which the <span class="highlight">child</span> turns five. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was also alleged by certain people who criticised him that he was reducing the funds available for other pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> care services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why he was suprised by this criticism is difficult to imagine becuase I am sure that to the casual observer it would have been clear that the State Government was trying to honour a clumsy election promise to lower the age of primary school admission, and to do this it was using Australian Government funds which in every other State were being used for the legitimate purpose of expanding pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> care services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the extent that a large program of construction of pre-primary centres would limit the possibility for the expenditure on other <span class="highlight">child</span> care services, the criticism of the Western Australian Minister for Educaton was quite valid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very simply, the amendments provided for a reconstituted Pre-School Board of Western Australia and empowered it to provide both educational and <span class="highlight">child</span> care faculties for children who were over 2 years of age and who had not yet turned five. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This allowed the Board legitimately to obtain funds from the Children’s Commission for the provision of early childhood services for children under 5, which has been the stated aim of the Special Minister of State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should say that the reason this situation has come about is that even though the Australian Government, through the Interim Committee for a Children’s Commission did fund the preprimary centres last year the Special Minister of State  (Mr Lionel Bowen),  on a recent visit to Western Australia, indicated quite clearly that in future the Children’s Commission would not fund the pre-primary program of the Western Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, if the Australian Government commits itself to funding a preprimary program it will leave itself very little opportunity for expanding <span class="highlight">child</span> care and other services which it intends to provide throughout the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that the people of Western Australia are in great need of all the other sorts of services which it is intended will be provided by the Children’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the second reading speech of the Special Minister of State in which he indicated that some of the other services which would be provided would include full day care, family day care, pre-school education of course, emergency care, occasional care, before and after school and vacation care, play groups and other <span class="highlight">child</span> care activities in accordance with demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They reveal that 365 000 children under the age of 6 years were the children of working mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report went on to state that 437 000 people who were responsible for the care of children between 4 years of age and 1 1 years of age made no arrangements for the care of those children after school hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can he provide a list indicating the number of applications currently pending from people seeking to adopt a <span class="highlight">child</span> in each State and Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-35-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Faced with the need to defend his new-born <span class="highlight">child</span> by opposing wage claims of the metal trades going far beyond indexation, the Minister went to water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I say that I do not defend for one moment, without some comment and reservations, all the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act of 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that legislation is past and is not going to have a great relationship to the future administration of services for children in this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter what fashionable ideas people may have, women are still the only ones able to have children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some years ago <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment- which was free spending money- for 2 children was worth an addition of 7 per cent to average weekly earnings which were coming into a home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For 2 children now it is worth an addition of one per cent to average weekly earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For 4 children in the early 1950s it was worth an additional 15 per cent of average weekly earnings and today it is worth an additional 5 per cent or 6 per cent of average weekly earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, I am concerned that this transfer of significant authority becomes evident in the definitions of ‘services for children’ contained in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the definitions of the services for children, which are the linchpin of this legislation, 7 types of services for children are listed and in many of them the final words are that they are to be available for children who are not being cared for in their own homes, for children whose parents are engaged in employment, for children who whether are sick or physically disabled, or for children where assistance is needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, I believe that all children in Australia need assistance and any public authority caring for them must be interested in them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not enough for a government to say that, with the birth of every <span class="highlight">child</span> a family can be driven into pauperism and then to say that that family, having been driven into pauperism by the government’s taxation policy, will have services made available to it outside the home under conditions that the government determines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to emphasise that it was he, as the then Minister for Labor and National Service, who brought in the Bill on childcare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What was the philosophy that existed in relation to <span class="highlight">child</span> care when the Opposition was in government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The limited philosophy that existed then in relation to <span class="highlight">child</span> care is apparent from reading what the then Minister had to say in his second reading speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Children’s Commission will take its place alongside the Schools Commission, Technical and Further Education Commission, the Australian Universities Commission and the Commission on Advanced Education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I have said does not mean that I subscribe to the view that the Children’s Commission is to be seen as a body concerned solely with education unless one takes the term ‘education’ in its broadest sense of meaning the total development of the personality of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intent of the Government in creating a Children’s Commission is to provide an imaginative and comprehensive range of services so that not just one group of children, not just the children of working mothers, but all children will have access to those services best designed to promote their wellbeing and to improve the quality of their lives and the lives of their parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the features of the mode of approach by the Government is the recognition that in certain areas there is very little interest in <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my electorate of Holt we have been particularly fortunate in the area of <span class="highlight">child</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a commendable approach to the problem of latch-key children and is part and parcel of the full spectrum of <span class="highlight">child</span> care services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand we see councils, committees and organisations of various kinds renting homes for <span class="highlight">child</span> care and other activities while schools and pre-school centres are being used for minimum periods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be that the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre or pre-school centre of today has a different use in a generation’s time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must not ignore the use of homes for family day care where trained personnel could assist mothers of suitable temperament in this situation to look after their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is here that a small amount of money can be expended in order to make that home or church hall suitable for some type of <span class="highlight">child</span> care work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other aspect which I want to stress in the few minutes I have available to me is the diversity of approach which is recommended in the work of the Children’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One could go on to mention holiday care, play groups and, in fact, any other <span class="highlight">child</span> care activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These ensure that the Commission will give priority to providing services for children in circumstances where the greatest need exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means meeting the needs of children suffering disadvantages because of social, economic, health, ethnic, locational, cultural, lingual or other reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means, in effect, encouraging diversity, flexibility and innovation in the provision of services for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With these aims in mind it becomes obvious that the need for a Children’s Commission is real and urgent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, one would concede the need for the closest and most amicable co-operation between the Schools Commission and the Children’s Commission, both of which have an essential but individual role to play in the full development of our children and young people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in my electorate and I would point out that it is not institutionalised at all despite the fact that it is quite a large pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well conducted with the warmth of people who really care for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She has visited recently some 28 States in America studying <span class="highlight">child</span> care and pre-school facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The previous  speaker  mentioned that everybody in the community is in favour of giving proper attention to our children which is, in a sense, like supporting motherhood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everybody in this House supports the view that a great deal needs to be done in providing proper care for children in that there are many children in Australia, particularly where both parents are working or the sole parent is working, who are not getting adequate assistance at the moment and that the community does have a responsibility to provide assistance to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it could also be said that that is about where the consensus on the <span class="highlight">child</span> care issue finishes because there are strong differences of opinion within the community on the whole philosophy of <span class="highlight">child</span> care and this really centres on the role of women either as mothers or as members of the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One view is that as women have rights equal to men as members of the work force, their childbearing role should not be allowed to prevent them from finding work, job advancement or job satisfaction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result of this is the belief that the community should provide and pay for the care of children while their mothers work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could say from looking at the Bill that there is no prescribed philosophy in the charter of the Children’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means that we have not really solved the problems of <span class="highlight">child</span> care by the mere act of providing for a Children’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion the Government cannot leave the whole question of <span class="highlight">child</span> care to a commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The money outlaid on <span class="highlight">child</span> care and the distribution of that money is of tremendous social importance because it represents redistribution of income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Returning to the question of <span class="highlight">child</span> care being paid for by the Government- that is, if the Government pays for the care of children of working parents- that amounts to a redistribution of income away from single income families towards 2-income families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might well be asked: Why should a family with one breadwinner have to pay for the care of children of families who have 2 breadwinners? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That being so, why should such a family be penalised by having to pay through taxation for the care of children of families who are receiving that second pay packet? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am saying is that the Government must ensure that it is aware of the social and economic consequences of all the decisions of the Children’s Commission before financial support is given to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, for example, are paid for by the community what we are doing is taxing everybody to pay for the children of the 2-income family to be looked after. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned that money has been outlaid already for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres but the charges that are being made on the families will recover only some of the recurrent costs of the organisations which are running them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those cases, obviously the <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities should be provided free of charge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chairman’ means the  Chairman  of the Commission; <span class="highlight">child</span>’ means a pre-school aged <span class="highlight">child</span>, a <span class="highlight">child</span> who is attending a primary or secondary school or a <span class="highlight">child</span> who has not attained the age of 18 years and is prevented by reason of a physical or mental disability or handicap from attending a school;  services for children ‘ includes- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wanted to raise generally a problem that I discussed shortly with the Special Minister of State  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  in relation to the operation of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It becomes clear from the terms of this Bill and the definition of services for children that in some respects this Bill and the present <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act will operate in much the same area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned at the more rigid formulas that have been adopted in relation to the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act which may have led to a situation in which those centres which are being funded under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act may not be in a position to receive the same benefits that are now being made available to institutions that will be established and funded by the Children’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to have clarified for the purposes of many organisations funded under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act the extent of any deprivation that the existing and funded institutions and facilities may suffer, and whether they can achieve or receive benefits similar to those that will be made available to those newer organisations which will subsequently be funded under the provisions contained in clause 3 subparagraph (a) dealing with services for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer particularly to a submission which I showed to the Minister and which the Minister received, as did other members, from a number of organisations that established <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The organisations include the St Paul’s Lutheran <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Centre, the Ardill Family Centre, the Church of Christ <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Centre at Mt Druitt, the Greystanes <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Centre and the Telopea Church of Christ <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The submission mentions the salaries subsidy and states that in relation to the experience that these centres have had in the period of operation- a fairly short period of operation, as it is- it is evident that the fees having to be charged by the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres are excessive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems quite unfair that <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Centres which are basically designed and built to meet the needs of people in working class communities should have to charge more than twice the amount being paid by pre-school centres in predominantly middle class areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is because the salary subsidies paid to <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Centres are most inadequate, for example, at Telopea, out of a staff of seven (2 trained teachers, 1 nurse, 3 assistants, 1 cook) employed at the Centre only one trained teacher and the nurse are being subsidised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This seems to me to require some clarification of the way in which those centres under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act 1972 are to be dealt with in relation to the more generous funding that seems to have been established by the Interim Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the Telopea <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Centre it became apparent that certain mother substitute facilities were being provided when there were intellectual and emotional needs of the children when there was a parent in the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The submission mentions the problem of a number of children in a family in which there is only a mother and no father at home, and deals with the problem that that mother has in paying for <span class="highlight">child</span> care in this institution out of the pension and other benefits that she receives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Originally these centres were not meant to meet the needs of a person like this, but because of the large number of mothers who were formerly in the work force and who are now unemployed, it has been found that centres which would otherwise have been full, and were planned on the basis that they would be full, have to take in other children to remain economic and viable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The centre in Telopea is concerned to meet the needs of the surrounding community and those for whom there is this special need rather than take in the children of parents who are able to afford to send the children to that centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is worried that under the old arrangements under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act it will be restricted in this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have drawn to the Minister’s attention a request for funds under the family day care scheme by the same people whom he met when he came out to open the Telopea Church of Christ <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was most generous in his praise of the work which was done by the former Government and of the facilities that were funded under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thank him for the remarks he has made in respect of the Telopea Church of Christ <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has illustrated in a practical way some of the obvious difficulties under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make no criticism of the previous Government for its intention to establish <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres under that Act, but we have to be critical of the standards and of the general concept of finance that is involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The capital cost of the Telopea <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Centre would be well over $80,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is reasonable compared with other submissions which ask for $250,000 for a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The centre accommodates 40 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand from my officers that the amount of subsidy is $16,000 a year, which is a weekly subsidy of $8 per <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the centre now feels that it needs another $30,000 to keep going that will mean another $16 per <span class="highlight">child</span> making a total of $24 per <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The centre is charging the parents $20 per <span class="highlight">child</span>, so the total is $44 per <span class="highlight">child</span> per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> care in Australia cannot be run on that basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are going to achieve an effective <span class="highlight">child</span> care program the parents have to be involved with the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we must do in the establishment of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres is talk to the people involved, get them to have a look at the centres that are working much more efficiently and economically and see how that can be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make no criticism of the efforts of the previous Government when I say that that was the standard set under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that we now have a look at it on a flexible basis to see how we can finance a proper program that assists all children, particularly in the areas envisaged in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I am answering the proposition in this sense: When the honourable member was a member of the former Government he did nothing in relation to <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he suggesting that they are trying to deprive children of a mother’s care? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it to be that in the areas that the honourable member represents I need not finance any of the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres that the State Government has submitted for financing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does not the honourable member realise, as a sensible man, that the construction of all these centres is motivated by the fact that there is parent involvement and that the children are better off by having somebody interested in them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say this to the honourable member for Lilley: He should not engage in the hypocrisy of drawing a line and stating that some children will not receive any attention or assistance simply because a parent is at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would then mean that each year and at other times the Minister would be required to come to the Parliament with State grants legislation which would detail the programs that were to be funded on the recommendation of the Children’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the report of the Priorities Review Staff on early childhood services, one can see the deep involvement of the States in <span class="highlight">child</span> care and pre-school education programs- programs which they directly run and administer and those which they support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that when the Minister replies he will draw attention once again to the remarks that he made in his second reading speech in which he pointed out that the Opposition parties, when in Government, funded schemes for the provision of finance under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act by direct grants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would have taken account of the States’ deep involvement in <span class="highlight">child</span> care and preschool education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if we did in that pilot arrangement, limited in its scope, fund it by direct grants pursuant to section 81, we now believe that because of the experience gained in the administration of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act, whereby the need for a more comprehensive program has been made manifest, in those circumstances the funding should be direct to the States through section 96 grants thereby involving the States and their administrations in the more comprehensive expansion of facilities available in the pre-school care and education area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the honourable member imagine for one moment that we would be satisfied with some of the <span class="highlight">child</span> care programs that have been started in the States? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me remind the honourable member that in New South Wales the amount of money spent on <span class="highlight">child</span> care per head is 26c. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite wrong to raise the legal issue here that the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act perhaps is illegal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the honourable member for Sturt suggest that the Liberal Party will challenge the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member predicted, I would say, his Party’s <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act provided for eligible organisations to be funded directly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position is that if there is a community interested in <span class="highlight">child</span> care, which is prepared to do something about that need, we do not see any reason why funds should be denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let us not be in a situation here in which we must run around hogtied to the State governments which, in the main, have shown no interest at all in <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I fear that there may be a possibility of the catalyst making a recommendation to a commissioner, despite what comes from the advisory boards, and then that commissioner carrying on those views with perhaps personal views to the commission, and funding taking place without any proper consideration of the priorities set by the State or indeed by people involved in <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federation of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Association members who provide 80 per cent of <span class="highlight">child</span> care in Australia at the moment, as I understand it, have not been consulted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I found that my predecessors had not under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act granted any money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were then in a direct relationship with all sorts of <span class="highlight">child</span> organisations that were setting up <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres and they received direct grants from the Federal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement has been made that the training of the personnel to handle these children is in the hands of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They suggest to the Federal Government the setting up of these kinds of courses in <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The commissions of advanced education and other bodies, even universities commissions if we go into the question of research into the needs of children including their health needs, are financed directly from the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the money did come from the application of section 96 in respect of these <span class="highlight">child</span> care associations the State concerned would simply be being used as a post box except where the Minister has enacted Commonwealth financing of the State ‘s own preschool organisations just as we are enacting now Commonwealth financing for or assistance to State owned schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For reasons I have already indicated, New South Wales is the State with the worst record in <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it does not meet its obligation to achieve a standard of <span class="highlight">child</span> care on which it has agreed, of course no further funds will be provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition wishes to see included here an obligation upon the Commission to the greatest extent practicable to consult and co-operate with departments of the State governments, because it is incorrect to presume that the departments of the Commonwealth Government are the only departments that are responsible for aspects of the planning of, the provision of, the training of persons to provide, and the provision of financial assistance for, services for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the Special Minister of State  (Mr Lionel Bowen),  in commenting during the debate on an earlier amendment, said that much of the <span class="highlight">child</span> care program was being carried out in close consultation with the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State governments have a significant role to fulfil in the area of responsibility that is now to be placed on the Children’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Children’s Commission will achieve success in providing an adequate and comprehensive care and preschool education program for the children of Australia only if that Commission is willing to consult with the State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would amaze me if the Minister declined to accept this amendment, which seeks to impose upon the Commission that obligation- an obligation to consult and co-operate with State governments and State government departments which already are working in the field of <span class="highlight">child</span> care and pre-school education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I would like the Minister to tell me whether or not it is intended that there will be representatives or nominees of the State governments, who have this large responsibility already in matters relating to <span class="highlight">child</span> care and pre-school education, on the State advisory boards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said that the Commission will not be made up of people who are experienced in <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Savings held by an ineligible spouse, jointly with another person, or as <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment in a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s account cannot be taken into account either. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On average 2 children can be born in 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recognise that schemes such as the National Employment and Training scheme- the NEAT scheme- grants in aid to <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres and so on are examples of these. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this Bill, although a man knew his wife was having a <span class="highlight">child</span> that was not his, he would be unable to divorce her and he would find under the provisions of this Bill that he would have to adopt as his, as it would be born in his marriage, a <span class="highlight">child</span> who was not his at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not help the <span class="highlight">child</span> and it does not help the relief of bitterness that a woman should be able to say to a man: ‘This <span class="highlight">child</span> will be yours in terms of our marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I spoke in the debate on the second reading of the Bill I mentioned that whilst personally supporting the second reading of the Bill I supported something along the lines that a divorce could be obtained in such cases as, for example, when the partners had been separated for less than a period of one year, where the marriage had not been consummated or where there was a genuine desire on the part of the partners that a <span class="highlight">child</span> be born in wedlock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As most marriages are marriages with children behaviour needs to be considered in determining which person is to be awarded custody of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The correct course would have been to have a commission of inquiry so that people responsible in matrimonial and <span class="highlight">child</span> care matters could prepare the framework of a law for the consideration of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier in the debate I gave the example of a woman who could be in a position where her husband desires to separate from her and, under the cohabitation procedures contained in the Bill, with which I agree, where she could be expecting a <span class="highlight">child</span> in four or five months’ time but the computer says that the marriage is over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This amendment is to omit ‘in circumstances arising out of a marital relationship’ and substitute ‘with respect to the personal protection of a party to the marriage or of a <span class="highlight">child</span> of the marriage, or the property of a party to the marriage, which are in relation to any matrimonial cause then before the court’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Mr Wilson)- After ‘application’, second appearing, insert ‘or where there is a <span class="highlight">child</span> of the marriage who has not attained the age of 1 6 years ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment I propose will require the parties, where there is a <span class="highlight">child</span> of the marriage who has not attained the age of 16 years, to undergo the same reconciliation procedures as are provided for in those cases where the marriage has been in existence for only a short time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I am concerned to see that families are strengthened and that the interests of children are protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no opportunity for representation of the children in determining whether or not the marriage should be dissolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In clause 65 of the Bill opportunity is given for children to be represented only after the marriage has been dissolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 65 provides that, where, in proceedings with respect to the custody, guardianship or maintenance of, or access to, a <span class="highlight">child</span> of a marriage, it appears to the court that the <span class="highlight">child</span> ought to be separately represented, that <span class="highlight">child</span> can be represented, but that is only in circumstances in which it is assumed that the marriage is to be dissolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where the parties have no children the importance of the reestablishment of that communication is not so significant; it is a matter of the bilateral relations between those parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But where there are children it is not a unilateral matter and it is not a bilateral matter; it is a matter of multilateral relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that this Bill as now drafted goes far enough in giving to children those opportunities to have their parents live together if communication can be re-established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not weary honourable members by repeating that speech, but I tried to draw the distinction, as has the honourable member for Sturt, between on the one hand divorces that occur shortly after marriage for a variety of reasons- I am presuming that they are valid reasons- and divorces that occur after the children have left the nest, and on the other hand divorces between 35-year-old people with 6 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member for Sturt has said, really it all boils down to what gives best security to the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am in a bit of a quandary on this matter because, on the one hand, there are many instances in which the insecurity of a <span class="highlight">child</span> is magnified by having an unhappy domestic atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If parents are warring constantly, then children become worried; they ponder what they can do to help and they become emotionally quite upset. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, there are those marriages in which I am quite sure people can persist and should be encouraged to persist until such time as the children are mature enough to have a better understanding of the problems that face an older generation than their own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any relationship specified in sub-section (3) includes a relationship traced through, or to, a person who is or was an adopted <span class="highlight">child</span>, and, for that purpose, the relationship between an adopted <span class="highlight">child</span> and his adoptive parent, or each of his adoptive parents, shall be deemed to be or to have been the natural relationship of <span class="highlight">child</span> and parent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A party to a marriage is liable to maintain the other party, to the extent that the first-mentioned party is reasonably able to do so, if, and only if, that other party is unable to support herself or himself adequately, whether by reason of having the care or control of a <span class="highlight">child</span> of the marriage who has not attained the age of 18 years, or by reason of age or physical or mental incapacity for appropriate gainful employment or for any other adequate reason having regard to any relevant matter referred to in sub-section 75 (2). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Court may, having regard to the matters referred to in section 75 as may be relevant in the circumstances, make such order for the maintenance of a party to a marriage or a <span class="highlight">child</span> of a marriage who has not attained the age of 1 8 years, as it deems proper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Clearly, therefore, it relates to a mother and wife who has the care and control of a <span class="highlight">child</span> who has not attained the age of 18 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to paragraph (c), which provides that the matters to be taken into account by the court include:  whether either parry has the care or control of a <span class="highlight">child</span> of the marriage who nas not attained the age of 1 8 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under clause 72 in Part VIII of the Bill, a liability is imposed on a party to maintain the other party, to provide financial assistance or other kinds of assistance to the extent that the first mentioned party is reasonably able to do so, but if, and only if, the other party is unable to support himself or herself adequately, whether by reason of having the care or control of a <span class="highlight">child</span> of the marriage or for any other purpose whatsoever- this is the wording of the actual clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, in clause 73 of the Bill, the parties to a marriage are liable, according to their respective financial resources, to maintain the children of the marriage who have not attained the age of 1 8 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) In proceedings of the kind referred to in paragraph (e) of the definition of ‘matrimonial cause’ in sub-section 4(1), the court may make such order or grant such injunction as it thinks proper with respect to the matter to which the proceedings relate, including an injunction for the personal protection of a party to the marriage or of a <span class="highlight">child</span> of the marriage or for the protection of the marital relationship or in relation to the property of a party to the marriage or relating to the use or occupancy of the matrimonial home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was for that reason that in paragraph (e) of the interpretation of ‘matrimonial causes’ it had been proposed to make it rather more precise and instead to refer to the personal protection of a party to the marriage or of a <span class="highlight">child</span> of the marriage or the property with respect to the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Accepting the view that injunctive proceedings can protect a person from violence or protect a <span class="highlight">child</span> of the marriage, that seems to me to be sufficient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is somewhat astounding because it would mean that it would place in jeopardy a program we have just announced, in cooperation with the Victorian Government, to assist 54 000 children in Victoria in obtaining <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also worthy of note that the existing <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act introduced by the Opposition when in government was not subject to challenge; it provides for funds to be made direct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would welcome any legal challenge from the Victorian Government because it would mean that there would be no <span class="highlight">child</span> care program in that State, and I think that if the Minister is so game as to put in jeopardy that program which is already under way he will pay the penalty at the polls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The honourable member for Henty  (Mrs <span class="highlight">Child</span>),  who has just resumed her seat, challenged the Opposition to write down certain things and related her remarks in particular to the subject of the means test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What was said by the honourable member with respect to Tasmania was completely destroyed by the remarks of the honourable member for Henty  (Mrs <span class="highlight">Child</span>). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not true to claim that the name of the natural mother of the children appeared on the Medibank cards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had the matter checked and it transpires that, in relation to the first of the 2 children concerned, a claim was made for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment in April 1961. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the second <span class="highlight">child</span>, a claim was made in June 1962. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On both claims the woman described herself as the foster mother of the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the second claim, which was made some 14 months after the first claim, the woman concerned showed again the first <span class="highlight">child</span>’s given names exactly as they appeared on the original application. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At no time were the adopted given names of the children notified to the Department of Social Security for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means that for more than a decade the people concerned in this matter who complained to  Mr Hartwig  have been receiving <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for the children concerned without in any way being distressed to the point of contacting the Department and advising that there had been a change of name. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret any instance of distress caused to the family but, on the other hand, if the family had advised the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment section of the Department of Social Security of the change of name, prompt action could have been taken to change the records. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also remind honourable members that there was a 14 months’ lapse of time between the first and the second claims for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and that on the occasion of the second claim the woman concerned still showed herself as a foster mother and still gave the original or given name of the <span class="highlight">child</span> as it was before adoption when it was changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment records and the electoral roll records are being used for the distribution of Medibank cards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could say that almost every man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> at some stage must have been driving roofing nails into the roofs of houses in Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I I per cent per dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> to a maximum of 3 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, for a widow with three dependent children the payment would be 100 per cent of the member’s pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My first amendment and the consequential amendments propose to retain the present 62 te per cent formula, but to agree with the proposal that the first 3 dependent children should each be paid 1 1 per cent of the pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because there is a residue of 456 per cent, to make a 100 per cent pension we propose that the balance be paid where there is a dependent fourth <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are now in a position where the Opposition says that if there is a fourth dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> it will agree to pay to a widow with 4 dependent children what the Government is proposing to pay to a widow with 3 dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, it has been proposed that the widow’s pension be increased from  62Vi  per cent to 67 per cent of a member’s pension plus 1 1 per cent for each <span class="highlight">child</span> for a maximum of 3 dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an entirely inadequate fiat rate addition for children at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We approve the proposed pension of 11 per cent for each <span class="highlight">child</span> to a maximum of 3 children - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface my question by reminding him that he said in this House this week that adopted children who received Medibank cards in the name given by their natural mother and not their present name did so because of neglect to advise the Department of Social Security of the correct name. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore ask him: Why would a <span class="highlight">child</span> adopted 4 years ago, whose present name was advised to the Department of Social Security 4 years ago, whose endowment has been paid in that name for 4 years- this is verified by checking- and who is recorded by the Department of Social Security in that name, still this week get his Medibank card in the christian names given by his natural mother, causing very considerable distress? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister who has guaranteed confidentiality and secrecy, now tell us where Medibank does get its information, because in this and other cases it did not and could not have got it from Department of Social Security and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment records? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The information is in fact taken from the computer magnetic tapes of the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment section of the Department of Social Security and transcribed on to magnetic tapes for Medibank purposes- for the distribution of these cards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it impossible to understand how any names but the given names registered on the magnetic tape for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment purposes could be transcribed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I repeat, I do not see how it is possible to get anything but the given names of the children concerned which are used in paying <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, because the cheques for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment are printed according to processes which use computer magnetic tapes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each week we pay out I think nearly 4 million- it is certainly well over 3 million- <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment cheques, well over one million pension cheques and other forms of payment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should be aiming at centres where parents can participate in activities of their choice while children are either participating in theirs or, if too young, are being cared for in well-planned, stimulating <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is the seat held by the honourable member for Henty  (Mrs <span class="highlight">Child</span>). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to delay the Committee to any great extent, but the effect of the amendments put forward by the Senate would be to destroy the Children’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would effectively exclude the Australian Government from the whole of the <span class="highlight">child</span> care program which is a social welfare program as well as an educational one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government has a mandate from the people to establish a Children’s Commission to provide effective <span class="highlight">child</span> care services for at least 400 000 children or to make an effort to do that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me remind honourable members that under the amendments, if agreed to, we would not be able to pay any money direct to local communities, local government and benevolent organisations which of course in the past have been able to be funded by the Australian Government under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act passed by the Liberal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another is the Community <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Co-operative of Fitzroy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another is the Greek Opportunity Youth Club, which we funded to the extent of $4,000 for a Christmas holiday camp project for 160 Greek children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a ridiculous situation it is for a government to say that it has a program for <span class="highlight">child</span> care and for the Senate to say: ‘Oh, these amendments are only minor’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This program is the greatest breakthrough ever in the care of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this the way we should want the <span class="highlight">child</span> care programs to be run? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act aU these things could be done directly but now, because we are trying to follow the same principle, we are denied that opportunity on the basis that the Victorian Government does not approve of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will accept the fact that  Senator Guilfoyle  will do whatever the State of Victoria wishes and maybe that is her duty, but she should not put the whole <span class="highlight">child</span> care program in jeopardy, which it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The grants to the Hobart City Council, the Clarence Municipal Council, the City of Glenorchy, the Tasmanian Centre for Training in <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care, the Launceston City Council, Tasmanian play groups- they have all been approved by the Consultative Committees and now will be in jeopardy and cannot be funded directly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is wrong with the Australian Government funding children who need these facilities and people who need these services? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a reasonable proposition, but if the Opposition does not accept it it has rejected the whole principle of <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation that we are now examining is to establish a permanent Children ‘s Commission so that in the years ahead funding of these programs can be ordered under an established piece of legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having put that part of the record straight, let us look at this legislation in the light of the fact that it is to establish a permanent structure under which <span class="highlight">child</span> care and pre-school education programs are to be funded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although one cannot but notice the Minister’s heavy concentration on <span class="highlight">child</span> care programs- almost to the exclusion of any reference to pre-school education as has been pointed out in the debates both in this House and in the Senate- the Opposition sees the care of the pre-school <span class="highlight">child</span> in a comprehensive way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are concerned for the complete well-being of the <span class="highlight">child</span> in the family context, in the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre and in the general care role as well as, importantly, in the area of that <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Opposition would, when coming to government, approach this whole problem of the provision of <span class="highlight">child</span> care and pre-school education in a way significantly different from the way inherent in the Government’s program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition urged that, if the program was to be done in co-operation with the States, their role in the provision of <span class="highlight">child</span> care and preschool education facilities be recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We urged that, by the mechanism of section 96 which ensures that the States would be involved in the process of the funding ofthe programs, a better integration would be achieved between those programs proposed by the Interim Committee and, in the future, by the Children’s Commission itself, than would be the case if the Commonwealth simply funded programs direct and did not involve the States in the way that they would necessarily be involved by the application of grants under section 96 of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore,  Mr Chairman,  I want to make it clear to honourable members that, whilst we will not hold up this legislation, as we wish to see the Government’s program confirmed in legislation, we want to- point out that, on coming to government, we will review the whole method whereby the Australian Government delivers its <span class="highlight">child</span> care and pre-school education program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, to achieve the objective of recommendation 2 of the Privacy Committee that each <span class="highlight">child</span> in a family should have his or her own card, the Bill requires in clause 3 that the Commission issue a card to an eligible person upon the request of the person who, of course, may be a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Professor Henderson’s Interim Report proposal in relation to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment was to abolish taxation deductions for dependent children and to use the money saved to increase weekly <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-75-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The terms of reference offered the Priorities Review Staff the opportunity to develop further the thoughts on programs for pre-schools and <span class="highlight">child</span> care outlined in its interim report ‘Goals and Strategies’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-85-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can he say whether tax relief for low and middle income earners with dependants is a significant move towards goals which Professor Henderson envisages being met by increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>These measures are much more beneficial in that they are selective and help more those who have the greater liabilities, as measured by dependants and necessary outlays of life, than could be the case with <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The defect with <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment is that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment increases have to be made across the board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, a given level of expenditure has to be spread more thinly because it has to reach more people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Report after report by professional people shows that it is absolutely essential to give the <span class="highlight">child</span> an opportunity at school and to give them pre-school education and pre-school care for the assistance of the family and for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Before giving my reasons for supporting the Opposition ‘s stand on this Bill I want to take up a point that was made by the honourable member for Henty  (Mrs <span class="highlight">Child</span>). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The honourable member for Henty  (Mrs <span class="highlight">Child</span>)  has covered most of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>When it deals with a statement of deductions for a spouse or for children, it says this: ‘Maximum deduction for each dependant’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It goes on to state that that deduction is $364 for a spouse, $260 for a first <span class="highlight">child</span> and $208 for a second <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now when they claim $400 for a wife or $200 for a <span class="highlight">child</span> they will receive the full $400 or $200 off their taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he dealt with the $1,350 rebate which is allowed to all taxpayers, it could be imagined from what he said that that was the end of it; that is, that the deduction of $400 for the wife and $200 for each <span class="highlight">child</span> were not entirely outside of the $1,350 rebate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite honourable members of the Liberal Party who have had these geniuses at their conferences to go through these speeches and see whether they have yet discovered that technical education exists, that technical faculties in their own universities exist, and whether the <span class="highlight">child</span> with these sorts of gifts has a right to an education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I respect very much what these people say about scholarship, but not every <span class="highlight">child</span> in education is going in for what one would call the kind of classical scholarship to which they are referring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I have said, outside the amount of $1,350 there is an educational component in the allowance for every <span class="highlight">child</span> except the first. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, from now on with respect to preschools and <span class="highlight">child</span> care help more emphasis will be placed on the additional usage of facilities which are already there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we look at the position in the Karmel Committee report we will see clearly that the increase was necessary to benefit every <span class="highlight">child</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the shortage of time I will not be able to itemise the complete list, but I point out that the Australian Government assists in meeting debt charges and in the fields of State emergency services, universities, colleges of advanced education, technical and further education, schools, pre-schools, <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant educational research, Medibank, public hospitals, running community health services, television control, school dental health, health education, home dialysis, blood transfusion services, health planning agencies, housekeeping services, home care services, senior citizen’s assistance, assistance to deserted wives, employment grants, regional employment development schemes, social planning units, Aboriginal advancement, housing, area improvement, sewerage, local government, regional organisations, leisure and recreation tourism and, in Perth, the underground railway study and matters of that nature, going right through to the natural disaster area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It deserves the derision of every man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> who lives outside the cities, and it has got it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, a taxpayer with a dependent spouse and 2 dependent children and earning $160 a week will be $7 a week better off under the Budget proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he were in government there would be no government funding of poor schools in the western suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne to give the <span class="highlight">child</span> of a poor family a go to get a decent education or to give him free university education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many people believe that this Budget should not have seen expenditure cuts almost across the board, that in fact there should have been more positive discrimination in favour of lower income groups, that huge allocations should have gone to deserted mothers and fathers, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, public housing, <span class="highlight">child</span> care and education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it sense to exempt these single people from tax obligations at a time when the family breadwinner with a spouse and 2 children who is earning $135 a week which will be inflated to $ 1 63 by the end of the year which will result in an additional $490 tax payment- nearly doubling his tax- is being slugged? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Families still struggling to reach even the poverty line, pensioners who depend entirely on the benevolence of the Treasurer to keep pace with rising costs, and working mothers, farming out their children to friends while they wait for professionally staffed <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, will wonder what  Mr Fraser’s  equality holds out for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that in my own area allocations of finance have been made towards the establishment of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As long as the earlier Liberal-Country Party Government was sitting on the Treasury bench the type of education a <span class="highlight">child</span> received depended on geography. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest to the honourable member for Henty  (Mrs <span class="highlight">Child</span>)  that any government, insofar as social welfare benefits are concerned, should sharpen up where the handouts are made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the drawing to a close of the war the main focus of attention in Australia as in other parts of the world centred on the children living in chaos unparalleled in history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was the concern and the aim of our Government that eligible children be brought to this country for adoption by suitable families, this to be effected as promptly and as safely as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Indeed, many were the members of this House who were beset by anxious, often deeply distressed prospective adoptive parents waiting to receive a Vietnamese <span class="highlight">child</span> into their homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The anxiety of these people was only heightened by the intense fear campaign fed through the media with no thought to the leagalities for adopting Vietnamese children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government was concerned not only that children brought to this country should receive a warm receptive response from the proposed adoptive parents, but also that the future of these parents and the children be free from any danger of legal tangles that could arise should the correct procedure not be followed from the outset. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have been told this evening, for example by the honourable member for Henty  (Mrs <span class="highlight">Child</span>),  that the philosophy that my Party espouses, and which was so adequately expressed by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  in an address to the National Press Club on 3 1 July last, is that we stand for a policy of ‘survival of the fittest’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They say that the plan provides great tax benefits to the family man with 3 children or more and that it is an invitation or acts as a direct inducement to parents with 2 children or more to go on and to ‘proliferate with a vengeance’ as they put it, with a third, fourth, fifth or sixth <span class="highlight">child</span> and so on? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of us (Lovejoy) has estimated that, if the 1973-74 expenditure on Aboriginal welfare of $1 1 7.4m had been given directly to Aboriginals (estimated to be 140 000), there would have been about $838.00 for every man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Tonight I want to speak about <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that one of the great initiatives of this Government has been in children’s services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1972-73 when the Australian Labor Party came into office $486,750 was spent on children’s services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason for that is that there are more children in my electorate- particularly in the Mount Druitt area- than there are anywhere else in Australia It has been said that I represent the most fertile area of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We formed an ad hoc committee on <span class="highlight">child</span> care and preschool services  2Vi  years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as I said, there is a need because of the very large number of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a need for children’s services and that need has been met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take the opportunity of thanking the members of that ad hoc <span class="highlight">child</span> care committee who served with me for the magnificent job they have done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that this project will be the pattern of future <span class="highlight">child</span> care projects in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The capital cost per pupil of providing big buildings for <span class="highlight">child</span> care is very high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ranges from $3,000 to $4,000 for each <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a matter of fact my own grandchild is looked after in family day care in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It involves licensing women who are chosen for their suitability for looking after children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it shows the future of <span class="highlight">child</span> care for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one of the most important aspects which should be watched very carefully by all officials and organisations interested in this very important childhood service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once again I compliment the Government on its magnificent record in providing children’s services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, when this Government came to office, less than $500,000 was being spent on children’s services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The National Country Party never asks questions about education, it never asks questions about <span class="highlight">child</span> care and it never asks questions about poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This afternoon, the honourable member for Henty  (Mrs <span class="highlight">Child</span>)  criticised members of this side of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has moved into new areas, such as the pre-school area, with an allocation for a comprehensive <span class="highlight">child</span> care program of $74m this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also say that every <span class="highlight">child</span> whether he is the <span class="highlight">child</span> of a migrant, an unskilled worker, a craftsman, a farmer or a professional person, has the right to an education of quality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Henty  (Mrs <span class="highlight">Child</span>)  and the honourable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr Young)  earlier in the debate today made totally dishonest statements when referring to the National Country Party’s attitude and interest in education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody would ever be satisfied with the quality of education his children are to receive or do receive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The document draws particular attention to the fact that in that short period expenditure in 3 areas, namely schools, pre-schools and <span class="highlight">child</span> care which is one group; technical colleges which comprise a second group; and colleges of advanced education which comprise a third group, the increase has been more than five-fold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the areas of schools, pre-schools, <span class="highlight">child</span> care and the Schools Commission for State schools, we find that in relation to government schools in the States there is an increase of 4 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I look further down the table set out in the document on education attached to the Budget Papers and see that in the area of government schools, pre-schools and <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres in the Territories the proposed expenditure has risen from $72m to $96m by roughly 3316 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was recognised 10 years ago in the United States that children who had had the advantage of a pre-school education were able to come to grips more rapidly and more thoroughly with the formal education process when they got to primary school; that at every subsequent stage of education they were better off than children who had not been able to find places in pre-school centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it was that the American federal government sponsored the head-start program to see that America’s most deprived children, the black children, the poor children-  (Quorum formed). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was saying when I was interrupted by the honourable member for Stirling  (Mr Viner),  who called for the quorum and who appears not to take the subject under discussion seriously, that the United States federal government initiated the head-start program so that poor children, black children and children disadvantaged in other ways would be fully equipped to take advantage of a primary school education when it became available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it rapidly became apparent when the results of the head-start program were analysed that not even this step, not even getting the disadvantaged <span class="highlight">child</span> at the earliest possible stage of his life, was a sufficient response to the disadvantage of which he was a victim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But surely we should recognise the need to carry on these classes after the birth of a <span class="highlight">child</span> and make the subject of them the problems which every parent encounters in raising a small <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to see a close co-operation developed between the Children’s Commission, the Schools Commission, the Department of Education, the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations so that a concerted effort can be made to bring parents advice on the <span class="highlight">child</span> raising process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should draw on that body of experience and research to devise programs which will meet the sort of problems which cripple the later education of so many of our children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When my own children have been ill and have been admitted to a children’s hospital in Sydney, for example, I have preferred them to be in the big wards with the public patients. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of means testing the children were put into small wards in the private section of the hospital where the sisters or nurses could not see them all the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing went wrong, but at odd times when the <span class="highlight">child</span> was really ill one felt the need to employ a special sister to look after the <span class="highlight">child</span> because of the worry that they would not be able to cope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In brief, a tax rebate of $400 will replace the existing deduction of $364 for a spouse, a rebate of $200 will replace the deduction of $260 for a student <span class="highlight">child</span> or for one <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 years of age, and a rebate of $150 will replace the deduction of $208 for other children under 16 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In turning to the proposal to extend the scope of double orphan’s pension I should first say that this pension was introduced by the present Labor Government in September 1973 as a measure of assistance for people caring for children who have permanently lost the companionship, support and comfort normally provided by parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Double orphan’s pension is paid in respect of a <span class="highlight">child</span> both of whose parents, or adoptive parents, are dead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principle also extends to a <span class="highlight">child</span> one of whose parents, or adoptive parents, is dead if the whereabouts of the other is unknown to the claimant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Requests have been received from various quarters proposing that the scope of eligibility be extended to include a <span class="highlight">child</span> whose sole surviving parent is in prison or in a mental hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government feels that the position of these children is not greatly different from that of children whose parents are both dead or where one parent is dead and the whereabouts of the other unknown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly it has been decided to extend payment to a person who is caring for a <span class="highlight">child</span> one of whose parents is dead and the other serving a term of imprisonment for life or for not less than 10 years or who is a mental hospital patient and, in the opinion of the DirectorGeneral, will remain so for an indefinite period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the Labor Government the women doing the course were clearing $83.60 a week, most of which was spent on <span class="highlight">child</span> care and housekeeping costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the present moment, just on one-quarter of the children in the Turkish community in Kensington, North Melbourne, have been sent home because their parents cannot find adequate <span class="highlight">child</span> minding facilities geared to their needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In like fashion we recognised the need or the right of a supporting mother, irrespective of the reason why she is on her own and attempting to support herself and a <span class="highlight">child</span> or children- it is irrelevant- to the same support that was offered by the last Liberal government to first-class widows- or were they Class A widows? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, it would be quite stupid if they ignored the obvious attraction of the Australian people to this sort of policy and did not describe to their local government areas, to their people involved in main street pressures for creches, for <span class="highlight">child</span> care, for what have you, that these sorts of things will now have an ingredient of local government, an ingredient of the people making the decision and producing the pressure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These kindergartens are all running into financial problems, but I am pleased to say that following the establishment of the Children’s Commission and the setting up of the various coordinating committees that work in conjunction with the State authorities, we were able to channel Federal money to these areas, and I am sure that the people in these areas are very grateful for what the Australian Labor Party did in its 3 years in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the great attributes of the Australian Labor Party Government was that it introduced into this nation a very effective early childhood welfare program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A survey conducted by the previous Government showed clearly that at least 400 000 children under the age of five were in urgent need of care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least one quarter of the 1 500 000 children under the age of five were in need of <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous Government then commenced a program with statutory support in the form of the Children’s Commission which that Government established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members who were in the Parliament last year will remember well the opposition which the establishment of the Children’s Commission met from honourable members who are now on the Government side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its establishment meant that there would be new initiatives and programs for the care and welfare of young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous Government was able to show that it should not vacate the field and that it was essential that every Australian government interested in <span class="highlight">child</span> care should invent and assist new programs for <span class="highlight">child</span> care development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is against that background that I point out to honourable members the serious damage which has been done by the announcement- innocent as it may appear to be- by the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Matters  (Senator Guilfoyle)  as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government might try to justify it on the basis that that commitment was to an existing program, but it would have a commitment, I submit, to those who need and who already asked for a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre to which the Government has already indicated they would be entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means that children under the age of five in those areas will not have <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody in Australia can justify the retardation of <span class="highlight">child</span> care programs for children in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One cannot say to the <span class="highlight">child</span> under five: ‘It will be all right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking at the matter of priorities, why should women and young children be expendable? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the cut of $9m for the Children’s Commission ought to be the last to go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very little was made of the cut in <span class="highlight">child</span> care but a lot was made of the advantages to industry by the establishment of an investment allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking at the priorities I ask: Would it not be fairer and far more beneficial not to give as much in this allowance and instead to maintain the <span class="highlight">child</span> care program? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can buy a new machine, a new lathe or a new tractor next year, but you cannot replace the care that young children may miss this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The appropriation for <span class="highlight">child</span> care was a large sum of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It involved some $47m, I think, for the children’s commission, but because we could not get the Bills passed due to obstruction in the Senate we could not establish the commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am prepared to predict that the Government’s review will mean that’ no need will be seen for a children’s commission, that it will be left to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have an initiative role; but we want to be able to complement and supplement the States role and perhaps offer alternative ideas on the basis that <span class="highlight">child</span> care in all the States should be of the maximum advantage to the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Already there are 600 applications for <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities and the best that we can offer now is sixteen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We invited all the existing <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres to extend their services for full <span class="highlight">child</span> care and we promised that we would fund them to the extent of 75 per cent of their costs as from 1 January. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are about 500 existing centres in New South Wales which the Labor Party in office wanted to extend into full <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In my electorate La Perouse has a very great need for <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could go through a whole list which would clearly illustrate that there are going to be massive cutbacks- whatever word you use, it means no progress- in <span class="highlight">child</span> care development programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have advice that there are 50 areas in New South Wales which were going to be able within the Labor Government’s program for the establishment of <span class="highlight">child</span> care or pre-school centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In every electorate there are people interested in the care of children, whether they be in Mittagong, Macksville, Bathurst or Bendigo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly people in need are not going to get this financial aid and as a consequence <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities are not going to be established or extended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a very welcome offer but there will be no money with which to guarantee the cost of running <span class="highlight">child</span> care programs that might be needed in areas in which kindergartens are established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely, irrespective of politics, Government supporters can see that cutbacks of this nature mean permanent serious damage to the <span class="highlight">child</span> care program for which there is a very fundamental need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the Parramatta synagogue is in jeopardy from the point of view of establishing a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask them to have a look at the areas in their own electorates which are the subject of applications for financial assistance, for integrated <span class="highlight">child</span> care services or the establishment of new services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can have our political differences but we should not have them in the field of <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have been put forward by well-meaning people for the benefit of children and you could not get a better priority than that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So it is wrong to try to give the impression to people generally that this Government has dumped the childhood services program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reference to the Bland committee in no way implies lack of commitment by the Government to the childhood services program but rather a desire to see the most appropriate administrative machinery developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To try to put some rationality into this debate let me read from the Press statement of the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She said that the Federal Government was giving top priority to providing <span class="highlight">child</span> care in high needs areas with the remaining finance available for new childhood services programs this financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister said that in examining the 5 centres which it is suggested are in difficulty the Government will certainly be looking at those which are in most need and which are in needy areas where there is a particular requirement for <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Grants for <span class="highlight">child</span> care services for the remainder of this year will be announced and will continue to be announced by the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When talking about the fact that there were insufficient funds to carry out programs that were designed and implemented by the previous Government, I just wonder what sorts of priorities the Government has looked at when it has examined the issue of <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first was the reintroduction of the superphosphate bounty and the second was its attitude to the investment allowance and the $9m axed from the Budget for the Children’s Commission’s <span class="highlight">child</span> care projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further to that, when the previous Administration spelt out the principle of supplying 75 per cent of the recurrent costs in respect of salaries, it was to be applied on the basis of particular criteria to ensure that the day care institutions or kindergartens would be extended to cover the overall area of <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be no Taj Mahals set up as kindergartens to accommodate very few children for a brief period of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The maximum amount of <span class="highlight">child</span> day care ought to be met from the funds that are available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Preschools and groups seeking funds should satisfy the Interim Committee for the Childrens Commission that the needs of the community have been investigated fully. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is nonsense to suggest that there has been any serious or permanent damage caused to the early childhood services program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there has been any damage caused to it and the work of the Interim Committee for the Children’s Commission that damage has been caused by the policies of the previous Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those 2 factors together in themselves have done damage to any <span class="highlight">child</span> care program that any government, State, Commonwealth or local, chose to undertake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Opposition, in support of its argument in this debate, suggested that there had been serious cuts in the <span class="highlight">child</span> care services program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, when a nation is upgrading the services that it provides for its children it needs to do so in a balanced and rational way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Matters  (Senator Guilfoyle)  have given assurances that every program in respect of which a commitment was made, every application in respect of which a commitment was made by the previous government, will be honored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What this Government will do will enable much more to be achieved in the provision of care and education for the pre-school age children of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How many honourable members of this House are associated with or know of genuine hard working community groups in their electorates which are seeking to raise funds to provide a kindergarten, a preschool centre, a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre, a play group or some other form of family day assistance only to find that $500 raised the year before last will purchase this year only the equivalent of $300 worth of goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we look at the matter of <span class="highlight">child</span> care services and pre-school education it is terribly important that as a nation and as a government we should have a philosophy relating to the position of the family in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So much of its legislation put on the family pressures that created a need for <span class="highlight">child</span> care services where families were previously able to provide and wished still to provide those services for their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party’s philosophy was to provide <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres for every <span class="highlight">child</span> when the best care that the great majority of children can receive is care from their own mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the Opposition when in government that destroyed the aspirations of families and those children who need <span class="highlight">child</span> care, by creating a huge pool of unemployed in the country and by fanning the fires of inflation so that the value of the services that a government could provide out of the Budget resources available in real terms did less for the community than those resources should have achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A debate earlier today in this place related to <span class="highlight">child</span> care services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>An amount of $9m has been slashed out of <span class="highlight">child</span> care services for the rest of this financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to such matters as <span class="highlight">child</span> care, which was mentioned here in the House today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> care has been the subject of debate in this House but it also is relevant to the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen $9m cut from the budget for <span class="highlight">child</span> care while the Prime Minister hands out a superphosphate bounty to his cronies, the wealthy graziers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government ought to be going to the community and asking what areas of <span class="highlight">child</span> care should be given priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should  not go to  the wealthy electorates and put paid to the opportunities for people in the underprivileged areas to have proper and adequate <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we of the Opposition have indicated already, the Government should not put up mausoleums and Taj Mahals that will house small numbers of children while the kids in Footscray and Collingwood are running around the streets, waiting for their parents to come home from work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This certainly has often been the case in the field of <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Local governments often have provided <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities which are remote from the actual needs of the communities that they are meant to serve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In implementing the Australian Labor Government’s <span class="highlight">child</span> care program it was our desire to really involve the community and that desire was demonstrated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That report, entitled  Project Care,  established a huge and pressing need for adequate <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather than follow the policy adopted by every conservative Liberal government, both State and Federal, the policy that ‘the Government knows best, ‘ our Government set about meeting those <span class="highlight">child</span> care needs in a new and innovative way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike our opponents we truly are the Party of the people and it was to the people that we turned to come up with the solution that generally met <span class="highlight">child</span> care needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our <span class="highlight">child</span> care program we set out not only to provide <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities but also to encourage people to take part in the making of their own destiny, to grow as they assumed new responsibilities, to regard themselves as decision makers rather than as the objects of the decisions of other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Voluntary organisationswhether they be in the field of <span class="highlight">child</span> care, preschool education, health, the aged, the handicapped or whatever- play a vital role in the delivery of assistance to those in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite a hostile Senate and a media partial to the Liberal-Country Party coalition, the Labor Government after assuming office on 2 December 1972 had a magnificent record of achievement particularly in regard to social welfare, <span class="highlight">child</span> care, education, health, legal aid and direct monetary grants to local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the finest achievements of the Labor Government- incidentally it is an achievement which received very little publicity from the antiLabor media- was the granting of $20 a fortnight to the parents or legal guardians of a retarded <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since the cost of milk substitutes is in the vicinity of $10 to $20 a week for each affected <span class="highlight">child</span>, will the Minister acknowledge that hardship is often caused? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the Government’s action is responsible for a 100 per cent increase in the cost of milk substitutes frequently involving parents in expenditure of $10 per week to sustain desirable protein intake for an affected <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The milk substitute now costs $10 for a weekly supply of 8 tins which, with an additional cost of $20 for special food plus special soap and essential cotton clothing for this <span class="highlight">child</span>, represents, as anybody would acknowledge, an impossible financial burden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I point out to the House that such a trainee under the national employment and training scheme gets her widow’s pension to which she is entitled, plus <span class="highlight">child</span> allowances, plus a rent allowance if applicable, and in addition is permitted to earn $20 a week before any reduction is made in her allowance, not $6 a week as alleged by the honourable member for Gellibrand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This significant reduction in the qualifying period will be of particular assistance to women who interrupt their careers for reasons such as <span class="highlight">child</span> rearing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">child</span> care, for instance, which is a subject of great concern to me, the Government will give reasonable assistance but there has to be initiative from people, from local bodies, and a rationalisation of facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister will recall that in the time of the last Government, Commonwealth funding for migrant children’s language training was relegated to a very low priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What arrangements are being made now for the funding of <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant language education, particularly for South East Asian migrant refugees who recently entered Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been quite a considerable increase in the provision of <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education since the scheme was first introduced in 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At June 1970 246 special teachers were employed, 8800 children were receiving instruction and 200 schools were involved in the program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At December 1975 the number of special teachers had increased to 2197 the number of children in special classes was 92 600 and 1278 schools were involved in the program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a development towards not treating <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education as a special matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Special arrangements are being made to cater not only for children but also for adults. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So at the places where the families are now residing special provision is being made for English speaking classes for adults and the children are being placed in schools close to the hostels where special English language classes are available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So the honourable gentleman will see that special attention is being provided not only to <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education generally but also to the special needs of refugees from Indo-China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How can they tolerate the knowledge that $7m has been sliced from Aboriginal Affairs spending, $34m from health care, $9m from <span class="highlight">child</span> care and $30m from environment, housing and consumer affairs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the people of Australia should be constantly reminded that even after 3 years of Labor Government and the criticisms we have heard about <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare and its implementation, we are still operating under a Liberal Government’s legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If none of the desirable structural changes are made to the relativities established by the Hayden rebate system, indexation would result in the general rebate being raised from $540 to $61 1, that for a spouse being raised from $400 to $453, that for a <span class="highlight">child</span> being raised from $200 to $226, that for rates and taxes being raised from $300 to $340 and that for education expenses being raised from $250 to $289. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The higher $40 benefit is payable to an age, invalid or widow pensioner, including a woman in receipt of supporting mother’s benefit, liable for the funeral costs of a spouse, a <span class="highlight">child</span> or another pensioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we say, if we accept the Department of Foreign Affairs view, is that a maimed <span class="highlight">child</span> is of less concern to Australians if he or she is, by virtue of a gynaecological accident, conceived in Guatemala than is a <span class="highlight">child</span> who is maimed in an earthquake and who was born in Indonesia or Malaysia which, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs, happen to be in our sphere of interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The argument is that couples have deferred the birth of their first <span class="highlight">child</span> for several years, perhaps in response to economic circumstances or to changed attitudes towards women working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What this argument overlooks is the longstanding decline in completed family size in Australia from an average of over 6 children in the 1880s to about three in the 1940s and to below three more recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is saying to the parent: ‘If your <span class="highlight">child</span> would normally leave school at the end of November this year we shall require you to maintain him for a further 6 weeks, whether he can get a job or not, because it is more difficult to get jobs for school leavers at that time of the year than it would be if your <span class="highlight">child</span> left school at an earlier time’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I move on to children’s allowances as a further illustration of the cold neglect that Liberal governments of the past assumed casually and of the cold neglect that this Government is seeking to reintroduce by the way in which it is treating social security benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Children’s allowances- that is allowances for the dependants of pensioners- were not altered from the rate of $1.15 a week for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> in the 10 years to 1960. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of the second <span class="highlight">child</span> and subsequent children, the rate was set at $1 a week at the time of its introduction in 1964 and remained at that level for 7 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not subscribe to the belief of the Government that life will be better, that life will be richer and more meaningful by refusing to improve the living standards of people like pensioners by holding back increases in their pension to a later day or by destroying funeral benefits, or by denying them the children’s allowances, or by making pharmaceutical benefits dearer for the sick, or by denying significant numbers of working mothers in the community <span class="highlight">child</span> care services, or by reducing dramatically if not disastrously for many people, the rates of benefit under the National Employment and Training program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the Government’s attention to the fact that quite a large number of children are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time pensioners and other social security recipients with children receive $7.50 per week for each dependent <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the latest figures available on eligible children, that is as at 30 June 1975, there were 9858 children of age pensioners, 46 269 children of invalid pensioners, 138 867 children of widows, 59 568 children of those on supporting mothers’ benefits, and 56 293 children of those receiving unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So updated allowances will not be paid in respect of a large number of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of pensioners or other social security recipients with only one <span class="highlight">child</span>, the amount of money involved would be relatively little. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is those with a number of dependent children who will experience the greatest difficulty and who will miss out most. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members look at the previous legislation on the last 3 occasions, they will see that the section which is amended- section 28- that sets out the rates of pension, has also gone on to deal with the question of the additional pension benefit for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would, however, I submit, at least be about 50c a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is paid to the guardian of a <span class="highlight">child</span> who loses both parents, but it was not paid for 23 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Declaration on the Rights of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> puts it that ‘The <span class="highlight">child</span>, for the full and harmonious development of his personality, needs love and understanding . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bearing of a <span class="highlight">child</span> is described by Paul Ehrlich, that great gentleman, as a 9-months disease and the <span class="highlight">child</span> itself is presented in many quarters as an evil and a menace to the human race. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do believe that a change in emphasis is needed in this community back to upholding the value and integrity of the mother being available to her husband and children and fulfilling herself, finding her reward, in their stability and gradual growth to maturity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To this can be added the cost of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres demanded at government expense by those who insist on their right to farm out their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If money is spent by government on venereal disease clinics, drug treatment and assessment centres, abortion climes, social workers and <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres for working parents there is less, in simple cash terms, to be spent on the genuinely poor, the deserted wives, husbands and children, the widows and the abandoned old. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally I draw attention to the magnificent statement yesterday by the Liberal Party leader in the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly,  Dr Hughes,  in which he called for an increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the qualifying or vesting period for preservation of rights has been reduced from 20 years to 5 years, so that if a woman wishes after 5 years to leave the Public Service for reasons of <span class="highlight">child</span> rearing, she can do so, return at a later date and have her rights preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a welcome step because the provision in the old scheme, and in fact in many private schemes, that the payment of pension ceased on remarriage is in fact a fetter on remarriage and in cases where there are dependent children it often encourages people not to remarry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that is contrary to the socially desirable ideal of a 2 parent family being a better family in which to bring up children than perhaps a one parent family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any <span class="highlight">child</span> at that school is certainly entitled to get those fatalities but what about the <span class="highlight">child</span> in the other schools? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In calculating the deductions for the ‘deductions tax scheme’ it has been assumed that the taxpayer has claimed for his wife and children as dependants and has also claimed the maximum allowable amounts for the education of children i.e. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>$ 1 50 in respect of each <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of the ‘concessional rebates tax scheme’ it has been assumed that the taxpayer received dependants-rebate and that the only expenses claimed under general concessional rebates provisions are those for the education of the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>$250 in respect of each <span class="highlight">child</span>; for the man with two or four children, however, this total concessional rebate lies below the minimum of $540 given to all taxpayers, so that these men will receive $540 general concessional rebate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only in the case of the men with six children does the rebate exceed the minimum; they will receive 40 per cent of 6 x $250 (or $600) rebate for education expenses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That table clearly shows that in respect of an income of $8,000 with 2 children under the age of 16 years, under the old method of the $400 rebate, the tax would have been $1,329. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present method of giving a tax rebate per <span class="highlight">child</span> is much more beneficial and, as I can now prove by these figures, is equitable to all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am dealing now with people who are establishing <span class="highlight">child</span> care programs in their areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have indicated, the Karmel Committee clearly highlighted the fact that in a large section of the Australian community the needs of the <span class="highlight">child</span> are very great indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It follows that the State governments, in their wisdom or otherwise, never really allocated sufficient funds over the years to meet the needs of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless the needs of the <span class="highlight">child</span> are met in the formative years that <span class="highlight">child</span> is permanently penalised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Admittedly other factors, including the factors of poverty and of delinquent parents are involved, but it was clearly established by the Karmel Committee that the chance of obtaining equality was not there for a <span class="highlight">child</span> who happened to live in a low socio-economic area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will notice that in all of the Commission ‘s reports great emphasis is placed on the need to try- I emphasise the word ‘try’- to give to each <span class="highlight">child</span> what is deemed to be an equal opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at what has happened and what is still the position regarding the great needs of children one sees that an efficient allocation of resources has never been made over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We may have a section in Australia agitating for the spending of more money out of scarce resources on the delinquent <span class="highlight">child</span>, knowing full well that the statistics, the record and the knowledge is that it is too late to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is related to the life and the blood of the people in it and the parents of the children, the teachers and the community generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking briefly about the <span class="highlight">child</span> care program which concerns the pre-school area, there is no hope of running an effective program unless there is community involvement, particularly on the part of the parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But everybody who knows anything about education knows that normal State procedure is for powerful political personalities to put the best and the most expensive high schools in their electorate, irrespective of whether there is the number of children there to justify them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In precisely the same way there was no political demand for, and no political kudos to be obtained, when we put every Aboriginal <span class="highlight">child</span> in secondary education on a scholarship which might range from some $250 to $2,000 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was no demand for that from the Aboriginal community, and in wide sections of the Aboriginal community among the parents there was no understanding of what was happening to their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is almost standard in Australia for a parent to regard education as a weapon of his <span class="highlight">child</span>’s advantage- ‘I am a good parent if I fight for my <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s advantage over that of all other children’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is there that a <span class="highlight">child</span> gets an education which gives him an advantage over everybody else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The nation has not got an interest in the concept of advantage for some children’s education; it has got an interest in the concept that education should be an instrument of every <span class="highlight">child</span>’s dignity and advancement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interesting fact which I found was that the 40 schools classified A out of the 9500 schools in the country could make more noise than the other 9460 schools put together because they had articulate parents who knew exactly what they wanted for their children and could argue for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, none of them lost but not all of them were ve.ry happy to see the chances of other children being brought up to their level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position in the Catholic schools, where they try to reach the poorest <span class="highlight">child</span>, was that they had, of course, a very great burden of education, and they had not made an amendment to the Magnificat to this effect: ‘He has put down the mighty from their seat and exhalted the humble and meek; he has filled the hungry with good things and the rich have got the same amount in flat rate grants across the board’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Students are demanding free subscriptions to unions, student representative councils and even sports unions; they are requiring free <span class="highlight">child</span> minding facilities; and so it goes on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The likely effects of Government measures to encourage or discourage <span class="highlight">child</span>-bearing cannot be anticipated until much more is known about the causes of fertility changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the decline in fertility may be just a consequence of women delaying <span class="highlight">child</span> bearing perhaps because of temporary economic circumstances, such as the difficulties that young couples have now in buying houses, particularly in the major metropolitan areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, we need to take into account also in assessing this factor to what extent remarriage within the <span class="highlight">child</span> bearing age represents <span class="highlight">child</span> bearing by the people in question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If women could be assured of keeping their jobs and of not being relegated, by being married, to staying within the house and if they could be assured of re-entering the workforce once the children were of manageable age, this might affect dramatically attitudes towards procreation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is because the attitude towards <span class="highlight">child</span> bearing and reproduction is of such a different order from our own at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be no more money for education, health services, transport, roads, hospitals, <span class="highlight">child</span> care, universities and colleges or urban and regional development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Subject to the provisions of the Social Services Act a Handicapped <span class="highlight">Child</span>’s Allowance may be payable in respect of a blind <span class="highlight">child</span> under 1 6 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Act the allowance is payable to parents or guardians who supply constant care and attention for a severely handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> in their home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A severely handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> is defined as a person who has not attained the age of 16 years and who has a physical or mental disability and by reason of that disability needs constant care and attention and is likely to need such care and attention permanently or for an extended period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely, once the level of an age pension, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment or even a funeral benefit has been decided upon not much of the total expenditure can be scrutinised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I were to say that the <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education program is going to be slashed by $983,000 before the end of the financial year, I do not think that anyone opposite would be able to prove me wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Other specific Commonwealth Government programs such as Community Health, <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care, Community Arts, Tourism and Recreation, and the Aged and Handicapped Persons programs, for example, are the main source of funds for particular aspects of community welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nor do I think our overcoming the neglect of so many decades by introducing a double orphans benefit or a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> allowance, for instance, has made people softer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It amounted to $30m- a cost borne by deferring pensions, by seeking to destroy the system of funeral benefits, by denying working mothers <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres, by making housing mortgage repayments more expensive - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I assume that it was nothing to do with the <span class="highlight">child</span> care program that this Government is axing so savagely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As it would appear from reports that the Government intends transferring the tax rebates for children to an effective form of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, will the Prime Minister do what he can to see that the advantages of tax indexation will apply to those transferred forms of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the decision that, in the case of custody of children, the Act was valid only to the extent that it applied to proceeding between the parties to a marriage for the custody of the natural or adopted children of both of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that disputes between one party to a marriage and, say, a grandparent of a <span class="highlight">child</span> of the marriage would fall outside the jurisdiction of the Act and would therefore have to be resolved according to relevant State law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Likewise disputes between a husband and wife over a stepchild would be outside the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the areas of maintenance and injunctions, the definition has been confined to proceedings between the parties and, in the case of maintenance of a <span class="highlight">child</span>, to proceedings by or on behalf of a <span class="highlight">child</span> against one or both parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The expression ‘<span class="highlight">child</span> of a marriage’ has been limited to the natural or adopted children of both parties to the marriage, although the existing, wider meaning has been retained for the purposes of section 63, which prevents a divorce becoming absolute unless the court is satisfied as to the welfare of children of the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One amendment will enable an authority or officer of the Commonwealth or a State to take proceedings to obtain a maintenance order on behalf of a party or <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Doubts have been raised as to the extent of these powers, and the amendments spell out the powers under a court order that may be exercised, where necessary, to search places and to use force to take possession of a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Two amendments in the <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare area have been included in the Bill at the request of the former New South Wales Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of these ensures that a <span class="highlight">child</span> who is under the guardianship of a State or Territory Director of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Welfare while awaiting adoption cannot be the subject of a maintenance or custody order except in special circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present the Act confines this exemption to children who are under the care and control of a Minister pursuant to State or Territory <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other amendment would take away the jurisdiction that a court now has under the Act to order the continuance of a custody or access order relating to a <span class="highlight">child</span> after the <span class="highlight">child</span> has been adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The forward estimates for <span class="highlight">child</span> care, the arts, and other programs administered by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet have been reduced by about $ 15m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Consideration is being given to changes in the program designed to ensure greater emphasis on <span class="highlight">child</span> care to children of needy families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At present, assistance towards meeting expenditure upon children ‘s needs is provided in 2 main ways- by <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and by taxation rebates for dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At existing rates, the cost to the Budget of assistance through the taxation system is about 3 times as great as the direct expenditure on <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, which is relatively small and has been seriously eroded by inflation in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such families are unable to take advantage of the taxation rebates for children which are available to the great majority of families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In essence, it involves abolishing the taxation allowances for dependent children, and disbursing the resultant additional revenue in the form of large increases in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The details of the new arrangements will be announced by the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  but in brief the main features are: The present taxation rebates for children will be abolished as from the end of this financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The existing arrangements for payment of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment will be maintained but at substantially increased rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new rates of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, compared with the present rates, are as shown in the following table and I ask for leave to have it incorporated in  Hansard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures show that for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> the present rebate of 50c will be increased to $3.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For 2 children the present rate of $1.50 will be increased to $8.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For 3 children the rate will be increased from $3.50 to $14.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For 4 children the endowment will move from $5.75 to $20.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For 5 children the endowment will increase from $8.25 to $27.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The broad effect of these changes will be to increase the weekly level of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment paid to families by between $3 and $4 per <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the weekly equivalent of the present maximum taxation rebate is $3.85 in respect of most children, the overall position of families able to take full advantage of these rebates at present will not be greatly changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are, however, about 800 000 children in low income families which pay little or no taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These include the children of widow and invalid pensioners, of workers close to the minimum wage or in intermittent employment, of self-employed people unable to earn an adequate income, and of many Aborigines, recently-arrived migrants and other disadvantaged groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> endowment will continue to be paid, as it always has been, usually to the mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The full-year cost of taxation rebates for dependent children and students, had they been indexed in 1976-77, together with the cost of the present <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment scheme, would have amounted to about $ 1,025m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will thus be no net full-year cost to the Budget arising from the new system, other than the cost which would otherwise have been incurred in indexing rebates for dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allowance will, however, be made for increased dependants rebates, and zone allowance, where they are relevant, and the <span class="highlight">child</span> dependant allowances that are to be abolished will not be allowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person will be treated as a ‘dependant’ of a taxpayer if he or she is the taxpayer’s spouse or <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 years of age, and the taxpayer contributes to his or her maintenance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">child</span> of the taxpayer who is aged 16 or more but less than 25 and who is a full-time student will be treated as a dependant if his or her income is not above $ 1 ,073. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other proposals which will broaden the eligibility conditions for payment are (a) children of alien fathers will no longer be disqualified on nationality grounds; and (b) payment will in future be made to a person presently ineligible if a <span class="highlight">child</span> is dependent on the claimant or spouse and the claimant or spouse is a resident of <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most families receive assistance for children under 16 years of age and students by way of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and personal incometax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the benefits that arc available to some taxpayers by way of tax rebates for children do not apply to some 300 000 families whose incomes are insufficient to enable them to take advantage of those tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The redistribution of income described is possible as a result of the parallel Government decision to abolish personal income tax rebates for children and students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For such families they will more than offset any reduction in assistance for children arising from the substitution of increased family allowances for personal income tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The abolition of tax allowances for children and large increases in family allowances were recommended by Professor Henderson in the first main report of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increases in family allowances will take effect at virtually the same time as the pay-as-you-earn schedules of tax instalments are adjusted to take account of the withdrawal of rebates for children and students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The new proposals will increase the annual cost of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment by $785m to $ 1 ,020m a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This additional cost will be offset by the abolition of taxation rebates for children and students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the Government proposes in its first Budget to make pensions paid to all persons below age pension age subject to taxation, why are not the greatly increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments also subject to tax? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as the major point of the honourable gentleman’s question is concerned, that is to say the family allowances and the major increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, if I may say so,  Mr Speaker,  that is one of the most significant measures of social welfare introduced in this country by any government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it will greatly assist families, particularly those in the poorer financial brackets, and as I think I said in the statement, it will directly have a very advantageous impact upon the 300 000 poor families with some 800 000 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Caution with the money supply, personal tax indexation and increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment might well be part of that package, but so too would be the continuation and expansion of the effective expenditure programs begun by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fifthly, Labor welcomes the increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, my sixth point is that we deplore the fact that these improvements to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment have been carried out at the expense of so many. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is also providing an increase- a large increase- in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, which will be paid to the mothers of children in areas in which there is real need and in which the private welfare agencies have said that such payment is so necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn to the third element, namely, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any person who has a regard for children and a love of family will desire to ensure that the mother will have a better opportunity to feed, clothe, entertain and ensure the recreation of her children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we achieve more than that, because under the present provisions, particularly with regard to the indexation of wages and income tax supplementary to an increase in wages and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment increases, we have established the proper basis on which we can now approach the trade union movement in order to ensure that the unions are persuaded to come to the party and agree to an incomes policy and, more particularly, a responsible wages policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the point of implementation of the package, that is, when tax indexation is introduced and we have the Medibank levy and the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and dependent children’s tax rebate manoeuvre, a lot of people will be worse off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and the abolition of the tax rebates for children mean that families will have less cash in their pay envelopes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The positive sides of it in fiscal terms are the change to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, tax indexation- which is one of the most important changes ever introduced in Australia- and, of course, a transfer from the rebate system to a cash transfer system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, the statement on the one hand makes substantial improvements in respect of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and on the other hand it takes away the tax rebate system for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all I want to take the question of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment versus tax indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told that the combined cost of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment plus the tax rebate system is of the order of $ 1,021m of which something like $240m, or about one-quarter, is attributable to the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment bill and something like three-quarters of the total cost is attributable to the tax rebate system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is now proposed that we should introduce a <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment system that will have approximately the same total cost but will distribute the overall benefits somewhat differently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply make the point rather categorically that from now on the difference between married and single taxpayers as far as the tax system is concerned is no longer contained within the tax schedule but is contained within the payments for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I suggest is that not enough credit has been given or attention paid- and I think this is implicit enough in the kind of explanation that was given in the Treasurer’s speech- to what was done recently by the tax rebate system that was supposed to operate, and will operate certainly for the year ended June 1976, but will be terminated with respect to children as from 1 July 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that the logical step would have been not only to remove deductions for children from the tax schedules but also to have removed deductions for wives from the tax schedules and put some kind of cash benefit upon what a wife is supposed to be worth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have another question to ask: Given that the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment costs approximately the same as the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment plus the rebate, what will be the effect on 1 July when the tax deductions no longer apply for children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, the proposal to move tax rebates for children into <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment is desirable, but with qualifications, as I will mention a little later, because the net benefit is much less than the benefit was made to appear when the statement was made to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment proposals- moving the tax rebate for children across to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowmentI believe constitute a very good principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government does not want to index the rebates for children which existed under the tax scheme and accordingly is moving them across to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer now to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a most generous move on behalf of the Government to increase <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to the extent it has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to such things as the cancellation of the rebate for dependants and its replacement with a family allowance or increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments; the disbanding of Medibank and the forced return of people to the private health insurance funds, with a slug to taxpayers to pay for it; and income tax indexation as a trade-off to the Medibank tax or the Medibank levy- call it what you will, because it is one and the same thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why did the Government decide to take away the rebate for dependent children and turn it into a family allowance or an increase in the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will save about $l,025m with the elimination of the rebate for dependants, and the cost of the new <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments is the same amount, $ 1,025m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, of course, the Government is not indexing the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It refused to index the rebates for dependents, and we will not see it index the new <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> endowment payments are paid into the banks, and I think it is true to say that many mothers will leave the money there as a nest egg, call it what you will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At any time in the future that the Government may want to increase <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments it can add to consumer stimulus by doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Government document released, or leaked, a couple of days ago indicates that 57 per cent of taxpayers will be worse off as a result of the 3 changes announced by the Treasurer, that is <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, Medibank and tax indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only that, but the proposals for Medibank, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and others form a policy for the redistribution of wealth which in itself is not an economic policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The change from <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to family allowances, together with the abolition of the tax rebates for dependent children, will bring very great benefits to low income families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the basic change now to be made with the introduction of family allowances at a much higher rate than the previous <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment will prove to be of major assistance to many of these low income farm families about which I have spoken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government introduced <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education programs, community recreation projects and schemes designed to improve the quality of life in the disadvantaged areas of our cities- the areas of high ethnic group concentration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are led to believe that the <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education program is included in the general allocation for the Schools Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, there is no longer any guarantee that the special needs of migrant children will be catered for adequately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn to the area of <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not the first time that I have stressed the vital importance of <span class="highlight">child</span> care for our ethnic communities generally and, in particular, the children in the disadvantaged areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The importance of <span class="highlight">child</span> care will increase even further as the Minister has decided to increase the migrant intake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore vital that adequate <span class="highlight">child</span> care be provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proper <span class="highlight">child</span> care also has the effect of giving the <span class="highlight">child</span> of migrant parents the opportunity to improve English language skills so that the <span class="highlight">child</span> will not be disadvantaged on first going to school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, spending on <span class="highlight">child</span> care has been effectively reduced by 15 per cent if we take into account inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be an increase in demand for <span class="highlight">child</span> care services but a decrease in the funds available to meet this demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, one of the most disturbing aspects of the situation was that there were a quarter of a million dependent children in very poor families, many of them in 2 -parent families with the father in full employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For these people current rates of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment are grossly inadequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We therefore recommend that substantial increases be made in rates of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and that taxation allowances for children be replaced by tax credits which should be added to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to help poorer families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Between May 1972 and May 1976 the standard rate of pension increased by 126 per cent, but by contrast the additional allowance for children of pensioners increased by only 66 per cent and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments, which remained stationary in nominal terms, declined steeply in real value because of the rate of inflation experienced in Australia over the last few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These changes have been to the detriment of poor people with children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have always been unhappy with the previous system of tax rebates combined with small <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not only that the poor did not benefit; the rich, who benefited most from the money they received from the tax concessions for their children, used what to them was a small and marginally insignificant <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payment either to swell their children’s bank accounts or to purchase luxury items for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have always felt that this was an abuse of scarce government resources, particularly when there were many poor families who needed much more in the way of family allowances to provide better food, clothing and other basic or essential items for their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment is not means tested, the impact of the combined measures- that is, the increases in endowment payments and the abolition of tax rebates for children- has a similar effect to that of a means test and quite properly will ensure that resources will be directed away from the relatively well off families and into the hands of the poorer families in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some members of the public in Western Australia have questioned the wisdom of a government providing subsidies to those who wish to have children; some have suggested that it is a penalty against those who do not have children; some have said that it provides a positive incentive to have more children; and the most distasteful criticism of all comes from those who say that it gives encouragement to those irresponsible people who have many children but cannot afford them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To those who suggest that it is wrong for the Government to subsidise those who have children and to penalise those who do not, I simply say that in the aggregate there has not been any significant increase in government resources directed to helping families who have children, whether these resources be measured in the form of direct expenditure via <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments or in the form of a loss to revenue through tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other criticisms I have heard- I repeat them- are that this scheme is an incentive to have more children and that in particular it gives encouragement to certain irresponsible people who have large families but cannot afford them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that even the maximum payment of $7 per <span class="highlight">child</span> for the fifth and subsequent children could not be considered in any way as an incentive in terms of either the actual or the intangible costs of rearing a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the people who make these kinds of criticisms about poor people and large families, I say that it is morally questionable to suggest that the capacity or incentive to have children should be judged solely by pecuniary considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To those who put forward these criticisms, I say that their argument means that to deny these poor people assistance is like shutting the gate after the horse has bolted and the children would suffer the consequences if adequate government assistance were not available to compensate them for their parents’ amorous activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, I ask: Who is entitled to say that certain people can have children and certain people cannot? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely in a country such as Australia anyone who wants to have children is entitled to have them and governments must ensure that their policies are structured in such a way as to permit this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These new measures will help to ensure that this is the case, whereas the previous levels of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment in an indirect way more or less suggested that only the relatively well off could benefit from Government assistance, principally through the tax rebate system, if they had children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely this is what <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment is all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not an incentive for parents to have children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not designed to convey special benefits to the children of wealthy parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is designed simply to ensure that when parents do decide to have children those children, irrespective of their parents’ circumstances, are not denied the essentials necessary to give them the living standards that all children in a country such as Australia could reasonably expect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Commission recommended that a proposal for an increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment was ‘for immediate action’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think anyone disputes the value of the changes in the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and dependants’ allowances area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The money that is to be paid in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to a substantial number of families but not all families will be more than offset by the losses of expendable income in areas in which people have greater reserves and are more likely to spend that income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also should be pointed out that 58 per cent of the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments are currently paid directly into bank accounts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The payment of water and municipal rates and the re-equipment of children going back to school, plus the cost of the Christmas lay-off, all happened to fall within that period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I suggest that the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments in those areas in which the family can possibly afford it- if the family could not it would be spending its total income anyhow- will remain in the bank to meet especially those commitments to rates and the commitments of that nature that will of necessity increase because the Government has not in this package indicated a sufficient level of support to local government to prevent very substantial increases in costs in that area being passed on to the public this year in the form of municipal rate increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In comparing the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments with the tax rebates it was stated that the present rebate is $3.85 a week or $200 a year per <span class="highlight">child</span> and the difference was calculated on that basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, because of the Government’s decision to index taxation and to index deductions- for example, for a dependent wife and some other dependants- it is obvious that the indexed rebate for a <span class="highlight">child</span> next year would have been $226, not $200. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the difference should have been calculated on an extra $26, which would raise the present endowment by 50c a week for each <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, although the tax tables published show that people will be 7c or 14c better off, I do not think that is terribly important; nonetheless, for every <span class="highlight">child</span> in the family people will really be 5c a week worse off than was shown in the published figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the subject of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment the report states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an immediate measure, therefore, the Commission would concentrate help to families through <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and abolish taxation deductions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, if the mother wants to work, this assistance will help her if she wishes to pay for <span class="highlight">child</span> minding or obtain some other assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These measures will help 300 000 low income families and their 800 000 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very pleased to see the increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, of course, this increase is basically to be paid for by the discontinuance of the allowances for children, namely, the actual cash rebate of $200 for each student <span class="highlight">child</span> and $150 for each non-student <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the Government proposes to take money from one area and give it in the form of increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments in another area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proposals covering <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, tax rebates or dependent children, tax indexation and the Medibank levy in isolation, because there are so many other propositions at which one has to look. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has cut the <span class="highlight">child</span> care and preschool program, the area improvement program, the sewerage program - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s proposals for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, the abolition of the tax rebates for dependent children, tax indexation and the Medibank levy, which will mean that about 57 per cent of the people will be worse off, will not be ignored by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Broadly speaking, the Opposition agrees with the provisions of the Bill relating to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is part of the package in which taxation rebates for children have been removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Substituted in their stead has been a significant increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first point I raise is that when tables were published giving comparisons of the whole effect of the package, a comparison was made on the basis of a rebate of $200 for student children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that the rebate for children, had it been retained, would also have been indexed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, it is silly to compare the endowment figure with a notional rebate of $3.85 a week per <span class="highlight">child</span> which the taxpayer now loses- $200 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So people will be 50c per week per <span class="highlight">child</span> worse off than is shown in the published tables. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cite the case of a woman who has been receiving maintenance payments from her husband or former husband which one assumes have been geared on the basis that they pay for the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s upkeep. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the father paid for the upkeep he was able to get a taxation rebate of $200 a year for each one of his children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, the woman who is looking after the <span class="highlight">child</span> will get significantly increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But generally speaking I thing that individual cases ought to be looked at rather than make this matter a mass transfer where the ex-husband in every case loses his benefit and the mother looking after the <span class="highlight">child</span> automatically gains that benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no way for the husband to get part of the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment if the children are with the mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Letters have been published in the newspapers in which fathers claim that there will be a significant unfair transfer of extra <span class="highlight">child</span> maintenance from the husband to the wife who is looking after the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">child</span> care area, at a cost of $50,000 each we could have provided faculties for 25 children at one centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s own Queensland Institute of Medical Research studied the syndrome of protein calory malnutrition in Australian Aboriginal children and published the academic consequences in the school work of the Aboriginal children as well as the health consequences in the form of growth retardation and anaemia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At 2 missions where infant feeding was supervised and nutritional deficiency in pregnant mothers prevented, the children showed normal growth patterns suggesting the  Caucasian  growth patterns also apply to Aboriginal children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These 2 missions left Queensland Government settlements for dead in terms of effectiveness for Aboriginal <span class="highlight">child</span> health though their resources were less than Government settlements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Aboriginal belief in that area the earth spirit enters a woman to fashion the <span class="highlight">child</span> when the woman first feels the quickening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The place where she first feels the quickening is sacred to that <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am now answering 2 points that the honourable member for Prospect raised at the Committee stage yesterday concerning- the Government’s proposals to withdraw income tax rebates for “children and substantially increase <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His second point related to the effect that the abolition of tax rebates for children and their replacement with increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments would have on a man who is paying maintenance to his wife or former wife in respect of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member correctly pointed out, the husband or former husband will lose any income tax rebates that he would previously have been allowed in respect of his contribution towards the maintenance of the children, while his wife or former wife will receive the benefit of the increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also correct that no provision is made for continuing income tax rebates for children in these circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And it is difficult, on taxation principles, to see why a distinction should be made between the provision of maintenance for children in this way and that provided in ordinary family circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before introducing the new system of assistance for the maintenance of children, the Government very carefully examined its social consequences, and came to the view that any disadvantages were greatly outweighed by the advantages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not considered practicable, or appropriate, to provide special treatment in the income tax law for persons in the situation described by the honourable member who considers that there will be a significant unfair transfer of extra <span class="highlight">child</span> maintenance from the father to the mother who is looking after the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The more appropriate course in these circumstances would appear to be for the father to confer with the mother to see whether some reasonable accommodation to the new situation is not practicable and, if there is a court order for the maintenance of the children, to seek variation of the order on an agreed basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If my <span class="highlight">child</span> were seriously ill and had to be admitted to a hospital, I would much prefer my <span class="highlight">child</span> to be in a public ward of the children’s hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would much prefer my <span class="highlight">child</span> to have the treatment and the facilities of the public sector in that hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Caution with the money supply, personal tax indexation, and increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment might well be part of that package - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throw in the Medibank neutralising effect on any benefits from <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and tax indexation, and you find that the leaked Treasury document is probably understating the situation when it says that over half of the work force will be worse off as a result of the Government’s deal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that other revenue producing areas being considered include the imposition of a charge for occasional <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres, the strong possibility of a charge on library services, which in most areas of Australia have traditionally been free, and substantial increases in charges for the use of hitherto free public sporting and recreation facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very young and the very old had become a greater charge on the taxpayers along with the army of professional welfare workers, administrators, researchers and consultants, <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres and staffs and nursing homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Social Security remains the legal guardian of the children concerned in the cases in South Australia and will remain so until such time as they are legally adopted in accordance with State law, marry, leave the country or reach the age of 18 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In practice the power and responsibilities of that guardianship have been delegated to the Director-General, the Department of Community Welfare in South Australia, and to the principal officers of the relevant <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare authorities in other States and Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hence the welfare and status of these children will continue to be protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister, in association with <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare authorities, is concerned to do whatever is possible within her powers to facilitate the adoption of the many children such as these and in fact already has signed some 90 orders which have the effect, by exempting the children from the provisions of the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act, and hence the guardianship of the Minister, of permitting the due legal processes in the States or Territories to determine whether adoption applications may be approved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exhaustive enquiries are made by the <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare authorities and considerable delays can occur before the Courts or, in the case of Queensland, the Director of Children’s Services, who is the approving authority in that State, can consider these applications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Delays can occur because of the sheer volume of work imposed on social workers and other staff in the offices of the State and Territory <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare authorities, or in getting the matter before the court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any enquiries about these matters should be directed to the relevant State of Territory <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The addresses of the principal officers of the <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare authorities in each State and Territory appear at the end of this statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has the responsibility for determining the eligibility of people for residence in Australia, including a <span class="highlight">child</span> whose admission is sought by Australian residents for the purpose of adoption in Australia, or an immigrant <span class="highlight">child</span> being adopted overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">child</span> being admitted into Australia in these circumstances would normally travel on a national passport of the country of which he or she is a citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This normally provides a means by which the authority of that country can control the departure of such a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the above reasons, people interested in sponsoring a <span class="highlight">child</span> from overseas for the purpose of adoption or who are proposing to adopt a <span class="highlight">child</span> overseas, should in the first instance, seek advice from the <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare authorities in their State or Territory of residence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a growing practice of people proceeding overseas with the intention of adopting children in accordance with the laws of the overseas countries concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the adoption is not recognised because of legal or other requirements imposed under State or Territory legislation, these children also become ‘immigrant children’ within the meaning of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for this reason that people contemplating adopting a <span class="highlight">child</span> overseas should seek the advice of the <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare authority of the State or Territory in which they reside before initiating any adoption action overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Additionally, those people who have adopted a <span class="highlight">child</span> overseas should similarly consult the <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare authorities in the State or Territory where they reside, as otherwise problems for that <span class="highlight">child</span> may occur in the future if the adoption is not recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These would include doubt regarding the authorization of medical treatment for the <span class="highlight">child</span> if the guardianship were challenged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, it is important that the interests of the <span class="highlight">child</span> are protected in a disputed inheritance matter, or where the dependency of the <span class="highlight">child</span> is challenged following the death or incapacity of the adoptive parent in the event of a claim for damages or compensation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the guardian of immigrant children, the Federal Minister for Social Security has the same rights, powers, duties, obligations and liabilities as a natural guardian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1952, by agreement with the State and Territory authorities, those powers and functions of guardianship of the Federal Minister for Social Security under the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act, have been delegated to the principal officers of the relevant State and Territory <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare authorities excepting the power of delegation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of adoption, the preparation of a recommendation by a State or Territory <span class="highlight">Child</span> Welfare authority involves a careful examination of the situation which can be a lengthy process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Matters of concern to the Commonwealth include correct identification and confirmation of arrival details, including the granting of residential status, possible international implications and the general well-being of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When this is completed, it is the practice for the Minister for Social Security to sign personally an Order exempting the <span class="highlight">child</span> from the provisions of the Act to enable the adoption applications to be resolved by due legal or administrative process in accordance with the legislation of the State or Territory concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subject to the agreement of State authorities which has now been obtained, new procedures will be introduced which give State and Territory authorities, power as delegates of the Federal Minister for Social Security to exempt a <span class="highlight">child</span> from the provisions of the Act without reference to the Federal Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will enable <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare authorities to take all the necessary action in connection with adoption, marriage or departure from Australia without the necessity of referring the matter to the Federal Minister for Social Security unless there are exceptional circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To ensure that the children’s welfare is safeguarded, the Minister for Social Security has requested that <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare authorities continue to refer for attention, matters of an unusual nature or where malpractices occur, and has asked to be kept informed on a regular basis of the number of children in their State or Territory who are known to come within the provisions of that Act or are exempted therefrom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The addresses of the relevant <span class="highlight">Child</span> Welfare Authorities to whom all enquiries regarding adoption should be addressed, are as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This phobia about Russian ships is presumably the justification for defence expenditure of $ 12,000m over the next 5 years- for a 5.5 per cent per annum increase in real terms in the defence budget at the expense of funds for health, cities, roads, the environment, <span class="highlight">child</span> care, education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that it is more appropriate for an Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care to be established under the Minister for Social Security, as part of the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The philosophy of the Government in relation to <span class="highlight">child</span> care will be to see that the funds which the Commonwealth makes available provide facilities for <span class="highlight">child</span> care for those who need it, especially for single parent families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>About 75 to 80 per cent of the funds that the Commonwealth presently spends in this area through the Interim Committee for the Children ‘s Commission pays salaries for pre-school teacher training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Act tends not to meet the major objective, as we believe it should be, which is to establish opportunities for <span class="highlight">child</span> care in areas of need and areas of particular hardship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also have great pleasure in indicating, if the House is interested, that  Mrs Marie  Coleman, the  Chairman  of the Social Welfare Commissionwhich the previous Administration indicated that it wished to abolish- will be the first Director of the Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Authority is really a <span class="highlight">child</span> of that original committee, although not created until May 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Federal Government ensure that the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory legislate to ban the sale and fitting of unapproved <span class="highlight">child</span> restraints. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Advisory Committee on Safety in Vehicle Design undertake research with a view to designing vehicles, particularly family type vehicles, to enable the fitting of approved <span class="highlight">child</span> restraints. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view the most important section of the report with regard to the potential for saving lives is found in recommendations numbers 32 to 41, which deal with seat belts and <span class="highlight">child</span> restraints. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of its deep concern for the number of children being killed the Committee made very strong recommendations on <span class="highlight">child</span> restraints. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appeal to Australian parents not to be irresponsible in failing to have their children restrained when travelling in motor cars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I am driving along and see two or three young children in another car being allowed to climb all over the place I feel like stopping that car and really giving the parents a talking to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children who are not restrained in cars are like guided missiles if a vehicle suddenly has to brake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could well add to those factors the importance to those placed in stringent economic conditions of the family allowances which increase <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment measures of the past so markedly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Custody proceedings have to be taken by parties to the proceedings and relate to a <span class="highlight">child</span> of the marriage or to an adopted <span class="highlight">child</span> of those spouses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe stricter guidelines should be inserted in maintenance Acts as to the matters to be taken into consideration in assessing a reasonable and adequate payment on the same lines as those set out in the Family Law Act which, amongst other things, not only takes into consideration the age and the state of health of each of the parties but is bound to have due regard to the income, the property and the financial resources of either parties, the care or control of a <span class="highlight">child</span>, the financial needs and obligations of each of the parties, the responsibilities of either party to support any other person and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The men said that they would film the students setting up the tent and then film them demonstrating against the fact that aboriginal people received an unfair advantage to education for their children in that they receive a special allowance of $ 1 a day or a week for each <span class="highlight">child</span>- (they were not sure at all). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Owing to the concern of many people, will he give an assurance that he will maintain the Labor Government’s policy of providing 75 per cent of recurrent costs for <span class="highlight">child</span> care and family day care? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While there is a continuation of these programs and commitments in the forthcoming year, what we would want to do is to see that a greater part of Commonwealth funds goes to providing genuine <span class="highlight">child</span> care for those in need- for single parent families who wish to be independent; who want to work and cannot work because they cannot get adequate <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Matters has provided the following information for answer to the honourable member’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-54-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 23 June  His Excellency  agreed to a change in the administrative arrangements order which placed the responsibility for <span class="highlight">child</span> care matters under the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760817_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Almost everyone will be worse off as a result of the Medibank levy and the so-called innovations in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By and large, the innovations in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment reach relatively few people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So he simply deferred the case and the couple were married within a fortnight of the girl ‘s having the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With all the legal humble-bumble that the young couple had to go through, if the girl had not been strong mentally one could imagine her committing suicide rather than having a <span class="highlight">child</span> out of wedlock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Despite the promiscuity which goes on today in the community, a lot of women suffer great embarrassment at bearing an illegitimate <span class="highlight">child</span>, and that could have been brought about by the legal humble-bumble the young couple had to go through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In circumstances where the children of the family are cared for at home and are not forcing governments to provide <span class="highlight">child</span> care faculties by way of creches and pre-schools, a differential payment might be considered to take care of the different circumstances applying in family care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When speaking during the adjournment debate last night he referred to the effect of the exchange of tax rebates in respect of children for the new higher family allowances and he gave some peculiar figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He admitted that families were 80c worse off with one <span class="highlight">child</span>, then he said that they would be 30c better off with 2 children, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tax rebate for children last year was $200 for each <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This year with indexation it was proposed that it would be $226 for each <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government had not introduced its new <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment scheme and abolished the tax rebate, a family with one <span class="highlight">child</span> could have claimed $4.35 a week as a tax rebate plus 50c for the first <span class="highlight">child</span>, making a total of $4.85 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now a family with one <span class="highlight">child</span> will receive <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment at the rate of $3.50 a week, a loss of $1.35 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the honourable member for Eden-Monaro should be able to follow the figures for one <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the previous arrangement, the calculation for a family with 2 children was twice the $4.35 a week tax rebate, which equals $8.70, plus one lot of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment at 50c a week and another at $1 a week, totalling $10.20 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, under the new system, the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment rate is $3.50 for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> and $5 for the second <span class="highlight">child</span>, totalling $8.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This represents a loss, under the new system, of $1.70 a week for a family with 2 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the previous system a family with 3 children would have received 3 times the $4.35 a week tax rebate, which equals $13.05, plus the total <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment to which they would have been entitled of $3.50 a week, making a total amount of $16.55. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the new system a family with 3 children will receive $14.50 a week, a loss of $2.05c. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hopefully the honourable member for Eden-Monaro could make the appropriate calculations for families with 4, 5 and 6 children but I shall give him the figures for a family with 4 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the previous system 4 times the $4.35 a week tax rebate would equal $17.40, which with the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment entitlement added would amount to $23.15 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment rate for such a family is $20.50 a week, which represents a loss of $2.65 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main features of the system are these: The former <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments will be replaced by a new system of family allowances under which the family with one <span class="highlight">child</span> will receive $3.50 a week from the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The family with 2 children will receive $8.50 which was formerly $1.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The family with 4 children will receive $20.50 a week and the family with 5 children will receive $27.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An additional $7 a week is paid for each additional <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the other key aspect of the system is that at the same time the tax rebates for children have been abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another is the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One other area that will be cut- here again, it has been quite evident in my electorate- is children’s services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, reduced take-home paythe impact of the Government’s fiscal measures relating to the introduction of personal tax indexation, the increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> allowances, the abolition of tax deductions for children and the imposition of the Medibank levy- will have the combined effect of disadvantaging many families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was under some strange misapprehension that for every <span class="highlight">child</span> of a family there was a $200 rebate; he said that in his speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I simply reiterate that in my case, with 5 children, I lost $800 in tax rebates, which is $15.40 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the honourable member for Prospect cares to add up the figures he will find that in my case with 5 children- city members probably do not quite realise that there are still a lot of fertile people in the country- we will gain $3.85 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He realises something that few members of the Liberal Party of Australia realise- he will have to say it to them 50 times before they understand it, although it is a relatively simple proposition- that is, that the family allowance was created at the expense of the <span class="highlight">child</span> rebate allowance solely to avoid indexing that <span class="highlight">child</span> rebate allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The most significant redistribution in terms of personal benefits took place when the previous Government introduced the new tax system and initiated a system of <span class="highlight">child</span> rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It meant that wealthy people like the honourable member for St George  (Mr Neil),  who made money by failing to keep people out of gaol- as an advocate in the courts- were receiving about 60c to 66c in each dollar for each <span class="highlight">child</span> for whom they claimed, if they claimed for all the children for whom they should have claimed, whereas the average income earner was receiving only about 35c to 40c in the dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the Government has done is to take that system, move it sideways and give it a little bit of padding as sugar coating to get it over this year to avoid- this is the sole motivation behind what the Government did- the cost that would have flowed as a result of the indexing of these <span class="highlight">child</span> rebates if they had been left in the tax system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not content with a sojourn into the game of ‘Guess The Deficit’, the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  came into the fray with his election assertion that every man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> owed the Government $500 because of the deficit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the abolition of dependant tax rebates, the increases in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment have to be paid for by a real increase in taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However the phoneyness of the Government’s claim of keeping the Budget outlays the same as they were last year is exposed by the fact that included in the 1 1.3 per cent increase in outlays is <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment or the family allowance payments which were a consequence of the abolition of a tax deduction which amounted to $700m in a full year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leaveRecent publicity has been given to situations where residents of Australia have proceeded overseas to arrange adoptions of young persons without obtaining the necessary support of Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to inform the House of the Government’s attitude to the entry of children in such circumstances, thereby providing guidance on the Government’s policy to potential adoptive parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This should help to avoid the disappointment that Australian residents seeking to adopt children overseas may experience if authority for entry of the children to Australia is withheld because of non-compliance with Australian requirements for adoptions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>to meet the circumstances of Australian citizens who desire to adopt a <span class="highlight">child</span> from an overseas country; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to ensure as far as practicable that the adoption will be successful and that the <span class="highlight">child</span> will settle harmoniously into its new community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite often an Australian resident has adopted a <span class="highlight">child</span> in an overseas country and sought entry of the <span class="highlight">child</span> to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This sort of situation was considered in May 1976 by a conference of Australian State and Territory social welfare administrators which recommended that immigration policy should be reviewed for children subject to foreign adoption orders to allow entry only of those who have been subject to orders likely to be recognised by an Australian Court; who have been subject to orders considered unlikely to be recognised in Australia but where the adopting parents have been approved as suitable to adopt by the adoption authorities in their State or Territory of normal residence; or who have had a <span class="highlight">child</span>-parent relationship of long standing and where refusal of entry of the <span class="highlight">child</span> would not promote his or her welfare and best interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Minister for Immigration and Ethic Affairs, my role is primarily to determine applications for entry to Australia of children for adoption on the basis of the principles and recommendations I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with those principles and subject to sound health the entry to Australia of an overseas <span class="highlight">child</span> is normally approved where the adoption proposal has the support of the <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare authorities in the State or Territory of residence of the proposed adoptive parents, and the authorities in the overseas country in which the <span class="highlight">child</span> is living are agreeable to the adoption being arranged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all adoption procedures the welfare of the <span class="highlight">child</span> is of paramount importance and so far as inter-country adoptions are concerned the Australian Government will be guided by the views of the State or Territory <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Observance of this arrangement will ensure that the best interests of children involved in “ inter-country adoption will be served and that their legal rights will be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has extended to the mothers of Australia the most generous family allowances in history, namely, $3.50 for the first <span class="highlight">child</span>, $5 for the second <span class="highlight">child</span>, $6 for the third and fourth children and $7 for the fifth and subsequent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those pre-school teachers and <span class="highlight">child</span> care educators present at the meeting objected strongly to this point of view and argued that only a trained professional has the capacity to enrich the experiences of young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I direct a question to the Minister for Health who represents the Minister for Social Security in this place and I refer to an open letter written by his ministerial colleague which indicated that the 75 per cent subsidy for pre-school <span class="highlight">child</span> care would obviously be reduced next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister give an assurance that the average wage earner and the single parent will not have to pay any more for <span class="highlight">child</span> care, bearing in mind that they have lost the dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> allowance and now have to pay for Medibank? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister given an assurance that single parents and those people earning less than average weekly earnings will not have to pay more for <span class="highlight">child</span> care because they have lost the dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> allowance and will also have to pay the Medibank levy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will regard the question as being on notice, particularly that part in relation to the <span class="highlight">child</span> care aspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that the Minister for Social Security is currently having discussions with her State counterparts in respect to the <span class="highlight">child</span> care program, which also includes pre-schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The increase in payments to handicapped children from $10 to $ 1 5 is also most welcome, but I am sure that the Treasurer is aware of the great needs which still remain for educating the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> into the tertiary area of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that next year’s Budget will see the extension of appropriate educational allowances and the extension of invalid pensions to disabled children over the age of 16 years who remain full-time students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I put it to honourable members that they have the same anachronism that the payroll tax had when it was introduced to pay <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, for pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> care services in 1973-74, the recurrent expenditure totalled only $4,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He seems to take the attitude that whereas Australian people generally accept the proposition that many things that are important to individuals and to the nation at large should be financed on a capacity to pay principle- I am referring to such matters as social welfare benefits, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, widow pensions, age pensions, even the defence of the country and many others that come under the administration of State governmentswhen it comes to health we ought to depart from that principle and revert to a philosophy whereby people have to look after themselves and whereby a levy ought to be paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can honourable members opposite think of a more simple proposition than paying from the proceeds of taxation so that the rich pay more than the poor as is the case in respect of widows’ pensions, <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, defence, education and all these other services for which we legislate from time to time? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the Bill clarifies certain provisions of the principal Act- the Family Law Act- relating to maintenance and custody where the <span class="highlight">child</span> or children concerned are in the care of State welfare authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, these courts have a <span class="highlight">child</span> minding room where parents can leave their children while they are being counselled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to have family law administered by one court, if matters such as arose from the case  Farrelly  v.  Farrelly  are to be dealt with, if matters such as property, apart from divorce, the custody of illegitimate children, applications for custody by in-laws of children of a marriage and applications for custody in relation to children who are only  de facto  children of a particular marriage- for instance, the <span class="highlight">child</span> of one of the parties- are to be dealt with by the court the only way of doing it at the moment is by having State Family Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Admittedly, legal aid has been the poor <span class="highlight">child</span> of all State and Australian governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Local government must rid itself of the Cinderella syndrome or the <span class="highlight">child</span> of the States syndrome that it has attached to itself in past decades. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear, if one studies the Borrie report, that a great majority of mothers of young children are at home caring for their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be argued by some who would like to see substitute care provided for every <span class="highlight">child</span> that the reason those mothers are at home is that they do not have <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres where they can place their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there is another interprettation of the facts; that is, that those mothers prefer to be at home with their children and need support services to enable them to continue to be the primary care givers for those children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is possible when the children of a family are at school for the mother to work and she chooses to do so- and over 50 per cent of mothers in the community make that choice- then in those circumstances the family has 2 incomes, but families with young children are very often dependent on only one income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an urgent need for careful examination of family incomes to ensure that families with young pre-school children have sufficient income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, such families need the support of a whole range of childhood services that are not based upon the idea of <span class="highlight">child</span> care, which in the minds of so many people conjures up the idea of substitute care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said in my opening remarks, I urge upon all those who believe that the mother should be the primary care given for young children to say so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is developing in their areas a <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre, they should go along to ensure that it develops upon the basis for which it is being established- to support the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a Press Release in the Sydney Morning Herald on 26 July 1976, it stated that the Federal Government will cut funds for Pre-Schools and it is likely the money will go to increase aid for more needy children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mrs Marie  Coleman, Director for the Federal Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care, said that underprivileged children were receiving little help and she felt they were the group most in need of Government assistance, but we feel that we are well and truly rilling an essential community need with our Centre and Centres such as ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The approximate situation is that money outlays are expected to increase by 7.8 per cent, excluding the family allowances, which are, of course, completely offset by the increased tax receipts from the abolishing of <span class="highlight">child</span> rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is essential that the lone father be given a pension in order that he has a greater option to work or not to work so that he can get by with part time work which will allow him to spend more time at home with his children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What happens to a 4-year old <span class="highlight">child</span> who experiences this kind of constant change of significant persons in his or her life? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Lone fathers in Australia require more <span class="highlight">child</span> minding facilities, with such faculties having more flexible hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More domiciliary assistance is required because fathers are not equipped for a sudden role transition- the buying of clothes for children, cooking, house cleaning, clothes mending, and weekly shopping for the house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are all tasks foreign to him, quite apart from the emotional problem a lone father has in being required to relate to his children in a way which he has never done before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can imagine the pressures that this boy’s father faces when he has to go to work and leave his <span class="highlight">child</span> in the care of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lone fathers are often very poor and cannot afford their own transport They need mobility to take their children to <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centres and to places that children normally want to visit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the Government investigate the possibility of providing additional tax concessions for people in these circumstances, not only for housekeeping fees and <span class="highlight">child</span> minding fees but also for motor vehicle insurance and registration fees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is always enormous pressure on them, and the saddest aspect of all is that children raised in these circumstances must suffer irreparable emotional and psychological harm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is no question that improved income support, improved domiciliary care, improved <span class="highlight">child</span> minding facilities and a more equitable disbursement of welfare funds between lone fathers and lone mothers would go a long way towards relieving some of the pressures on these families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly we should take into consideration the abolition of deductibility for taxation purposes of dependent children, which paid for the increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the plus side there is tax indexation, as the Minister mentioned, and an increase in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were told that children as young as 8 years of age are being intoxicated; that wives are being beaten up to make them hand over <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, and that <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment increases- the baby money- has been and is being used to buy grog; that charter planes are flying loads of liquor into reserves; that one community passed around a hat on one occasion and that $3,000 was collected in 2 days to buy grog; that husbands are selling women to finance liquor supplies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill provides for the rate of this benefit in respect of each physically or mentally handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 years of age to be increased from $3.50 a day to $5 a day with effect from 1 November 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the House is aware, the Government has also decided to increase the handicapped children’s allowance from $10 a week to $ 1 5 a week, which is payable under the Social Services Act 1947-1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This progressive change, when considered in conjunction with the increases in pension rates to take effect from 11 November 1976 will mean that a single age or invalid pensioner without a <span class="highlight">child</span> will, regardless of his assets, retain some pension eligibility until his income, apart from pension, reaches $ 107 a week or $5,564 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance is to be increased from $10 to $15 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s allowance is particularly designed to help the parents or guardians of severely handicapped children under the age of 16 years who need constant care and attention and who provide this care in the family home rather than place the <span class="highlight">child</span> in an institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This allowance is currently being paid to the parents or guardians of over 19 000 severely handicapped children who care for the children at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One aspect covered by the new guidelines is the position of infant children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Up to now the view has been taken that in some instances a severely handicapped infant required no greater degree of constant care and attention than a conventional infant and therefore it was not possible to grant handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new guidelines will provide that where an infant <span class="highlight">child</span> is diagnosed as having a physical or mental disability, by reason of which he is likely to qualify as a severely handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> within the terms of the legislation, eligibility will be conceded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increase in the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s allowance from $ 1 0 a week to $ 1 5 a week is estimated to cost $3.4m in 1976-77 and $5.2m in a full year, bringing total expenditure to $14.1m in 1976-77 and $15.9m in a full year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, such matters as education and <span class="highlight">child</span> care have also been greatly affected and this has affected the children and the communities in those centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#debate-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1975-76 $10m was spent on <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education under the Immigration (Education) Act 1971 in the six months period to 31 December 1975; from January 1976, however, the <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education program has been financed from general recurrent grants administered by the Schools Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#debate-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is becoming increasingly apparent that primary schools in their preoccupation with the more esoteric side of a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s development are failing in their job to teach reading, writing and numeracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#debate-13">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no quarrel with the increased educational emphasis on helping the <span class="highlight">child</span> to develop to fulfil his or her full potential as a young human being, but a modern member of society has little future if he cannot read, write and count. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#debate-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most Australians see that the school ‘s role is to equip their children with the basic skills needed to get jobs and to live in society as it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#debate-13">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the idea behind the bilingual program is that the <span class="highlight">child</span> who has learnt to speak another tongue- in the case of Australia, a tongue other than English- needs to be taught initially how to read and write in that language before making the jump into the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#debate-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a tragedy because there are greater demands on the <span class="highlight">child</span> skills today than there were in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#debate-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, in the field of migrant education it is noticeable that the <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education scheme has been absorbed into the School’s Commission program and that this effectively reduces the suggested real growth in the schools’ program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But quite obviously <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres do not have as great an attraction for people who live in country areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the present time in my State of Queensland the State Government does not provide transport for children who wish to attend pre-schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The same sort of thing is done by the Opposition in respect of <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But these special services will exist to support and assist classroom teachers, not to relieve them of the responsibility of the <span class="highlight">child</span> with problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us look again at the dependants’ allowance for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fact is that children have never counted for much in monetary terms under Liberal -National Country Party conservative governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allowance for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> stayed at $1.15 from 1951 to 1960 inclusive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Previously we introduced a tax rebate which was worth $3.85 a week for each <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would mean with <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> a total payment of $4.85 as against a payment under the new arrangements of $3.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore a family with one <span class="highlight">child</span> will be $1.35 a week worse off as a result of the new family allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again in the case of a family with 2 children the indexed tax rebate with <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment would have been $10.20 against a family allowance of $8.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures continue in that way as a result of indexing the tax rebate and relating it to <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be no adjustment to supplementary assistance and allowances, benefits for children or, most importantly, what is now called the family allowance, or <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The indexed amount of rebate would have been $4.35 in the case of the first <span class="highlight">child</span> plus 50 cents for <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The family would have received $4.85 net benefit during each week for the first <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A family with 2 children would have received $8.70 as tax rebate plus $1.50 as <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for the 2 children, a total amount of $10.20. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But they will receive $8.50 as a family allowance for 2 children, a loss of $1.70. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The family with 3 children would have received $13.05 as a tax rebate plus $3.50 as <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, a total of $ 16.55 compared with the new family allowances of $14.50, a net loss of $2.05. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For 4 children, there is a loss of $2.65 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to that, the important point that people must realise is that there will be no indexation of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment or family allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I raised this point before, Government supporters said that the Government at no stage claimed that it would index tax rebates for dependent children which were increased from $200 to $226. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members opposite look at the Budget Papers, they will see quite clearly that the $200 <span class="highlight">child</span> rebate was increased to $226. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the honourable member that it is the duty of parents to look after their children once they leave school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that it would have been the wish of every parent- it surely is in my own case- to look after his children immediately they leave school, and indeed, for as long as is necessary until such time as they find their feet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Who would suggest that any parent should discard a <span class="highlight">child</span> immediately that <span class="highlight">child</span> has finished his or her education? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are an increase in the standard and married rates of pension, adjustment of the standard and married rates of pension and benefits periodically; the introduction of an income test for pensions, replacing the previous merged means test; an increase in the rate of the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance; and a new arrangement to pay unemployment and sickness benefit on a fortnightly rather than weekly basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The allowance paid to dependent children is to remain at $7.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that this House will agree that there must be no argument that the most significant change in the social security benefits area has been the amalgamation of <span class="highlight">child</span> and student endowment into a single family allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It gives effect to the Government’s decision to increase the rate of handicapped children’s benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The handicapped children’s benefit is payable to an eligible voluntary, religious or charitable organisation, or local governing body, which provides approved residential accommodation for handicapped children who are engaged in training programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also provides for the rate of this benefit in respect of each physically or mentally handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 years of age to be increased from $3.50 to $5 a day with effect from 1 November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Currently this benefit is being paid to 86 homes in respect of 1400 handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also give the Minister and the Government credit for having increased the allowance from $3.50 a day to $5 a day in respect of each handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> in approved residential accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suppose there is no other benefit which is more ignored by the Government members than the additional pension benefit for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It benefits nearly 300 000 children and some 150 000 pensioners who qualify for the additional pension benefit for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That will mean that whereas during the period of the last 2 Parliaments we saw that amount move in 3 years from $4 a <span class="highlight">child</span> to $7.50 a <span class="highlight">child</span>- nearly double- we will see the amount remain static during the time of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I seek leave to have incorporated in  Hansard  a table which takes into account the tax rebate system which we introduced and which represented a significant redistribution of resources to families, indexed with the personal tax indexation figure of 13 per cent plus the cumulative <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for different size families, and which shows that under the new arrangement families are worse off financially than they would have been if the old system had been retained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I rise today to discuss the matter of the Fairbridge scheme for migrant children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Kingsley  Fairbridge was a South African born scholar and aristocrat who was distressed at what he saw to be the plight of the children in the overcrowded cities of England at the close of the 19th Century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Noting this picture of squalor and starvation, he determined to do something about it and formed the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Emigration Society at the turn of the century and eventually realised his dream in the form of Fairbridge House, a large old mansion in Western Australia which became the home for thousands of underprivileged English children who learned in the precincts of its spacious grounds the basics of farming and domestic work before taking their place in an Australian society which offered them much greater opportunity than would ever have been possible in their native England. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Though I see little television, I am concerned about the growing practice in our country of television advertising being directed towards children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it must be conceded that the directing of advertising towards children to promote adult usage and <span class="highlight">child</span> usage products pays handsome dividends to the advertiser. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe in particular that the aiming of adult usage product advertising towards children is creating dislocation which causes immediate problems and which will germinate in the relentless pursuit of the unattainable in adulthood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If honourable members can bear with me for a short time on this subject relating to local government, some of the people listening may be surprised to learn that the Federal Government gives block grants direct to local government for some of the following purposes: Pre-school and <span class="highlight">child</span> care services grants are made direct to local government authorities as set out on page 103 of Budget Paper No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-May I suggest to the honourable member for Brisbane  (Mr Peter Johnson)  that he reverse the role of performer and audience in relation to his children’s reading matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I understood him correctly, he said that it was a delight for him to read to his children from all the modern publications that were now used in schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real way of advancing children’s reading skill, basic to education, I would suggest to the honourable member, is for them to read to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Research on this aspect has been supported by the Thomas Coram <span class="highlight">Child</span> Centre at London University which has just completed a very interesting study of British schoolchildren in Dagenham. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The group of children selected had a comparable socioeconomic background. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would suggest that the best experiment for the honourable member for Brisbane to try would be not to read to them but to encourage the children to read to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the honourable member for Brisbane will find using this method that there will be an advance in the children’s reading age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our duty to the Australian school and the Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> is just as overwhelming and demanding as is that of any State government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore the <span class="highlight">child</span> goes to school less well equipped to take up the challenge of modern education, and that applies particularly to migrant children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Teaching a <span class="highlight">child</span> to read is the most fundamental responsibility which is owed to him by his school and the education system generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the honourable member for Fremantle had appreciated that the youngest <span class="highlight">child</span> of the honourable member for Brisbane is only 3 weeks old and that his other children are all under school age he would have understood the pleasure which the honourable member for Brisbane gets from reading stories to his children- as, I might say, I do to my own children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should be noted that, in classifying the persons surveyed in May 1973 as being responsible for children, responsibility was assigned, wherever possible, to a female- mother, stepmother, foster mother or female guardian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-36-2">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In consequence, in May 1973, there were only 4500 males in the workforce classified as being responsible for children under 6 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-36-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is an apparent increase of about $2,000m but $540m of that or about 6 percentage points of the increase on the previous year represents the loss of rebates to taxpayers for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in any reasonable assessment of what has happened to direct taxes this year, that has to be allowed for that $540m which is a straight transfer from tax to <span class="highlight">child</span> family allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the general concessional rebate for resident individuals, no tax was payable for the 1975-76 income year by a <span class="highlight">child</span> whose taxable income was less than $2,519 or by a trustee where the income to which a minor <span class="highlight">child</span> was presently entitled was less than $2,519. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-43-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the 1976-77 income year the concessional deduction or rebate to which a parent was entitled for the maintenance of a <span class="highlight">child</span> was reduced on a sliding scale, and the tax payable by the parent thus increased, where the separate net income of the <span class="highlight">child</span> exceeded a specified level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-43-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As from I July 1976 the replacement of rebates for dependent children by increased family allowances means that a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s separate income can no longer affect, by way of reduction in concessional rebates, the amount of tax payable by the parent or guardian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-43-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand, however, that in determining eligibility for payment of family allowance in respect of a student <span class="highlight">child</span> aged between 18 and 25 years, the amount of income of the student is taken into account in deciding whether the student is dependent on the claimant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-43-13">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In this regard, three points are made: the socio-economic category rating is a broad scheme that does not specifically identify pockets of need in otherwise relatively affluent areas; the placement of <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres needs to take into account such factors as major transport routes and thus convenience to clients who may not necessarily live in the immediate area of the centre; a number of centres being assisted under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act existed before that legislation was enacted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-43-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only last Monday night when opening the debate in the Parliament on taxation legislation I gave the example of a man with a wife and 2 children who received a taxable income of $10,000 a year, which is just over the figure for average weekly earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed out that after taking into consideration the increased <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment benefit, this man was now taking home over $5 a week less when adjustments were made for inflation and account was taken of the health taxes and the removal of rebates for dependants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This system greatly increases the amount that was previously paid in <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, under this system the mother in a family with 5 children receives a cheque for an amount of the order of $330 every quarter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is true that at the same time as this system was introduced the tax rebates for children were abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But for the higher income group of people it is practically a line-ball situation; what is received in additional family allowances matches what is lost through the abolition of tax rebates for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But for people in the lower income group, where incomes are not high enough and insufficient tax is paid to take advantage of the <span class="highlight">child</span> rebates, the amount received under the family allowance scheme represents a net gain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The following figures come from the nationwide survey of literacy and numeracy in Australian schools carried out by the ACER, and they are stark: Twentynine per cent of Australia’s 10-year old children and 27 per cent of 14-year old children are unable to understand written material which is no more difficult than the text books and reference books they use in their classrooms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately, one thing which can be said with complete certainty is that enormous numbers of today’s children are not mastering the reading skills which research shows clearly could be taught to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Select Committee was told, it is not dyslexia or specific learning difficulties which have landed us with the literacy problem, as much as teaching which fails to identify precisely where breakdowns have occurred in the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s acquisition of reading, to tackle them, and then retest to make sure that success has been achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Too frequently, withdrawal from the normal classroom setting leads to the <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s problem being seen as in his own ability or personality rather than in the qualities of  the teacher or  of the classroom itself, as is so often really the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are problems of learning difficulties, but if the word dyslexia’ is used to describe a supposed medical problem or supposed learning problem, that is dangerous in itself because it will lead parents and teachers to think that a particular <span class="highlight">child</span> is dyslexic, and, therefore, something is different about that <span class="highlight">child</span>, whereas the <span class="highlight">child</span> may merely have one of the many criteria of learning difficulties that we discovered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of this definition it is not practicable or desirable to set down a blanket rule that children with below-the-elbow or below-the-knee amputations are or are not entitled to Handicapped <span class="highlight">Child</span>’s Allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each claim is considered on its ments taking into account the severity of the handicap, any secondary disability and the ability of the <span class="highlight">child</span> to cope with his handicap. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The claim has provision for the parents to advise if appropriate, of the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s difficulties in eating, toilet, mobility, behaviour, speech, language, hearing and of the special care and attention provided including number of hours per day care is required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This assessment and the report completed by the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s supervising doctor are then considered by a Commonwealth Medical Officer employed by the Department of Health, who certifies whether the <span class="highlight">child</span> can be accepted as severely handicapped for the purpose of the allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised also that the Leader of the Opposition’s commitment to make <span class="highlight">child</span> care services available even to women who are not working could involve an additional cost of the order of $200m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Leader of the Opposition wants to claim that his speech last weekend contains no new commitments I suggest that in future he make it plain that a Labor government would make no changes to the present conditions under which women are eligible for the unemployment benefit and for assistance with <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to that, of course, the Government is showing much greater concern for and giving much greater attention to the provision of <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities where there are very real areas of need in the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many women and single parents in the Australian work force and unless there are adequate <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities, in a great many cases children are not properly looked after when their parents, whether they come from a 2 parent or a single parent family, are working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is estimated this financial year that $27m, I think- an amount approaching $30m at any rate- will be allocated for the provision of <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous Administration did virtually nothing in spite of the establishment of the Interim Children’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These include the examination of problems in certain areas; the establishment of an advisory council; advisory committees established by my colleague  Senator Guilfoyle  in respect of social security matters; and the examination of the feasibility of employment based <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we assume that there are more children in the electorate of Grey than in the other electorates, this highlights the need for an increase in the facilities by which these children can receive training in kindergartens and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Labor Government was in office it went a long way in assisting kindergartens and <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres under the Children ‘s Services Program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am told that the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centre at Whyalla is operating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  wrote to members of Parliament some 6 to 8 months ago announcing that the Government was going to change its emphasis on <span class="highlight">child</span> care services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people who will lose are not only the people who are running the kindergartens but also, more importantly, the children and their parents who rely on these forms of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As you will know, the Government has been anxious to reorient the Children’s Services Program to give greater emphasis to the provision of <span class="highlight">child</span> care services for families in need, particularly single parent and low income families where it is necessary for the mother of young children to go to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I read that letter I was all agog to find out what kindergartens were going to be assisted and what was going to happen about new <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that in future the Minister may be asked to perform the official opening of these <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that at the official opening of the <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres in the northern Spencer Gulf area the Minister will not, if she accepts the invitation to open them, take the credit for them because the credit does not belong to this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand it could be clearly stated that from the point of view of <span class="highlight">child</span>-bearing current patterns of marriage are extremely favourable to a higher level of fertility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could be suggested that the recent decline is only temporary as women have delayed their <span class="highlight">child</span>-bearing because of short term economic circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much of the decline in births since 1971 is due to women in their 20s having fewer children than women of a similar age did in the 1 960s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pattern of later marriage and delay in having the first <span class="highlight">child</span> is now well-established in the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This in turn has increased the opportunity costs or earnings forgone in having children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many of the source countries from which our migrants have come the family means not merely a dependent parent or a dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> but brothers and sisters and their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that although population will not be stationary because of past high levels of fertility and high inputs of young immigrants we have produced at the moment an age structure with a high proportion of young in <span class="highlight">child</span> bearing ages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the most significant of all is that any reversal in declining fertility or 2-<span class="highlight">child</span> families in Australia is unlikely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no evidence to suggest that the declining fertility or the trend for a 2-<span class="highlight">child</span> family in Australia will, in fact, be reversed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The grandfather of this <span class="highlight">child</span> probably will be able to meet the costs of all these things, but this <span class="highlight">child</span> is only the epitome of all children born in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This <span class="highlight">child</span> may be more fortunate than most. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I put to the House tonight that it should not adjourn but should stay in session until it resolves how children such as Travis Keith Johnson shall progress in this world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to those children who do not have the advantages that this <span class="highlight">child</span> may have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that a student receiving an isolated children’s allowance is debarred from a secondary education allowance, or a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s allowance, or vice versa? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such a <span class="highlight">child</span> may be entitled to an allowance under the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme as well as the Handicapped <span class="highlight">Child</span>’s Allowance if he is either undertaking an approved course of correspondence studies at home, or living with a relative to attend daily an institution for the handicapped because his family home is too far from the institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They knew that basic and needed programs for health care, hospitals, education, housing, the cities, recreation, transport, sewerage, <span class="highlight">child</span> care, sport, the environment would all suffer from the Fraser federalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without Federal intervention there would be no unbroken rail guages between the States; urban transport, particularly the railways, would still be burdened with antiquated equipment and rolling stock; young people would still have inadequate and unequal opportunities for secondary and tertiary education; and new initiatives in health centres, the environment and <span class="highlight">child</span> care would not have been considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sixthly, towards the end of this century Australia will need to spend relatively more on such things as aged pensions and other age related welfare schemes and relatively less- I am sad to say this- on such things as <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment, education, creches and the like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Higgins  (Mr Shipton)  was a member of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Specific Learning Difficulties and he knows very well that there are children in this country who are deprived of the opportunity of achieving their maximum level of educational development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is particularly so in the migrant area where, as I have pointed out a number of times, the migrant <span class="highlight">child</span> is trying to put his backside on 2 stools- he is losing his mother tongue and trying to learn English. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In many cases migrant children cannot achieve this objective and because of the inadequacy of our education services they are destined to fill the more meagre positions in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even if a long term sentence is imposed, the fear and dread of imprisonment is often negated by the lucky felon finding himself suddenly transported to some pleasant rural training farm cum holiday camp where the smell of pine forests and lucerne fields makes Alcatraz sound more like the king’s castle in some <span class="highlight">child</span>’s favourite fairy story. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs initiated a review at the suggestion of the honourable gentleman of what seems to be an alarming increase in the number of <span class="highlight">child</span> abductions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised as a result of that inquiry that the present position seems to be that for the issue of a passport to a <span class="highlight">child</span> under 17 years of age, the consent of both parents must be given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a provision for a parent to lodge with the Department of Foreign Affairs an application requesting that a passport be withheld from a <span class="highlight">child</span> when it is thought that abduction is likely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am told that there is no action the Department can take to prevent children from being removed from Australia if the children have citizenship of another country and travel on a passport of that other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 62 of the Migration Act, which comes within the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, requires that a parent should not remove a <span class="highlight">child</span> from Australia where there is an order of an Australian court entitling the other parent to access to or custody of that <span class="highlight">child</span>; in other words, irresepctive of the fact that the passport may not be an Australian passport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This provision of course does apply therefore to children of any nationality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 63 of that same Act, that is the Migration Act, makes provision for a parent to serve notice by statutory declaration upon carriers that they shall not, without reasonable excuse, permit a <span class="highlight">child</span> to leave a port or place in Australia for a destination outside Australia when such an order is in force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The review that was undertaken at the behest of the Minister for Foreign Affairs has indicated that within the ambit of the present responsibilities of the Department of Foreign Affairs therefore, there is little that can be done by it alone to prevent <span class="highlight">child</span> abduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as a result of the review an approach has been made to set up an interdepartmental committee to see whether, in conjunction with all departments, further steps might not be taken to ensure that <span class="highlight">child</span> abduction does not continue to the extent that it has in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What incentive is there for an Aboriginal <span class="highlight">child</span> to succeed in his educational studies if his father is unemployed and there is every likelihood that the <span class="highlight">child</span> may not be able to obtain employment at the conclusion of his or her education? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The resultant inactivity from unemployment, coupled with the payment of unemployment benefit, has led or contributed to deleterious social effects within the communities including: adverse attitudes of Aboriginal men to work severe drunkenness and associated violence health hazards, and <span class="highlight">child</span> neglect which occurs because some parents use their unemployment benefit for alcohol instead of food and clothing; and acute juvenile delinquency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Expenditure on the <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education program was to be cut by $983,400. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this time when we have high unemployment and a great need to use construction resources, it would be very efficient of our economic managers to look at the point of utilising unemployed personnel, equipment and resources in meeting the needs of school children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say and have said repeatedly that a <span class="highlight">child</span> never gets a second chance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the need is there for a <span class="highlight">child</span> now and it is not met, that <span class="highlight">child</span> cannot fill in the gap later on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is perhaps worth noting that in 1973 the average father of an independent school <span class="highlight">child</span> had a gross income of $12,000 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such families averaged 2.3 school age children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After tax rebates, parents spent $913 a year to educate each <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They still maintained an average of 2.3 school age children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But after tax they were required to spend $2,087 a year to educate each <span class="highlight">child</span> at an independent school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, whilst their income had gone up by approximately one-third-of course, allowing for taxation, the real increase would have been less than that- the cost of educating their children had more than doubled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great many people think of education as a weapon of their children’s advantage over everybody else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The adequate view for the Commonwealth or the States is that education is the instrument of every <span class="highlight">child</span>’s dignity, not the weapon of some children’s advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware of results of studies by prominent British psychiatrists who have found that children under the age of 3 years and who constantly lose the care of their mothers through hospitalisation or regular attendance at <span class="highlight">child</span> care institutions, suffer long term psychological and emotional damage? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government evaluate the results of such findings, or initiate its own research program in this area before making any long-term decisions about future <span class="highlight">child</span> care programs in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, in view of these findings, does the Minister think it advisable to consider a change in the direction of support for families by placing more emphasis on means tested income support schemes for parents of young children rather than devoting more resources to the building of <span class="highlight">child</span> care institutions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Government already makes a significant contribution towards assisting families to cope with the <span class="highlight">child</span> rearing functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In June 1976, there were 3 997 148 children under the age of 16 years in 1 935 596 families receiving allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In regard to the children’s services program, the Commonwealth has appropriated $73. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a service which benefits children from approximately 3 years to 5 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the balance is spent on a range of services of a nature designed to support the family and in particular to give expression to the Government’s wish to give <span class="highlight">child</span> care to needy families where the children otherwise would be without care of any kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of research studies have been funded in previous years under the children’s services program, some of them relating to psycho-social development of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, because of family allowances children are no longer included in that aspect of indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have deprived the taxpayer of a deduction for children, but we have now indexed zone allowances and other dependants allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps we should also index family allowances for each <span class="highlight">child</span> so that the value of the money received will remain the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words,  His  Honour clearly said to the Government: ‘You cannot direct Daniels, the DirectorGeneral, to deny this <span class="highlight">child</span> her unemployment benefit because you have laid down an economic policy that says that nobody is to get unemployment benefit’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we look at the amount of money provided to a man with 2 children- the figures have been frequently quoted by various people in this place- and at the amount of money which it is claimed by various people in this place is the cost of protection, we find that it is far more expensive to pay a person unemployment benefit, service his family with the $7.50 allowance per <span class="highlight">child</span>, and supply the free services which are provided under the social welfare program than it is to have a protected industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What difference does that make to anybody in the Australian community whose <span class="highlight">child</span>, who may well not even be of voting age or may be only 18 or so, goes into an office and is told: ‘We would be able to assist you under the State-administered means test but not under the federal test, which has been recommended by the Commission or in relation to which the Attorney-General has given us a direction under the agreement that the State concluded’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In broad terms, the sole parent rebate is available to taxpayers who have the sole care of a dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> or children under 16 or a dependent full-time student (or students) under 25. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-34-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If <span class="highlight">child</span> minding expenses up to a limit of $250 per <span class="highlight">child</span> were allowed as a deduction to “single” supporting parents who do not at present incur education expenses that may qualify for concessional rebate, the annual cost to revenue would be about $2m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-34-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, several requests are received each fortnight from the Department of Foreign Affairs seeking the assistance of this Force in the taking of preventive action on behalf of a parent granted custody of a <span class="highlight">child</span> who expresses a fear that the other partner to the marriage may attempt to remove a <span class="highlight">child</span> from Australia without consent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-41-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Department of Foreign Affairs would consider any request for repatriation of an Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> under the rules which are laid down for repatriation of Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-41-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Department has in fact repatriated some abducted children under those provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-41-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Department of Foreign Affairs has undertaken a review of the Passports Act and the review indicates that within the ambit of the present responsibilities of the Department of Foreign Affairs there is little that can be done by it alone to prevent <span class="highlight">child</span> abduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-41-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>An approach has therefore been made to set up an interdepartmental committee to see whether, in conjunction with other departments, further steps might be taken to help prevent <span class="highlight">child</span> abduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-41-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the case of  Mrs Calegero  ‘s <span class="highlight">child</span>, the Department of Foreign Affairs gave approval to the Australian Embassy Berne to provide a ticket to Australia for the <span class="highlight">child</span> subject to the usual undertaking to repay being given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-41-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a <span class="highlight">child</span> is to learn only for threequarters of an hour a day, although the teacher may be an excellent teacher the <span class="highlight">child</span> still has to go back into the class room and may well be prejudiced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Also the <span class="highlight">child</span> in the class room who has reached a certain stage of development for a certain school year may find that he is being held back in his learning because of the need for the teacher continually to pay special attention to children who are disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So, that total effect was that the increase in the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment was almost completely offset. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Converting the <span class="highlight">child</span> rebates into higher <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments meant that the Government avoided the expense of indexing those particular rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, in a full year, the net cost of the higher <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments was no more than the cost of indexing the <span class="highlight">child</span> rebates would have been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is on this basis that the Opposition is arguing that ‘the vast majority of taxpaying families’ would have been better off had the Government maintained the <span class="highlight">child</span> rebates and indexed them in 1976 and 1977 in the same way that the other rebates were indexed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To put the matter into perspective let me say that since 1972 fewer than 40 cases of <span class="highlight">child</span> abduction have been referred to my Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When parents separate and cannot agree about the care of their children, the law usually refers to the problem as a dispute about ‘custody’, a word which has overtones of the prison rather than the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Actually, a number of legal terms must be distinguished: A <span class="highlight">child</span>’s guardian is the person who is responsible for him- he has the right (and the duty) to make such decisions as where the <span class="highlight">child</span> will live and go to school, whether he will undergo serious medical treatment, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Formerly, the father was the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s guardian, but since the Family Law Act, which came into force on 5 January 1976, both parents are guardians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The word custody usually refers to the situation after a court has determined a dispute: The parent having custody is the one who lives with and looks after the <span class="highlight">child</span> from day to day, and makes most of the decisions affecting his life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other parent usually has access, which amounts to the right to visit the <span class="highlight">child</span> or have him stay with that parent at certain times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House will recall that last May I raised with the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  the matter of the appalling level of <span class="highlight">child</span> abductions in Australia in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of my concern about <span class="highlight">child</span> abductions and the difficulties that the Family Court faces I wrote a lengthy submission to the former Attorney-General and I shall make some reference to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One area which has frequently been exploited relates to a passport under which a <span class="highlight">child</span> or children may be lawfully taken out of the country on a passport that may have been obtained by one or other of the parents some time before proceedings in the Family Court commenced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In situations where the custody of the <span class="highlight">child</span> is paramount I think the passports ought to be surrendered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If neither party wants the <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s name presently on the passport to be changed during the proceedings the court need not intervene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regrettably, most <span class="highlight">child</span> abductions from this country affect people who are dual nationals holding dual passports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where an order made by a court (including a court of a prescribed overseas country) with respect to the custody of a <span class="highlight">child</span> is in force, a court having jurisdiction under this Act may issue a warrant authorising or directing the person, or any of the persons, to whom it is addressed to take possession of the <span class="highlight">child</span> and to deliver the <span class="highlight">child</span> to the person entitled to custody or to some other person or authority (including a person or authority in or from a prescribed overseas country) named in the order on behalf of the person entitled to custody. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the Minister for Special Trade Negotiations who represents the Attorney-General, to the House and to the Government that there must be a far more effective and efficient method for parents to have a warrant executed and the <span class="highlight">child</span> returned to them when a court order has been defied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had two cases drawn to my attention in which a parent obtained through the Social Security Department the address of a spouse who had defied the Family Court order for custody and abducted the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Public <span class="highlight">child</span> minding facilities for the children of witnesses and others who come to the court are provided also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the honourable member will find that the Department, after having received certain advice, will in fact provide particulars in an appropriate way to help locate a <span class="highlight">child</span> and have the <span class="highlight">child</span> taken from the offending parent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say quite categorically that I do not believe the abduction of a <span class="highlight">child</span> should be treated as a criminal matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To adopt a course will not result necessarily in bringing back the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ‘<span class="highlight">child</span>-napping’ or whatever one likes to call it, may well be a crime on the part of the parent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is no satisfaction to have the parent back and the <span class="highlight">child</span> somewhere in some other part of the world with his grandparents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The children of parents in the lower socioeconomic group are really suffering a burden, as the Karmel report clearly showed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission was set up in an effort to reverse that imbalance, on the basis that every <span class="highlight">child</span> should have an equal opportunity and on the basis that they should be supported by way of funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that at the end of the year, when you come up for examination, those who went to schools and who have had financial support, perhaps to the extent of $2,000, will do a lot better that the poor unfortunate <span class="highlight">child</span> who has had support to the extent of about $300. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the techniques, all the teaching aids, everything will be there for the children of the wealthy parents because the aids could be bought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children from the lower socio-economic group will have to do the best they can. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we get the present problem in Australia that because a <span class="highlight">child</span> might have poor parents he is to remain deprived and a victim of the environment into which he was born. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Schooling has become a social service which the Government has undertaken to provide and each <span class="highlight">child</span> is personally entitled under our present system to a certain amount each year towards the rising cost of his or her schooling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the individual <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s personal need for a suitable education that establishes its right to this money, a right it exercises through its parents or guardians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parents in turn have the responsibility and right of choosing for their children a school which meets their legitimate preferences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me when I consider the complications that might arise from this present Bill, which I support, that the simplest way of calculating the amount due to each <span class="highlight">child</span> would be to make it equal to the actual average cost, whether it be the local, region or State cost, of maintaining a place in a government school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is providing 20 per cent for a <span class="highlight">child</span> who might need 80 per cent or 100 per cent, yet honourable members opposite stand up here as Australians and talk about education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will name just a few of them: The States Grants (Home Care) Act, the sport and recreation grants, the area improvement program, <span class="highlight">child</span> care and preschool services, hospital and health services, community arts, the Regional Employment Development scheme and the Australian Assistance Plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These projects range from community health centres to day hospitals, day care centres, geriatric services, health education services, maternal and <span class="highlight">child</span> care services, drug and rehabilitation facilities, funding for community nursing and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a wife and a young <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter about which I speak this afternoon concerns the appropriation for the Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care and the payments to the States for which that Office has responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that, if we look at the lamentable record of the Fraser Government in the field of children’s services since it decided not to proceed with the establishment of a children’s commission and decided instead to establish a mere division within the Department of Social Security, we will see just how important institutions occasionally can be in flagging changes in government policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The lengths to which the Government has gone to conceal the change in policy and of heart which it has had about the support it is prepared to offer to <span class="highlight">child</span> care throughout Australia are extraordinary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first thing I point out is how oddly the estimates for <span class="highlight">child</span> care are constructed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is difficult to track payments to preschools, to family day care centres, to full day care centres and to other <span class="highlight">child</span> care projects such as pre-school centres, after-school centres and holiday school programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one could quarrel with the priorities the Government set for itself or at least announced in relation to family day care and for all its <span class="highlight">child</span> care projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government announced that it would give priority of access to single parent children, migrant children and children with special needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The consequence is that children within those categories are now no longer able to attend pre-school as their parents cannot afford it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will be filled by children from more affluent families who live in areas which may be more remote from these areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children will come the extra miles to get a place in a preschool because of the shortage in their own areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Director of the Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care conceded in testimony before the Senate Estimates committee dealing with this matter that in the last financial year in New South Wales there was still $6.8m worth of capital approvals outstanding for pre-school projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Sydney  (Mr Les McMahon)  has instanced in this place on several occasions recently the absurd position which has arisen in his electorate in the inner city part of Sydney around the Glebe area, where a brand new institution has been completed and children of residents in that district in a low income area of Sydney will not be able to afford to send their children to that pre-school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be used by the more affluent commuters to jobs in the city as a <span class="highlight">child</span>-minding centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That surely cannot be what the Government intended in relation to children’s services, but it is unmistakably the indirect result of the new directions of policy being set discreetly by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-We have just heard the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Antony Whitlam)  talking about the provision for pre-school education and <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What he failed to do was to indicate to the House his attitudes to the overall matter of the care and education of young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is time that the States exercised their responsibility and allocated greater proportions of funds into the area of childhood services, not merely into <span class="highlight">child</span> care or pre-school education but into services to support the family in order that children can be brought up by their families and given appropriate care and education so that when they do start school they can begin their formal education without disadvantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, a new scheme of family allowance has replaced the old <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and tax concession rebate arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until now the criteria for the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance have been that a severely handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> receives $15 a week if that <span class="highlight">child</span> is looked after by parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The criteria have been eased significantly, and now refer to a substantially handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>, particularly relating to low income families or families in necessitous financial circumstances because of the additional cost of looking after that <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-In speaking on the Estimates for the Department of Health this evening I raise the question of the link between <span class="highlight">child</span> neglect and drug taking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If a <span class="highlight">child</span> is annoying a mother by crying or playing up in some other way she may well be tempted to give the <span class="highlight">child</span> a dose of the sedative she herself is taking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was found that the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s throat had virtually been burnt out because she had had a near lethal dose of the sedative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we must remember that children can build up a tolerance to drugs and can start on the road to drug taking by parents giving them overdoses of these prescriptions or giving them when not prescribed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the opinion of some experts in the <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare field this mother had little chance of leading a normal life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The mother was shooting up, as they say, on heroin; the house in which she was living was raided by police; she was living with a prostitute and the house was frequented by addicts and dealers; the <span class="highlight">child</span> was not changed or bathed- and she thought that she was a good mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally I feel it is necessary to note that there is a distinct possibility that many Aboriginal children who fail to thrive, or who die through failure to present for medical aid in time,  are suffering from deliberate neglect, which is the only form of infanticide available to the people today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The children most likely to suffer from this fall into several quite simple categories- those of the unmarried girl, those who are the product of a  tribally-wrong  marriage, especially one that is incestuous as the people see it, and those born too close to a sibling; these almost certainly died in the past since the older <span class="highlight">child</span> has the unquestioned right to the mother’s milk until it no longer needs it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want briefly to raise a matter which concerns members of the Amputee Children’s Society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think many honourable members might have been a little concerned a short time ago when the Press revealed that a deaf girl, who had been receiving the handicapped children’s allowance, was to lose that allowance because her parents were making an endeavour to normalise her attitudes as much as possible by admitting her to a state school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although there were very great problems involved in her attending a state school, including problems of transportation and the like, and certainly problems in relating to other children and problems in hearing lessons and so on, on balance it was felt by the parents and people who were advising them that this was a beneficial thing for the <span class="highlight">child</span> to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, because the <span class="highlight">child</span> attended a state school, the allowance has been taken away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have in front of me a copy of a letter sent to a parent of an amputee <span class="highlight">child</span> which spells out the Government’s intention to impose this means test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allowance will be paid where a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s disabilities are adjudged on medical grounds to be marginally below what constitutes ‘severely handicapped’ as defined in the legislation and the family income does not exceed the adult minimum weekly wage (‘Six Capital Cities’), at present $1 10.60 per week, plus $6 for each <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be paid at the rate of SIS a week or the amount of expenditure associated with the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s disability, whichever is the lesser. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed means test of $1 10.60 per week, which is the level of the minimum weekly wage, plus the allowance of $6 for each <span class="highlight">child</span> would naturally have the effect of excluding a very large number of families who at present receive the benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1) and (2) While the exact nature of the Commonwealth Government’s involvement in Australia’s observance of the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> in 1979 has yet to be finalised, an interdepartmental committee has met a number of times to discuss and co-ordinate the efforts of a number of Commonwealth departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-35-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has made a decision to work with both State governments and voluntary organisations in the celebrations of this Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-35-15">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I desire to ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs a question relating to the fostering of Aboriginal children under the laws of a State or the Commonwealth when the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s home is unsatisfactory and the <span class="highlight">child</span> is taken from the parents for the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s safety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, is the <span class="highlight">child</span> fostered, if possible, to a satisfactory Aboriginal family, having regard to the overtones from the past in taking an Aboriginal <span class="highlight">child</span> from his own race? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is wise to foster the <span class="highlight">child</span> to a European family, are steps taken for the <span class="highlight">child</span> to maintain some contact with Aboriginal people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education, in 1976 we provided $23,254,000 through the Schools Commission’s general current grants program for <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, in 1976-77 some $534,870 was provided for other services for <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So again, funds have increased for <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister were serious about <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education he would never be out of the office of the Minister for Education  (Senator Carrick),  because funds are being cut in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Persons who have come to this country to establish a new life and a new future for themselves and their children are having that vision shattered as a result of the partisan attitude of the Government and particularly of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They do not have a person who can stay at home and look after children; so they have to pay for <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are the parents of those children who attend private schools not entitled to a contribution from the public purse similar to that received by the parents of children attending government schools? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all they are taxed on the same basis, their children have the same needs and some of those private and independent schools are showing us things that we need to learn that will benefit all children, including those in the government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The guidelines that the Government put down were in line with its long announced policy that at least 20 per cent of the cost of educating a <span class="highlight">child</span> in any school system should be provided from the public purse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some children have the cost of their entire education met from the taxpayers’ dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Moore  (Mr Hyde)  seemed to be putting that every <span class="highlight">child</span> should have an equal opportunity and that we should not interfere with the existing system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission clearly established that children in Australia now have nothing like an equal opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The resources that parents want to devote to the education of their <span class="highlight">child</span> could be as high as $ 1 ,400 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no good talking about that being the norm for every <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia, because the same resource allocation is not available to all in the competitive education system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But surely everybody would agree that if the resource allocation norm is $1,400 every <span class="highlight">child</span> ought to have $1,400 available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is now a subsidy of 32 per cent for more than 300,000 children, but the Government says that it does not matter, that levels 1 and 2 will be increased to 20 per cent and will receive $2m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At present handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance of $15 a week is payable to parents or guardians in respect of a severely physically or mentally handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 years of age who is cared for at home and who, because of the severity of the handicap, requires constant care and attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance is designed to assist in meeting the exceptional costs incurred by parents or guardians who p refer to care for a severely handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> at h ome rather than to place the childin an institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has come to notice that there are a number of low income families caring for a <span class="highlight">child</span> who is substantially handicapped but not severely handicapped and for whom handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance is not paid because the medical criteria are not fully met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is aware of the additional costs that can be incurred in caring for a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> at home and that it places a strain- often a severe strain- on the finance of low-income parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These expenses can arise out of the need to provide special footwear or other clothing, special diets or specific medical or remedial treatment that the parents of other children are not required to provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Director-General of Social Services, at his discretion, will be able to grant a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance of up to $15 a week to a person on low income who is caring for a substantially handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allowance will be payable in respect of a <span class="highlight">child</span> whose substantial handicap does not fully meet the existing medical criteria but where, because of continuing substantial expenditure associated with the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s disability, the parent or guardian is, in the Director-General’s opinion, suffering severe financial hardship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The zero rate is generally not to apply in respect of income to which no beneficiary is presently entitled, or to income of a trust set up during the lifetime of the settlor where an infant <span class="highlight">child</span> under 16 years of age is presently entitled to the income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for those reasons that while the Opposition welcomes the statement it is disappointed to think that the money could not have been made available at the time of the Budget, at the time there were negotiations between officers of the States and the Commonwealth as to what the needs were in not only adult migrant education but also <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He will see that in the fields of adult migrant education and <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education the Commonwealth should be making available a much more substantial sum than the $ 11.8m now provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 100 per cent General Rate for a wife is $4.05 per week and $1.38 per week for each eligible <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-91-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the 1976 Budget, the Government introduced the system of family allowances to replace <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and tax rebates for dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the 1975-76 system of tax rebates and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment had continued and if the <span class="highlight">child</span> rebate had been indexed in line with other rebates, thousands upon thousands of taxpaying families, the vast majority- in fact all on $240 a week or less, which I believe constitute about 80 per cent of tax-paying families- would be better off now than under the proposed tax scales we are now debating, plus the present family allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The disadvantage under the family allowance system varies from $1.80 for a family with one <span class="highlight">child</span> to $5.30 for a family with five children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This comparison reveals that a family with five children and an income of $200 a week will be over $6 a week worse off as a result of this Government’s tax changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, a family with one <span class="highlight">child</span> and an income of $400 a week will be over $7 a week better off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Trusts formed for children by a living trustee will be exempt from taxation on incomes below $1,040. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the more common trusts is where the mother, father or parent has a trust for their children and where the income is below $1,040 it will not be taxable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A trust for an infant <span class="highlight">child</span>, which is the proceeds of a will, will have a tax exemption level of $3,750. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When the Treasurer introduced these Bills, he said that the provisions will ensure that ordinary trusts for children under 16 years of age will not be called on to pay tax where the income is under $ 1 ,04 1 , which I have just mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have advocated for years in this House- and it finally came to pass- that it would be better to take <span class="highlight">child</span> concessions out of the Income Tax Act altogether and to look after this area by means of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has taken <span class="highlight">child</span> concessions out of the Income Tax Act and is relying on <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are: General resources programs- general recurrent grants, including funds for <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant and multicultural education, emergency aid for nongovernment schools, and capital grants; specific purpose programs- disadvantaged schools and schools in disadvantaged country areas, special education for handicapped children including children living in institutions, services and development including education centres, and special projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It abolished <span class="highlight">child</span> rebates and instead significantly increased the rates of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments, which it renamed ‘family allowances.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Converting the <span class="highlight">child</span> rebates into higher <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments meant that the Government avoided the expense of indexing those particular rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, in a full year, the net cost of the higher <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment payments was no more than the cost of indexing the <span class="highlight">child</span> rebates would have been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is on this basis that the Opposition is arguing that ‘the vast majority of taxpaying families’ would have been better off had the Government maintained the <span class="highlight">child</span> rebates and indexed them in 1976 and 1977 in the same way that the other rebates were indexed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill gives no indication of how the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance will be applied or how the Director-General will decide whether a particular instance causes severe financial hardship to the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have received complaints from my electorate, and I am sure that other people received them last year, from persons who were completely unable to look after their school leaver children at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What I find particularly unpleasant is the fact that the family allowance stops when the <span class="highlight">child</span> leaves school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is fair enough if the <span class="highlight">child</span> can find a job, but we all know that it will be very difficult this year, as it was last year- it will be even more difficult this year- for young people to find a job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There may be the case of a widow, or any other person receiving social security benefits, whose children have been entitled to a benefit of, I think, $7.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The children have been entitled to a family allowance, depending on their position in the family, of at least $3.50 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">child</span> then has the additional costs of trying to find a job- the costs of going to the Commonwealth Employment Service office, going to the office of the Department of Social Security, ringing up, buying newspapers which advertise jobs and that sort of thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When one of the children reaches the age of 16 or 18 years and leaves school, and after a period of six weeks has not found a job, that family, provided the <span class="highlight">child</span> is under 18 years, will receive $36 a week, and if the <span class="highlight">child</span> is over 1 8 years the family will receive, I think, $49.30 a week even though there is a parental income of $500, $600 or $700 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A benefit shall not be granted to a person who is a supporting parent unless the Director-General considers that it is reasonable that the supporting parent should have taken action to obtain maintenance from the person or persons who is or are the father or fathers, or the mother or mothers, as the case may be, of the <span class="highlight">child</span> or children in relation to whom the first-mentioned person is the supporting parent and that that person has taken such action to obtain such maintenance as the Director-General considers reasonable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do appeal to the Schools Commission to come back to the conception we had about its work, that is, that it is quite irrelevant to the Commonwealth whether an Australian citizen happens to be a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a government school or a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a non-government school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771107_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have in front of me a comparison of the amounts spent on migrant adult and <span class="highlight">child</span> education under the last Hayden Budget of 1975-76, as it has become known, and under the present Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Expenditure on the adult program in 1975-76 was $8,231,313 and expenditure on the <span class="highlight">child</span> program was $21,814,753. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this Budget year, 1977-78, the amount for the adult program has been raised to $1 1,878,000, which is the largest amount of money ever spent in Australia on adult migrant education, and the amount for the <span class="highlight">child</span> program has been raised to $26,005,500, which again is the largest amount ever provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe it to be a great waste of resources to push a <span class="highlight">child</span> or a person through 12 years of schooling, six years of which are at high school, cramming the brain with subjects that are of absolutely no use in a chosen vocation until at the age of 1 8 the person commences training possibly for a trade, possibly for an office job or possibly for an academic career. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me that there must be changes in our education system itself and that government moneys must and should be spent for the benefit of the nation -for the benefit of our children certainly- but not as it seems apparent today for the benefit of school teachers- a group which is treated as another holy cow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In October 1976 the present Government updated the payments to, I think, $80 per week for the injured person, $2 1 for his wife and $10 for each <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reason I put this proposition to the Government is that it is totally inequitable for the present situation to continue when the Government has now determined that death and gift duties should be removed, and in fact have been removed in regard to estates passing between parent and <span class="highlight">child</span> and husband and wife as at 2 1 November last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it sensible to penalise the parent who sends his <span class="highlight">child</span> to a private school, but who is poorer than a wealthy parent who sends his <span class="highlight">child</span> to a public school? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The legislation, firstly, will provide that no estate duty will be payable by the estate of a person dying on or after 2 1 November 1977 in respect of property passing to the spouse, a <span class="highlight">child</span> or a parent of the deceased person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All of these consumer organisations- let us call them that; I refer also to associations of hospital patients in particular hospitals and parent and <span class="highlight">child</span> care organisationsshould be brought into that review procedure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am informed that State and Territory <span class="highlight">child</span> welfare authorities have stated that 1 96 of the children in question have now been adopted and the adoption of the majority of the remaining children is pending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remember what happened when I was in medical practice and I was dealing with children suffering from measles or some other common complaint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The vast majority of children with measles will recover from that condition and no specific treatment is necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A proportion of children will have complications, such a chest infections, ear infections and possibly encephalitis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is wrong to put the onus on the mother or father of the <span class="highlight">child</span> to decide whether to have that <span class="highlight">child</span> completely checked at the appropriate time and pay $10 or $14 for that to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A large number of people will wrongly decide- I emphasise the words ‘wrongly decide’- that they will not obtain treatment for a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> may then contract a significant chest infection, such as pneumonia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may reach the stage of bronchiectasis We know that a large number of children with that disease suffered firstly from one of the relatively minor virus diseases of childhood, of which measles is one of the most common. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before I am finished my speech, if we consider the averages, one <span class="highlight">child</span> will have been killed and disposed of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is not the killing of an unborn baby; it is the killing of a living <span class="highlight">child</span> which has proceeded from the body of its mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another method of killing the <span class="highlight">child</span> before birth is exsanguination, by which the baby’s umbilicus is drawn outside the woman’s body and cut to allow the baby to bleed to death while it is unborn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s decisions mean that no estate duty will be payable by the estate of a person dying on or after 21 November 1977 in respect of property passing to the surviving spouse, a <span class="highlight">child</span>, a grandchild, a parent or a grandparent of the deceased person, and no gift duty will be payable on property given by a person on or after that date to relatives within those classes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One effect of the proposed amendments will be that gift dutywill not be payable in respect of gifts made on or after 2 1 November 1977 to the extent that they are for the benefit of the spouse, a <span class="highlight">child</span>, a grandchild, a parent or a grandparent of the donor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I find it difficult to justify, for example, that Australia’s assistance to young marrieds with children is one of the lowest in the world at the same time as it should be considering, and rightly so, an increased migration policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to take this opportunity to remind honourable members of the fraud associated with replacing our system of tax rebates and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment with the family allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But now every taxpaying family with children is much worse off than it was under Labor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I seek leave to incorporate in  Hansard  a table which compares the rates paid to tax paying families under the family allowance scheme with those paid under the tax rebate and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this table the $200 <span class="highlight">child</span> rebate introduced in the 1975-76 Hayden Budget has been indexed in line with other tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under indexation the <span class="highlight">child</span> rebate in 1977-78 would have been at least $250 per <span class="highlight">child</span>- that is $4.82 per <span class="highlight">child</span> per week for a taxpaying family calculated on the basis of indexing $200 by 13 per cent in 1976-77 and by 10.9 per cent in 1977-78. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The tax rebate which has now been lost in respect of a family with just one <span class="highlight">child</span> is $4.80 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore a family with one <span class="highlight">child</span> would have received $5.30 a week under our system even if the level of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment had not at any stage been increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment would have been 50c for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> and $ 1 for the second <span class="highlight">child</span> making a total of $1 1.10 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The family allowances introduced by this Government are $3.50 for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> and $5 for the second <span class="highlight">child</span>, making a total of $8.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Similarly, for a family with three children the loss is $3.40 a week, for a family of four children it is $4.45, for a family of five children it is $4.75 and for a family of six children $5.30 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If ever a thimble and pea trick were played on the Australian family man and woman it was done by his Government when it decided to cut out the tax rebate for dependent children and introduce family allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is made all the worse by the fact that had the tax rebates for dependent children continued they would have been indexed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tax rebate for a person with one <span class="highlight">child</span> would have been $4.80 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The family allowance for a person with one <span class="highlight">child</span> is now $3.50 a week, instead of the 50c a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, had the tax rebate been still operative and had it been indexed as the Government undertook, a person with one <span class="highlight">child</span> would have been getting $4.80 a week compared with $3.50 a week today- a loss of $1.80 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person with one <span class="highlight">child</span> is $ 1.80 a week worse off; a person with two children is $2.60 a week worse off; a person with three children is $3.40 a week worse off; and a person with four children is $4.45 a week worse off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although it is now the prerogative of the States to determine their own means testing for housing commission accommodation one would expect that since the waiting list is so long, and Federal finance is so pitiful, the Labor States would probably continue to impose a means test similar to the one set out in the table I have incorporated in  Hansard  with an extra $2 1 a week allowed for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> and another $25 a week allowed for a second <span class="highlight">child</span> of a different sex, and so on, as shown in the table. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If in this example it is necessary to travel by air, the costs of return economy class air travel for the parent and the <span class="highlight">child</span> amount to $204.20, and when one adds the cost of accommodation for say 2 days and nights, the total cost to the parents could be of the order of a further $60. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, in certain circumstances, usually a <span class="highlight">child</span> under 14 years of age and as provided in the new section 14, a patient may be accompanied by both an attendant and an escort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It provides that, commencing in the 1978-79 income year, where a <span class="highlight">child</span> of a divorced or separated couple would, under the existing law, be taken to be a dependant for levy purposes of both parents, the <span class="highlight">child</span> will be taken to be a dependant solely of the parent who is paid family allowances for the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The provisions of the Bill cover the following: Indexation of pensions and benefits; age pensions for persons aged 70 or more; rationalisation of payments for children; family allowances, including handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance and double orphan’s pension; maternity allowance; and payment of benefits in respect of children living abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance of $15 a week is payable to parents or guardians in respect of a <span class="highlight">child</span> under the age of 1 6 years who is cared for at home and who, because of the severity of the handicap, is in need of constant care and attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subject to the discretion of the DirectorGeneral, a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s allowance is also payable, wholly or in part, where a person has the custody, care and control of a substantially handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> and, as a consequence of continuing substantial expenditure associated with the <span class="highlight">child</span>’s disability, the person suffers financial hardship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Bill gives effect to the Government’s decision to extend payment of handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s allowance for full-time students aged between 1 6 and 25 years, providing the <span class="highlight">child</span> is not receiving an invalid pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Existing provisions allow continuation of payment of handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s allowance for not more than 30 days in the case of severely handicapped children who are temporarily absent from the family home but exclude those who are not severely handicapped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to make provisions regarding children uniform the Government has also decided that the upper age limit of 25 years for payment of family allowance and double orphan’s pension will also apply to payment of additional pension and additional unemployment or sickness benefit for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has also decided to preclude payment of family allowance and double orphan’s pension where the <span class="highlight">child</span> receives an invalid pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Social Services Act provides that family allowance, including double orphan’s pension and handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance shall be payable in respect of endowment periods as determined by the Director-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Act stands at present the Department of Social Security has been advised that it is possible for two people to be paid a full family allowance for the same <span class="highlight">child</span> at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill therefore proposes to remedy this deficiency by giving the Director-General discretion to apportion payments on such basis as he determines where he is satisfied that two persons are each qualified to receive payment in respect of the same <span class="highlight">child</span> at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, where parents living permanently apart have joint custody of, or joint access to, a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provisions in the Social Services Act currently enable family allowance, including handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance and double orphan’s pension, and additional pension or supporting parent’s benefit or additional unemployment or sickness benefit for children to be paid for a <span class="highlight">child</span> living abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of this the Bill provides that such payments will not in future be made for children outside Australia unless: A <span class="highlight">child</span> is temporarily abroad; a <span class="highlight">child</span> is living abroad pending migration to Australia within four years after the commencement of the benefit; and in respect of additional pension/benefit a <span class="highlight">child</span> is living abroad with a person who is himself receiving an Australian pension or benefit overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the Government’s view that the <span class="highlight">child</span> of a Service pensioner will have had sufficient time to embark upon and complete his full-time education and attain appropriate qualifications to facilitate entry into a chosen vocation by the time he attains 25 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is now proposed that an upper disqualifying age limit of 25 years be applied in respect of the additional allowances paid to Service pensioners who are supporting student children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, allowances already in payment in respect of student children 25 years and over will continue while students are undertaking full-time education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The table shows clearly that, because of the Government’s failure to index family allowances, a family with one <span class="highlight">child</span>, provided there is a taxpayer in the family, loses $2.16 a week; a family with two children loses $3.32 a week; a family with three children loses $4.48 a week and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 indicates the Government’s decision no longer to pay outside Australia family allowances, orphans’ pensions and handicapped children’s allowances unless the <span class="highlight">child</span> is temporarily abroad, living abroad pending migration to Australia and living abroad with a person receiving the Australian pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is not, we place a family with dependent children in a disadvantaged position in comparison with a family that has the same income but no dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In time we will need to give consideration to increasing the family allowance paid in respect of the first <span class="highlight">child</span> and in respect of children under the age of six. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the curtailment of expenditure with the addition of a <span class="highlight">child</span> is striking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should say that under our social security system we do make special provisions for families where there are children with a single parent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>secondly, the addition of a <span class="highlight">child</span> to a two adult household clearly means a fall in average income- a fall that must be all the more traumatic because of the high expenditure patterns of the two adult households before the event of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>In the many cases income losses and higher expenditure associated with the onset of <span class="highlight">child</span> bearing are eased again when the children come to school age and the mother can take up employment on a part or full time basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I draw to the attention of the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt),  who in this House represents the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle),  the need for the Government to look at the total family allowance program and the need as circumstances permit to ask the question whether when we increase those benefits to maintain their real value we should not at the same time make a substantial increase in real value of the payments made in respect of the first <span class="highlight">child</span> particularly while that first <span class="highlight">child</span> is in the pre-school age group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an unfortunate reality that she has to emphasise that whilst there are laws against the exploitation of children in the labour market, there are no laws in this country against their exploitation in pornograpic publications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When did it become ‘bigoted, illogical, repressive and reactionary’ to desire to protect little children from being used in pornography or to desire to promote a loving, caring community of families in this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely the decent ALP members in this House can be ashamed of the student club either for its unintelligent foolishness in thoughtlessly condemning something on which it did not bother to get some hard facts; or worse, for its implicit support for the disgusting exploitation that  Mrs Whitehouse  opposes and its implicit denial of the value of the family as the basic unit of society and the best haven for the growing <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw to the attention of the House a quite serious situation that has arisen in New South Wales because of the obsolescence of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act of 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  has recently, for the purposes of payment of recurrent subsidies, approved graduates from some <span class="highlight">child</span> care certificate courses as equivalent to a nurse under section 11(5) of Part III of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act of 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The point is that all of these colleges which provide courses in <span class="highlight">child</span> care follow the same curriculum and their graduates submit to the same external examinations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some six months ago the New South Wales <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Association requested an amendment of the Act to allow the recurrent subsidy for teachers to be paid to the pre-schools employing graduates from all of these colleges, not just from the three designated in the 1 976 Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How can it be claimed that that situation will ‘threaten the future education of every <span class="highlight">child</span> attending a government school ‘ when on the figures accepted by the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority there are only 13 fewer teachers than it wanted, in a system employing 2,772 teachers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Total government borrowings overseas has now reached the level where the Government owes foreign financiers $280 for each man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> in this country, compared with only $90 a head when the Fraser Government took over in November 1 975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we take them into consideration, for each man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> in this country, we are going to be owing $320 as against the $90 at the time the Fraser Government came to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is the same man who said a fortnight ago in Sydney again that his Government had given greater emphasis to <span class="highlight">child</span> care oblivious of the simple fact that in 1975-76 in our last Budget we allocated $64m for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a member of this Parliament decides he wants to provide, say, $3,000 a year for one of his children who is attending university or a college of advanced education, the family allowance for that <span class="highlight">child</span> will still be intact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a relative sense that payment will represent no great sacrifice as against the sort of sacrifice of providing just a modest level of support for a student <span class="highlight">child</span> of a person on a modest to lower middle income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In real terms a family is worse off now as against 1975 by between $2.96 in the case of one dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> and $7.86 in the case of three dependent children if one makes an allowance for the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and tax rebate which Labor introduced in late 1975 and which were effective from the beginning of 1976, updated according to cost of living movements and measured against the family allowances paid at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed I suggest that we might think in terms of allowing the family allowance at some time in the future, when finances permit, to be paid during the period when women are expecting a <span class="highlight">child</span> so as to assist them with preliminary expenses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we had continued with the Labor Party scheme, the so-called Hayden scheme, under which a tax rebate of $200- not a deduction from taxable income but an actual rebate- was introduced in the 1975-76 Budget, to be indexed in line with other tax rebates, that rebate would now be $269 per <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is $5.16 per week per <span class="highlight">child</span> for a taxpaying family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under our scheme, a family with one <span class="highlight">child</span> would have received a tax rebate of $5. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 6 a week plus <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment of 50c, making a total payment of $5.66 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A family with two children would have been entitled to a tax rebate of $10.32 a week, with <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment of $1 for the second <span class="highlight">child</span> and 50c for the first <span class="highlight">child</span>, making a total of $11.82 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That family now receives $3.50 for the first <span class="highlight">child</span> and $5 for the second <span class="highlight">child</span>, making a total of $8.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, for a family with three children there is a loss of $4.48, for a family with four children a loss of $5.89, for a family with five children a loss of $6.55, and for a family with six children a loss of $7.46 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not indexing family allowances; it is abolishing family allowances for those children in receipt of allowances under prescribed educational schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the Government is taking away the family allowance from those parents whose children qualify to receive a benefit under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and other schemes, yet it is not removing the family allowance from those people who earn much more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a parent earns a very large amount of money, earns too much for his student <span class="highlight">child</span> to receive the TEAS allowance, and is able to send his <span class="highlight">child</span> to university or to some other tertiary institution, there is no attempt to remove the family allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Director General considers that it is reasonable that the supporting parent should have taken action to obtain maintenance from the person or persons who is or are the father or fathers or the mother or mothers as the case may be of the <span class="highlight">child</span> or children in relation to whom the first mentioned person is the supporting parent and that that person has taken such action to obtain such maintenance as the Director General considers reasonable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A benefit shall not be granted to a person who is a supporting parent if the Director General considers that it is reasonable that the supporting parent should have taken action to obtain maintenance from the person or persons who is or are the fathers or fathers or the mother or mothers as the case may be of the <span class="highlight">child</span> or children in relation to whom the first mentioned parent is the supporting parent and that person has not taken such action to obtain such maintenance as the Director General considers reasonable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the first case, the unemployed household with two dependent children will by November 1979 have fallen $20 below the poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the case of the single parent with <span class="highlight">child</span> the gap will have reached $25. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We find under the existing arrangements that no family can receive at one and the same time a family allowance and a Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowance, that the one <span class="highlight">child</span> family is better off by $1.75 a week, that the two-<span class="highlight">child</span> family is better off by 25c a week and that the five-<span class="highlight">child</span> family is worse off by $ 1.75 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I speak in particular of young families which are faced with the burden of having an extra <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of means testing the family allowance was raised in another context in the Budget, and we all know that the Government changed its mind on the question of the abolition of the family allowance as far as the income of children is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the case in which the <span class="highlight">child</span> is being used as part of a tax avoidance scheme and has significant income via a family trust or some  othersimilarmethod.Itisverydifficulttojustify  the payment of the family allowance to such families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there will be no abolition of the family allowance in the case of other families whose children are attending tertiary institutions up to the age of 25 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fact is, first of all, that the amounts given to mothers on the birth of a <span class="highlight">child</span> have stayed the same for 30 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The argument used by the Minister- it contains a certain amount of logic- is that because of the extent to which a universal health scheme pays the bills for childbirth this concept might be redundant, but what the Minister is overlooking and what those who drafted this proposal have overlooked is that the purchase of basic equipment for the <span class="highlight">child</span> was part of the original concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister goes back and examines the position he will also see that it was built into the original concept that in many cases the period of childbirth, particularly with low income families, would involve some possible loss of earnings to the mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well, when we talk about expenses associated with the birth of children, there is the actual establishment for looking after the new born babe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a time when expense is high- when a <span class="highlight">child</span> needs clothing, all the various equipment for feeding and all the various equipment for sleeping. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we are looking at the maternity allowance we should be looking not purely at the hospital and medical costs of confinement and childbirth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A family receiving an income of $8,600 a year- that is the threshold of the means test operative in relation to TEAS payments- and having a dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> receiving a TEAS payment will lose its family allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can advise the House of a personal experience whereby a specialist refused to operate on a sick <span class="highlight">child</span> because in 1975 I preferred to remain in Medibank Standard which of course offered 85 per cent of medical fees and free treatment in standard hospital wards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The most important of these concern, firstly, the new section 7- inserted by clause 8 of the Bill- which will enable an employee to continue to work closer than 6 weeks before the expected date of confinement provided the leave officer agrees and a medical certificate is provided; a similar provision will enable an employee to resume duty earlier than 6 weeks after the birth of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The area which has consumed the major portion of energy and funds is teaching English to non-English speaking children of school age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since 1971, the Commonwealth Government’s <span class="highlight">child</span> migrant education program has concentrated on teaching English to immigrant children who were unable to participate adequately in mainstream classroom activities because of insufficient knowledge of English. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Probably all of us, who are of another generation, were brought up with the well-known attitude about a woman’s place: A man got married expecting his wife to look after the home, have children and look after him when he got home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That attitude is changing and the younger generation- I suppose I can include people of my own age in that group- are now changing their attitudes towards what each partner will do; who will go to work, who will look after the children, do the washing up, wash the nappies and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is also likely that many women are prevented from returning to work because of inadequate <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities, lack of part-time work, restriction of the period of unpaid leave, or a combination of those factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Instead of withdrawing provisions which certainly were not generous when compared with those operating in other countries, the Government should be facilitating the establishment of maternity and paternity leave provisions in the private sector; providing adequate <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities instead of reversing advances made by the Labor Government in this area; exploring ways of providing adequate permanent part-time work for government employees with young families, and encouraging the private sector to follow suit; and, finally, investigating the effects of making provision for easier re-entry or retention of career rights for women who stay out of the work force longer to look after children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With 40 weeks leave available in addition to the 12 weeks, if that person commanded a salary of $200 a week, during that period she would receive a subsidy of some $8,000 from the taxpayers’ purse to have a <span class="highlight">child</span>, and that is a subsidy not available to most other Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the honourable member were to look at the amendments which were announced in the 1 977 Budget he would realise that there is very little advantage to be gained today from setting up a trust for a <span class="highlight">child</span> under the age of 16 and that there is very little avenue for a zero rating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The approach in trying to implement this policy has usually been to withdraw the nonEnglish speaking children into remedial classes so that their language difficulty is equated with physical or mental handicap. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the outset, I wish to pay tribute to the pioneers in this Parliament who in the years gone by have been the people who were responsible for the injection of Commonwealth funds into the education of the Australian <span class="highlight">child</span> and the Australian adult. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Quite rightly, the honourable member for Maribyrnong cited increases in certain areas in terms of dollars but I believe he did not quote the salient factor, that is, that, in the Level 1 schools, the percentage of standard costs which the Government bears by way of general recurrent grants for students is 1 6 per cent of the estimated costs of educating a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a government primary school for a year, namely, $845. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our philosophy is that each <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia, irrespective of the income of his parents, is entitled to some basic contribution to help his or her education in a school of the choice of the parents by virtue of the fact that they are taxpayers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the States are going to adopt that approach they should also display at the entrance to every college of advanced education and university a sign stating: ‘Your <span class="highlight">child</span> attends here by virtue of the generosity of the Federal Government. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party is determined that every <span class="highlight">child</span> who embarks on secondary education in 1973 shall, irrespective of school or location, have as good an opportunity as any other <span class="highlight">child</span> of completing his secondary education and continuing his education further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What has to be recognised in Australia is the power of simple snobbery and the extent to which education is regarded as a weapon to ensure the advantage of ‘our <span class="highlight">child</span> over their <span class="highlight">child</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps there is a growing tendency to regard education not as a weapon of advantage, but as an instrument of the dignity of all children and young people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One way is simply by income splitting, by diverting one’s income through trusts towards children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the law currently stands, any income of a <span class="highlight">child</span> beneficiary up to a total of $16,608 is taxed at 33V4 per cent and at only 47V4 per cent up to $33,216. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the father is taxed at the maximum marginal rate of 6 1 te per cent, he can still save a lot of tax by putting his income through a trust for distribution to his children who then pay tax at a much lower rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the interesting point is that the parents can still utilise that income, perhaps to some degree by normal parental control over the financial affairs of their children but, if that is too blatant, the Australian Taxation Office can then demand that higher tax be paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The children may lend the money back to the trusts- that is, another collapsible loan; one not intended for repayment- which increases the capital of the trusts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the parents have channelled income to the children who have paid tax at a much lower rate and then the money comes back to the parents through the supposed repayments of the loan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In section 102 of Division 6 there was thought to be a major deterrent to tax avoidance through income splitting by providing for penalty tax to be paid where income is payable for the benefit of unmarried children under 21 from a trust created by the children’s parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the High Court ruled in 1 957 that section 102 did not apply if a <span class="highlight">child</span> was only contingently entitled to income from the trust, that is, if property was settled on the trust for an infant subject to his attaining, say, the age of 25 or marrying before that age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also in 1970 the High Court in what is known as Truesdale’s Case also ruled that the section had no application if the trust is created by someone other than the parent or the <span class="highlight">child</span> beneficiary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This would rule out the application of section 102 in the usual case- very much the usual case now- where a settler creates the trust with a nominal amount and the parent then transfers assets to the trust for the benefit of his own children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matters raised in this Bill are matters of great concern to every citizen of this nation because they affect the basic legal rights of every man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Access to the High Court of Australia by every man, every woman and indeed every <span class="highlight">child</span>, where an action is brought on behalf of a <span class="highlight">child</span>, should be unrestricted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To that extent, in giving my support to this Bill, I urge that governments, regardless of party affiliation watch carefully to ensure that there has not been created a situation in which the highest court of the land has become a court which is inaccessible to the ordinary man, woman and <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am expressing now a personal view on the basis of cases that have come into my office involving heart-rending stories of a spouse, either male or female, where problems have arisen over the custody of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view, it is extremely difficult to get away from that feeling of involvement with both parties, particularly where the welfare of a <span class="highlight">child</span> is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be extremely difficult for the courts in their wisdom to decide matters of care and control of children, be it with the mother or the father. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite obviously, the welfare of the <span class="highlight">child</span> is the most important issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased that in most of the decisions that have been brought to my attention the judges who have been appointed to this jurisdiction have shown a great degree of objectivity in deciding what is to be done for the welfare of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where that situation arises, the damage done to the children cannot be calculated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Committee will be looking at that matter because the deleterious effects on children should be uppermost in the minds of both parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is nothing more heartrending than to see a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s life destroyed by intransigent parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We saw a <span class="highlight">child</span> minding centre in those courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not one member of that Committee was not moved by watching those children playing with grandmothers or with other people who were accepting the responsibility of parents who could not get along. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Joint Parliamentary Committee must accept the responsibility of trying to probe deep enough into this matter and of coming forward with recommendations which are not just concerned with property settlement or the custody of a <span class="highlight">child</span>- a chattel to be handed to a mother or a father. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact it would be considered highly irresponsible and unethical in the case of the hand but not so in the case of the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regarding the rights of the unborn, I think in this year, the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>, when we are celebrating the twentieth anniversary of the adoption by the United Nations of the Declaration of the Rights of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>, we should have a close look at that Declaration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">child</span>, by reason of his physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a tragedy it would be if this Parliament in the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span> ignored that declaration and voted against this motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 40-year old woman pregnant as a result of rape may seek the advice of her husband, her children and her doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not one of us men in this House can speak of the personal experience which a woman or <span class="highlight">child</span> undergoes in circumstances where she has to make a decision to terminate her pregnancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If she is a healthy, normal girl her life will not be in danger in giving birth to her father’s <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The girl, her mother or other members of the family must therefore pay the full cost of the operation to abort her father’s <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basis of the motion and the amendments is to persuade members of this House that abortion should be carried out only where the life of the woman or <span class="highlight">child</span> is in danger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until that attack she had been living happily with her husband and four teenage children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This must be noted by the four teenage children and the husband, they also knowing that the foetus which is developing in the womb of the mother is that of one of several louts who subjected their mother or wife to the denigrating violation of the individual by rape. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances I see two competing moral questions: Should the mother carry that <span class="highlight">child</span>, thereby causing unwarranted pressure on the family and perhaps even placing the family unity and wellbeing under threat, or should she have the <span class="highlight">child</span> aborted? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not wanting the <span class="highlight">child</span> is an important factor especially among the young and single. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From these cases, it must be accepted that there is a rule of law which recognises that an unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> may possess rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This implies that there are correlative duties imposed on others in favour of the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also implies that an unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> is deemed to be a ‘person’ where the right is for his benefit, so if he survives his binh and obtains the requisite capacity to institute proceedings for an infringement of his rights, he may do so and obtain a remedy for the infringement when he was en ventre sa mere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the various cases, as was pointed out, by Cozens.Hardy M. R. the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>’s rights were considered separate and distinct from the mother’s rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of lack of precedent one might be slow to apply this fiction to the law of negligence but I find no logical reason for rejecting the notion that the common law would protect a <span class="highlight">child</span> en ventre sa mere against careless acts causing him or her injury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As its property, real or personal, is protected so should its physical substance be similarly protected by deeming it to be a person in being and imposing a duty of care on any other person not to commit any act of carelessness which as a reasonable man he would anticipate would injury the physical substance of the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without being called upon to refuse to follow any authority binding on this Court, there appears to be no valid reason, in principle or otherwise, why this concept of protecting the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> should not be introduced to the developing law of the independent tort of negligence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We consider that the abovementioned judgment is authority for the proposition that the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> is recognised by law as a person separate from his/her mother and is the possessor of rights under law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recognition of the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> as a separate legal person with legal rights which are enforceable on birth must mean that the law also recognises that that legal person cannot be deprived deliberately of its life by being aborted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, not only must the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> not be damanged by careless or negligent acts, it must not be deliberately deprived of life simply because it exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We consider that it is also strongly arguable that such action in those circumstances may lack sufficient intention by a doctor to directly cause the death of the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> by such an operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The doctor’s intention in those circumstances is to preserve the life of the mother, and only indirectly to cause the death of the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legally the doctor’s intention in such a case can be characterised as a lawful attempt to preserve at least the life of the mother in the course of treating a medical pathological condition and probably the life of both the mother and the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the first group the task of raising a <span class="highlight">child</span> is onerous and lonely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The risk of a forced marriage and the fear of an unwanted <span class="highlight">child</span> is a tragic burden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the women who are disadvantaged by lack of information about contraception and lack of <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, these are often the people most vocal in opposition to sex education in schools and extended <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The restricted availability of abortions forces women to be unable to exercise the choice of avoiding a situation where an unwanted <span class="highlight">child</span> is brought into being. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Women have a variety of responsible reasons for wanting an abortion such as the inability to manage financially; inability to cope emotionally; completion of a family or a recent <span class="highlight">child</span>; no wish to be forced into a marriage; avoidance of family strife or parental awareness; ill health; worry about the deformity of a <span class="highlight">child</span>; and rape or incest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the most part women are treated unfairly in a domestic role where they are not only responsible for bearing a <span class="highlight">child</span> but also for rearing the <span class="highlight">child</span> and caring for the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, no adequate dividing line separates the <span class="highlight">child</span> from the foetus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this case, the other is the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if a woman does not want to bear a <span class="highlight">child</span>, she should not have to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise the following words-  necessary to preserve a woman from the serious danger to her life or her physical or mental health (not being merely the normal dangers of pregnancy and <span class="highlight">child</span> birth) which the continuance of the pregnancy would entail; and … in the circumstances not out of proportion to the danger to be averted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I feel that we cannot shunt off our responsibility in this manner because there is a moral aspect in the termination of pregnancy that in our opinion involves the right of an unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Parliament must ask itself: What are the facts in the biological development of a <span class="highlight">child</span>; is there life at stake in every abortion; what are the possible long term complications to the mother, the family and the nation; does an abortion terminate the life of a <span class="highlight">child</span> or is the so-called foetus just a piece of tissue? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be admitted that in planned or unplanned pregnancy followed by an abortion or even by childbirth the female pays the greater price in human involvement and in human suffering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But society cannot escape its responsibility to the unfortunate woman who does not get this assistance by simply saying: ‘You can do what you like with the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> and we’- that is society or the government- ‘will pay the medical or surgical bill’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Scientific evidence clearly indicates that once conception takes place we have the life of an unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> to consider. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the conception and life of a <span class="highlight">child</span> in a mother’s womb and its birth concern not only co-operation between man and woman to bring new life into the world but are also the very basis of Christian belief in the creator and in the sacredness of human life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Many of these women feel that society is saying to them: ‘If you cannot alford the confinement or if you do not think you can keep the <span class="highlight">child</span> after birth, we have given you a way out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Have they not a right to carry the <span class="highlight">child</span> and see the birth of the <span class="highlight">child</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Not one member of the House of Representatives knows what it feels like to be a single girl who is pregnant to a man who cannot and more often than not will not undertake the responsibility of providing food and shelter for the <span class="highlight">child</span> she is carrying for him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not one honourable member knows what it is like to be the tired and overworked mother of a poor man’s clutch of children and to be pregnant with another that will place further and unbearable burdens on her shoulders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we are endowed with an ounce of Christian charity we should not be indifferent to the anxieties that torture the mind of every woman who is pregnant with an unwanted <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same burden will plague our souls if we pass laws that result in the birth of an unwanted <span class="highlight">child</span> whose birth destroys the happiness of its mother, the happiness of its father or the happiness of its brothers and sisters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let those who oppose abortion do more than they are now doing to lift the living standards of those who constitute the majority of the working families so that married couples can at least afford to welcome every <span class="highlight">child</span> that is conceived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accepting the balance of expert opinion as to when life begins, the sanctity and the supreme importance of the individual life applies to the foetus and the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> as well as to any other group such as the aged, the incurably ill or whatever it may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also say most sincerely that I am deeply conscious of the anguish and hardship an unwanted pregnancy can sometimes cause- and I have in mind not only the mother but also the subsequent difficulties of what may turn out to be an unwanted or unloved <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>or where either (a) the pregnancy was as a result of incest or rape or (b) the mother has been subject to disease or physical conditions which could reasonably be expected to result in serious deformity to or retardation of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I believe that an unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> has a right to hie, recognising that under the law as it stands, the life of a mother is given preference over the life of an unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That an unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> has a right to life is widely recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I made the point on that occasion that the fundamental question was whether the rights of an unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> should be recognised during the whole or only part of a pregnancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason I am opposed to the payment of medical benefits for abortion is contained amongst those reasons I have already stated and it is, of course, the right to life of the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that emphasises the point I want to make and which I think has been forgotten, and that is that the provision of medical benefit payments gives a sense of security to people who may not have that sense of security and who may be prepared to avoid the possibility of becoming pregnant if they have to look after and deal with an unwanted <span class="highlight">child</span> or face the dangers of an abortion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What about adopting a positive resolution on what we can do for women in order to guarantee that they can retain a <span class="highlight">child</span> and not be subjected to the physical and mental disturbances that obviously occur? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the situation since the introduction of the supporting mother’s benefit with regard to the adoption of children one will see how we have improved the situation on the very simple basis of enabling a mother to retain her <span class="highlight">child</span>, which is a normal, strong maternal instinct and is very good for the <span class="highlight">child</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In New South Wales in 1972, 3,3 10 children were adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words the <span class="highlight">child</span> was separated from its mother by the set of circumstances then prevailing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many arguments are raised by people of goodwill against the practice of abortion itself, but it is simply not practicable to oblige women to have children they do not wish to have, and it is not realistic or fair to argue that if a woman did not want a <span class="highlight">child</span> she should not have become pregnant in the first place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of the speakers who have taken part in the debate have had one thing in common- namely, the protection of the woman and the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My personal feeling is that in protection of Mother and <span class="highlight">Child</span>, there should be a continuing responsibility by Governments in regard to family allowance, medical services, <span class="highlight">child</span> care, education and housing, etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Normally I would agree with the classic liberal proposition that the law should not intervene in matters of private morality; but I believe that the classic liberal proposition I have just stated does not apply in this matter because another life is at stake, the life of the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No discussion on abortion should ignore the status and rights of the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I do want to give some examples of how we commonly accept in our own thinking and terminology that there is a mother and a <span class="highlight">child</span> involved in an abortion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest the very use of the word ‘mother’ indicates that in the Minister’s mind an abortion involves a mother and a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There cannot be a mother without a <span class="highlight">child</span> being involved as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that in our normal thinking we do think of an abortion involving both a mother and a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that in the years 1975 to 1977 there were two deaths from abortion and 69 deaths from <span class="highlight">child</span> birth in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he agree that the habit of regular physical activity should be introduced early in a <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s school life but that many Australian schools lack specialist physical education teachers, while teachers generally and parents underestimate the significance for health and mental alertness of regular physical exercise? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did a 1970 survey show that 75 per cent of post-primary children in government schools are denied a planned continuous program of physical education because their schools are without a gymnasium? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he agree that it is imperative and urgent that a program be adopted to make physical education a daily requirement at all levels in government schools and to provide gymnasia to all schools and a physical education specialist teacher on the basis of one physical education teacher to every 200 children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As 1979 is the International Year of the <span class="highlight">Child</span>, it is a most opportune time to get children interested and involved in sporting and recreational activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Secondly, where the <span class="highlight">child</span> is known to be, or could in all probability be, deformed or mentally defective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that those placed in the unfortunate position of deciding whether or not an abortion is to be performed would, despite the stress that inevitably accompanies such occasions, make a responsible moral judgment about what is best, giving due weight to the fact of the presence of an unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> at a particular stage of development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That all words after ‘That’ (first occurring) be omitted, with a view to substituting the following words: this House expresses its deep concern that for every three live births in Australia there is one abortion, and therefore is of the opinion that the Government should take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that medical benefits shall not be provided by the Commonwealth for the termination of pregnancy unless the termination is performed to protect the mother when her life is endangered by a physical pathological condition or where either (a) the pregnancy was as a result of incest or rape, or (b) the mother has been subject to disease or physical conditions which could reasonably be expected to result in serious deformity to or retardation of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real motivation underlying the Lusher motion would appear, inevitably, to be a belief in the sanctity of human life- a belief that the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> has as much right to life as has any other human being. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate that critics of this viewpoint will argue that, whilst the very existence of life may be a matter of great principle, so too is the quality of that life and that to permit a <span class="highlight">child</span> to be born into a family or to an individual who does not want it or who feels she cannot cope is a greater misfortune than to abort the life of that <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I ask the question: Does every pregnant woman have the basic right to determine whether her unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> shall be permitted to live or to die regardless of circumstances? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should she have the basic right to say that her unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> be not permitted to live simply because she does not want the <span class="highlight">child</span> or because it may cause financial or other strain which she would prefer not to have to cope with? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the end of the day these arguments of the quality of life for both parents and children and the rights of women have to be weighed on the scales against the principle of the right of human beings to be born, provided the safety of the mother’s life is not at issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Balaclava  (Mr Macphee),  in his speech yesterday, quoted with approval an extract from the Royal Commission on Human Relationships that the life of the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> is different in quality from the life of a human being after birth, the clear implication being that the life of the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> is somehow inferior. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The evidence, at least in relation to one substantial clinic, is that the main reasons persons have gone to have abortions are as follows: Firstly, in 32 per cent of the cases it was felt that future plans might be impaired by a <span class="highlight">child</span> being born to the mother; secondly, in 35 per cent of the cases it was felt that there would be additional financial strain on the rest of the family; thirdly, in 1 7 per cent of the cases it was felt that the girl concerned was too young or too immature to deal with a <span class="highlight">child</span>; and, fourthly, that in 5 per cent of the cases the woman was pregnant to a man other than her husband. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite have taken steps to reduce the capacity of families to handle the added <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How could people living on the 12th or 15th floor of a building face the prospect of another <span class="highlight">child</span> when perhaps they already have two or three children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the question: Who will speak for the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>, other than the members of this Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think those of us who know of women or young girls who might have wanted to lose a <span class="highlight">child</span> will understand the trauma of those occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that an excessive number of abortions has the effect of depriving those young couples of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1977 the New Zealand Royal Commission on Contraception, Sterilisation and Abortion handed a report to Parliament which proposed that the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> was entitled to effective legal protection in any abortion laws laid down in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is a shame when we in Australia have families deprived of being able to have children and there are years and years of waiting to be able to adopt a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, no public law, no public directive, can shield that life from harm, but that does not mean that there is no public responsibility to assist and protect, within the means available, the mother and the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was impressed especially by the comments of the honourable member for Lyne  (Mr Lucock)  when he stressed the need for a positive approach to the abortion issue; in effect, that we should look to greater social support for the mother, and that we should give her an opportunity, by counselling, advice and economic support, to bear her <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We can only stress on occasions such as this that the life of the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> is very important and cannot be treated as something without any real value or worth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government worked a con trick on mothers by removing the breadwinner’s dependent deduction and lumping it together with the <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first part of the ruling is proportionate to the second part, but where the first part refers to the death of an unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>, nothing that has been proposed should be put on the scales opposite that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is so easy to uphold the sanctity of life when the <span class="highlight">child</span> is but a foetus and then later, so convenient to send that <span class="highlight">child</span> to war to kill fellow human beings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It simply falls flat in terms of any classic liberalism because it fails to face up to and resolve the fact that another person is involved in this question of choice- the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I readily recognise that pregnancy, birth and <span class="highlight">child</span> rearing may cause enormous difficulty and hardship for the mother, either emotionally, psychologically, socially or economically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are human problems which can be solved by human, humane means, and the destruction of one of the participants in that problem- the unborn childdoes nothing to solve the root problem and in fact is inhuman and unjust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I also take some exception to the question-begging in using the phrase ‘unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>’ that we have heard so often. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The term ‘unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>’ is an absolute contradiction in terms but it illustrates the prevailing moral and verbal confusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">child</span> is by definition born and independent, and the phrase unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>’ or even ‘pre-bora <span class="highlight">child</span>’ has as much meaning as the phrase ‘living corpse’ or post-death person’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Might I, as an alternative to that, say that that trauma could not equal the joy that is experienced when even a person such as a humble back bench member of the national Parliament can persuade someone to have a <span class="highlight">child</span> rather than an abortion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If only every pregnant girl or woman desperate for help could share from society generally the love and assistance which these girls receive from these nuns, both in their pregnancy and at the birth of their <span class="highlight">child</span>, this problem would not be in its present proportion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On this motion’s logic medical benefits should also be denied for pre-natal care and <span class="highlight">child</span> birth as pregnancy is neither a pathological condition nor a medical necessity unless the services are essential to save the life of a mother or a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The contrary argument, expressed by the honourable member for Hume  (Mr Lusher),  which I support, is that a pregnant woman in fact must consider not only her welfare but also that of the <span class="highlight">child</span> to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Each of our other three children, including twin boys, was born severely jaundiced with a probability of spasticity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the life of the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span> to be regarded as being of the same value right throughout the duration of its development and pregnancy, and does its status differ from the status it has when it becomes a born <span class="highlight">child</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is important that the general schools of thought in that report are considered because it is clear from the number of abortions that are being carried out in Australia at present that varying values are placed on the unborn <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the passport review it became clear that the problems of <span class="highlight">child</span> abduction went beyond the simple matters of passport issue, and a further interdepartmental committee was therefore established to investigate all aspects of this specific problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790327_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-42-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The facts are that the people in the community with families receiving the family benefit today are worse off in real terms than they were at the end of 1975 when they received <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment and the tax rebate for children which I introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, a family with one <span class="highlight">child</span> is $2.17 a week worse off and a family with two children is $2.06 a week worse off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It saw that the rebates for dependent children, which I had introduced, if indexed, would involve cost to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is why I am able to point out- the facts confirm it- that today the average income earner or, as the Prime Minister likes to call him in that new matey parlance he has suddenly discovered, the average bloke supporting a wife and two children is, before tax but after consideration is taken of the present family allowance compared with tax rebates for children and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment in effect at the end of 1975, $8.50 a week worse off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Committee we will be proposing amendments which will broaden the scope of proposed section 7a  (  1 ) which protects the interests of children, require a response by the Government or those so delegated to a passport application in reasonable time, reduce the severity of most of the proposed penalties, and provide a right of appeal against a decision to withhold or withdraw a passport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this section is to ensure that the unmarried minor is not issued a passport without steps having been taken to protect the rights of the <span class="highlight">child</span> and the rights of persons who have custody or guardianship of or access to the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not clear how the passports office will ensure that it is in possession of the facts in relation to custody, guardianship or access for each <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, the withholding of consent by a person having custody, guardianship or, more particularly, access may not, of course, be in the interests of the <span class="highlight">child</span>, and the Act provides that a court may order that a <span class="highlight">child</span> may leave Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our proposed section 7a (2) (c) then proceeds, however, to give the authorised passports officer discretion- a discretion parallel to that of the Court- to allow a <span class="highlight">child</span> to obtain a passport and travel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This discretion in turn, would, however, seem subject- under proposed section 7B (b)- to the right of a court to order that a <span class="highlight">child</span> may not be issued a passport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our proposed amendment relates to the fact that the Bill refers only to the issue of a passport to the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, frequently, children are included on a parent’s passport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that the Bill could be interpreted to cover this situation, but given the extent of specification in the Bill it would seem best to make explicit reference to the inclusion of children on a passport, and apply the same rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The resume of that particular example indicates the sorts of problems that are faced by parents in a separated situation who do have the legal custody of their children when that <span class="highlight">child</span> or those children are abducted by the other parent and removed from the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 22 February 1978, the honourable member for Hawker asked a question of the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  whether an interdepartmental committee had been appointed to examine and to report on the issue of passports with particular reference to <span class="highlight">child</span> abduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I believe that it is necessary to retain that requirement for the practical means of protecting not only the financial rights of a spouse or former spouse but also to guard against this situation of <span class="highlight">child</span> abduction and removal from the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That particular part of clause 8 is directed towards the problem of <span class="highlight">child</span> abductions but it will not eliminate the problem of the removal of children from Australia since it can be by-passed by dual nationals who hold two passports, by the use of false documents, by making false statements, and by making application outside Australia for a passport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the clause does tighten passport procedures in this regard and provides additional protection to people who may fear the abduction of their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand it has been suggested that children should be issued with individual passports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After studying this proposal the Government has come to the view that this would not prevent the unauthorised removal of a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Individual passports would also raise the possibility of the <span class="highlight">child</span> taking the passport and leaving the country without the knowledge of either parent or being removed by another unauthorised person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, there would be increased workloads in issuing separate passports for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed requirement for parental consent to the Issue of a passport to children who have not obtained the age of 18 years, which is embodied in the legislation, therefore provides the opportunity, so far as the legislation can practically go, to cope with this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Eighteen is the age at which, according to the Family Law Act of 1975, a <span class="highlight">child</span> ceases to be under parental control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the passport review by the interdepartmental committee, to which I referred earlier, it became clear that the problems of <span class="highlight">child</span> abduction went beyond the simple matters of passport issues and a further interdepartmental committee has therefore been established to investigate all aspects of this specific problem, including the procedures which other departments and authorities could follow to prevent <span class="highlight">child</span> abduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly I believe that Cabinet legislative or administrative changes are necessary to reduce the incidence of children being removed from Australia by one parent without the knowledge or against the wishes of the other parent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the major problems with <span class="highlight">child</span> abduction concerns children whose endorsement appears on one of the parent’s passports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ultimate solution to the problem of <span class="highlight">child</span> abduction for separated or divorced couples is to ensure that separations or divorces do not occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government, through its policies, has a responsibility to ensure that maximum support is given to the family and thus minimise the likelihood of marital breakdown with its subsequent problems, of which <span class="highlight">child</span> abduction is one manifestation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Whilst I support the Passports Amendment Bill and will press our amendments to it, the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  will acknowledge my persistent efforts to eliminate the high incidence of <span class="highlight">child</span> abduction within and from Australia, and the need for urgent legislative and administrative changes to reduce it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Much <span class="highlight">child</span> abduction in Australia can be traced to the parents having dual nationalities and acting in defiance of custodial orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where there is an application for a custodial order the Family Court judges have the power to call for passports and impound them until such time as the court determines which parent will have the custody of the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has said that this year <span class="highlight">child</span> care funding is to be increased by 1.03 per cent, but what it has not told the public at large is that in that increase it has lumped the cost of <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because in New South Wales there is a large number of private <span class="highlight">child</span> care centres and kindergarten union centres, which are not long day care centres, the children in the inner city areas of Sydney have been further disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>New South Wales is once again sadly disadvantaged because of the inadequate provision for <span class="highlight">child</span> care in the inner cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately when one looks at the level of expenditure and inflation, which the Government itself says will be at least 10 per cent in the coming 12 months, it can be seen that the amount of money being made available for children’s services in Australia has been reduced in real terms by 2.4 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some of this increase would have been offset because of the taxing of pensions and benefits and the change from a <span class="highlight">child</span> tax rebate to a family allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One remembers well the eulogies in this House by Government members about the Government transfer of the former provision of tax rebates in respect of children to increased family allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But since then the tax concession in respect of children has gone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The family allowance scheme is now very much like the scheme which was introduced in 1950 when another conservative government came to power on a promise to pay <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for the first <span class="highlight">child</span>- an appeal to greed rather than need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, that promise was honoured and in 1950 a five shilling <span class="highlight">child</span> allowance fee was paid in respect of the first <span class="highlight">child</span> to each family entitled to receive it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An amount of ten shillings was still being paid to families in respect of the second <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present family allowances are the same as they were when they replaced concessional taxation rebates for children back in 1976-77. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then they stood at $3.50 for the first <span class="highlight">child</span>, $5 for the second, $6 for the third and $6 for the fourth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So a family with three children is losing $4.70 a week because of this Government’s failure to index family allowances and a family with four children is losing $6.70 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While the number of <span class="highlight">child</span> removal cases appears not to be as high as media reports had suggested, the Government is concerned to make its legislation and administrative procedures as effective as possible to minimise the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Tonight I wish to raise three particular matters- two dealing with children- which I hope the Government will look at. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790926_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first matter I raise is the situation of a war widow who, after the death of her husband, has a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790926_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the existing law, that woman is not eligibile for payment in respect of that <span class="highlight">child</span> by way of an additional payment to her war widow’s pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790926_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If she were in receipt of a civilian widow’s pension, she would be eligible for such a payment in respect of that <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790926_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But because of the differences between the repatriation Acts, and veterans affairs and social services legislation, she is denied any payments in respect of that <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790926_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus the <span class="highlight">child</span> itself is denied any assistance from the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790926_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That woman cannot make a claim under social security legislation in respect of that <span class="highlight">child</span> because, in assessing the <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s entitlement to assistance, the amount of her war widow’s pension is counted as income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790926_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is one instance that I wish to raise in respect of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790926_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the family allowance has been frozen at the same level for three years prices have escalated by 30 per cent, spending on education has been reduced, <span class="highlight">child</span> care services have been starved of funds and housing has become dearer and dearer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable members will know, the record real spending on education in Australia is mainly bringing more and more pay for more and more teachers, and not better facilities for children at schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government spending for each <span class="highlight">child</span> in State schools has never been so high, even after inflation is taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not up to the Federal Government to dictate to the States how they should distribute their education money between buildings and equipment, and teachers salaries, but it is disgraceful when States blame the Federal Government for problems emerging from their own decisions, particularly when more Government money is being spent on each <span class="highlight">child</span> in State schools in Australia than ever before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So teachers have won their campaigns for more benefits for themselves at the expense of facilities for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Payment is made, for the whole period, to the person or approved institution having the care of the <span class="highlight">child</span> on the first day of the pay period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This can mean that a person or institution having the care of a <span class="highlight">child</span> for the greater part of a period but not the commencement, receives nothing by way of family allowance in respect of that period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Broadly stated, the conditions for payment of family allowance apply also to double orphan’s pension and handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance, but handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance is not payable to an institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently the absence of a <span class="highlight">child</span> from the family home for a few days covering the commencement of a family allowance period can result in the non payment to the parent or guardian of amounts of $47.70 and $65 a month respectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To correct this the Government proposes that, where a <span class="highlight">child</span> moves from one person to another or enters or leaves an institution, entitlement will be decided on the basis of the number of days for which a <span class="highlight">child</span> is in the care of the person or institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of a handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s allowance, the absence of a <span class="highlight">child</span> from the private home for a short period can be disregarded and payment continued uninterrupted provided family allowance continues to be payable to the parent or guardian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, under existing conditions if a <span class="highlight">child</span> enters an institution to which family allowance is payable the parent or guardian loses handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed to amend the law to enable handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s allowance to be paid to the parent or guardian where the <span class="highlight">child</span> is in an endowed institution for a temporary period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as at present, the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance will not be payable where handicapped children’s benefit or nursing home benefit is paid to an institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, in order to qualify for a double orphan’s pension a person must be caring for a <span class="highlight">child</span>, other than a <span class="highlight">child</span> he has adopted, both of whose parents are no longer living, or one of whose parents is deceased and the other is not able, because of specified circumstances, to support the <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will be aware that some people have travelled overseas to adopt children under the laws of other countries or to bring children to Australia with a view to adoption under Australian law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While there is no barrier to payment of a double orphan’s pension where a <span class="highlight">child</span>, Australian born or otherwise, is awaiting adoption in Australia, it has never been the intention to pay the double orphan’s pension for any adopted <span class="highlight">child</span>, including those adopted under the laws of another country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rate applicable for a <span class="highlight">child</span> in the care of his mother, adoptive or step-parent, will rise by $2.05 to $12.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If both parents are deceased, or the <span class="highlight">child</span> is not being maintained by a parent, adoptive parent or stepparent the rate will rise by $4.10 to $25 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The case I refer to is that of a women who, having been widowed, subsequently has a <span class="highlight">child</span> and that <span class="highlight">child</span> is treated by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs as nonexistent where the woman receives a war pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of Veterans’ Affairs takes the position that the <span class="highlight">child</span>, not being the <span class="highlight">child</span> of the husband as a result of whose war service the woman receives a war widows pension, is not the responsibility of that Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that it is the responsibility of Acts of Parliament to moralise on the conduct of people to the extent that they are fined and their children are disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation of a woman who has a <span class="highlight">child</span> not covered by a war widows pension because it is not a <span class="highlight">child</span> of the deceased exserviceman whose offspring attract a pension, is that if she applies to the Department of Social Security for coverage of that <span class="highlight">child</span>, the war widows pension is applied as a means test against her in assessing whether the childrens allowance will be paid in respect of that <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If she were receiving a social security widows pension, the <span class="highlight">child</span> would be covered automatically, but because she is receiving a war widows pension, she is denied cover for the <span class="highlight">child</span> under either form of pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In one case the Department of Veterans’ Affairs says that it is not the <span class="highlight">child</span> of the ex-serviceman and in the other case the Department of Social Security says to the woman: ‘Your widows pension is such that it excludes you, because of the means test, from getting coverage for that <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What it is really saying to that woman is that she has to give up her war widows pension and take a social security pension in order to get coverage for that <span class="highlight">child</span> because of the cross use of the means test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it was considered desirable not to add to government spending, a reduction in the Family Allowances could pay for the increased supplement paid to lower income groups, e.g., a reduction of $4 per month per <span class="highlight">child</span> would have resulted in approximately $200m in 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has increased and extended eligibility for the handicapped <span class="highlight">child</span>’s allowance, expanded the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service and widened the eligibility for acceptance for the free-of-charge programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Earlier this year the Government announced a commitment of up to $ lm to establish a <span class="highlight">Child</span> Accident Prevention Foundation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourthly, there is payment of the family allowance on a daily basis for a <span class="highlight">child</span> moving between parents and an institution or between one person and another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fifthly, there is a continuation of the payment of the handicapped allowance to parents or those usually responsible for the care of the <span class="highlight">child</span> when the <span class="highlight">child</span> is temporarily in an institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seventhly, there is clarification of the payment of the double orphan’s pension with reference to children adopted under the law of another country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amount of payment for a <span class="highlight">child</span> goes from $10 a week to $11.25, an increase of 12.5 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are increasing the weekly payment for each <span class="highlight">child</span> from $10 to $11.25. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A married employee with at least one dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> would receive flat rate weekly benefits at a rate higher than the present adult minimum wage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In New South Wales a single employee receives $96.30 a week, a spouse $22 a week and each <span class="highlight">child</span> $ 1 1 a week, which are about the same as the rates paid by the Commonwealth for a family man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the new proposals provide for $105 a week for an employee, $30 a week for a spouse and $ 10 a week for a <span class="highlight">child</span>, but these rates will be subject to a ceiling of $155 a family a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the weekly benefits of a Commonwealth employee with a spouse and three children will exceed those that would be available under the proposed Victorian rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister: Is it a fact that since combining the then existing tax rebate for dependent children and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment in 1976 into a family allowance payment, that benefit rate has remained frozen? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the family allowance payment for four children in real terms today is $6.54 a week less than the combined tax rebate and <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment for four children in 1975? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that by terminating the tax rebate for dependent children and by refusing to index the substitute family allowance he has saved $5 80m so far at the expense of Australian children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is easy enough for people who are outstandingly bright to do so but it is not easy for the average <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we say positively that those children should be encouraged to do a lot of their schooling in a language other than English they will never get a fair share of the cake that is available in Australia and which ought to be available in Australia for all who are permanent residents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When one looks at what has occurred in children’s services in New South Wales, one is quite concerned about the position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to 1973, under the former Liberal-Country Party Government in New South Wales, about 25c per <span class="highlight">child</span> per annum was being spent on children’s services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the same period in Victoria, which had a more enlightened form of liberalism in control, the State Government was spending approximately $2 per <span class="highlight">child</span> per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Whitlam Labor Government came to power in 1 972 and the present  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  was the Minister in charge of children’s services, we saw quite a change in all States except New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were considerable difficulties in getting the New South Wales Liberal Government to come to an agreement with the Commonwealth regarding the provision of funds for <span class="highlight">child</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of children enrolled in those pre-schools increased by approximately 80 per cent, from 121,000 to 218,000 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition was the Minister in charge of this area he entered into written agreements with the States to provide 75 per cent recurrent funding for <span class="highlight">child</span> care services and a sum of $60,000 towards the capital cost of <span class="highlight">child</span> care units. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the people who formed the Interim Committee for the Children’s Commission, and particularly the two Children’s Commissioners in New South Wales,  Mr Lex  Gray and Miss Trisher Kavanagh, should be congratulated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, when  Mrs Coleman,  who heads the Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care, appeared before Estimates Committee A, she said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that that is a very suitable way to be dealing with the educational facilities that we make available to young children in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hate to see the children of my State- in particular, the children of my electorate- suffer because of that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the report of Estimates Committee A we can see that there has been a move away from the funding of <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act to the funding of facilities under what is called centre-based funding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only failing of that system at present is that it costs considerably more to run these community-based <span class="highlight">child</span> care facilities and there is a need for more recurrent funding for most of those facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The teacher-student ratio in a neighbourhood centre-type <span class="highlight">child</span> care facility is higher than the ratio in a larger pre-school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care and the Government have not taken that into account in the recurrent grants that are made available for staffing and for the other costs of running these centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The funds available under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care Act are indexed- admittedly only up to awards payments made prior to 1978 but a form of indexation is built in- whereas, unfortunately, with centre-based funding there is no indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All in all, I support the activities of the Office of <span class="highlight">Child</span> Care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> I hope that the Government will endeavour next year to make a decision for the children of New South Wales and provide some extra capital assistance in order to ensure that those children have equality of opportunity with the children of Victoria and Queensland, the adjacent States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the current supporting parent’s benefit for a parent with (a) one <span class="highlight">child</span>, (b) 2 children, (c) 3 children and (d) 4 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-47-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So one can do the sum again and include in the concept of net tax the amounts paid by the Government by way of <span class="highlight">child</span> endowment or the family allowances and the additional amounts that taxpayers have to pay now to be covered for health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1975-76, 13.3 per cent of the income of a married taxpayer with a dependent spouse and two children went in net tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The introduction of the <span class="highlight">child</span> rebate at the time was also a very worthwhile measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it was Mungo Maccallum who wrote somewhere that politicians in Australia occupied a place in public esteem somewhere between drug pushers and <span class="highlight">child</span> molesters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first of two key modifications now proposed is that the new system for taxing income of dependent children will not apply to student children aged  18  to  25  years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be limited to children who, at the end of the income year, are under the age of  1 8  years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While there is a case for proceeding on the basis that a full time student over the age of  1 8  years is a dependent <span class="highlight">child</span>, like a person under that age, we have come to the conclusion that, in the light of other modifications to the system that I will mention shortly, the case for keeping students over  18  within the system is not sufficiently strong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  $1,040  per annum level is already the threshold for a number of trusts, namely those for children under  16  covered by section  98  of the Income Assessment Tax Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, if the total taxable income of a <span class="highlight">child</span> with nonemployment income of  $1,040  per annum or less does not exceed  $3,893-  the amount up to which the zero rate of tax applies- no tax will be payable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore proposed that as well as excluding income a dependent <span class="highlight">child</span> derives as a beneficiary of a deceased estate, there will also be excluded any income that a <span class="highlight">child</span> derives in consequence of being left property by a deceased person, for example, dividends from shares bequeathed to the <span class="highlight">child</span> and income arising from the investment of a cash legacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In similar vein, income from the investment of other sums coming directly to a <span class="highlight">child</span> on a person’s death, such as the proceeds of a life insurance policy or a lump sum from a superannuation fund payable to the <span class="highlight">child</span>, will also be excluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may sometimes happen that a parent dies without having made adequate provision for his or her children- property is left to the surviving parent who then finds it necessary to settle part of it on the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Income coming to a <span class="highlight">child</span> in this indirect way on the death of a person will also be excluded from the new system, but only if the trust or other arrangement for the <span class="highlight">child</span> is made within  3  years after the death. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will also be a condition that, in total, the excluded income as a result of the death does not exceed that which would have flowed if the <span class="highlight">child</span> had received the benefit under the rules of intestacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has all along been made clear that, to the extent they are reasonable in amount, salary and wages and other income from services rendered are to be outside the new system applicable to income of dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, it is possible that a <span class="highlight">child</span> may carry on a small business, and the legislation will make it clear that income from the business is also to be excluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, income from the investment of savings out of a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s income from his or her own efforts, whether in the form of salary or wages for employment, payments for personal services, or profits from the conduct by the <span class="highlight">child</span> of a business, is to be excluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also to be excluded is income from the investment of savings out of any other income of the <span class="highlight">child</span> that is itself income of a type that is excluded; for example, savings out of income from deceased estates, from legacies, or from the investment of compensation moneys. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also in the excluded categories will be income from the investment of verifiable winnings by a <span class="highlight">child</span> from legally authorised lotteries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These will aim to ensure that, for example, in the case of income from a business, it is really the <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s own business and that the profits of the business have not been inflated by the diversion of income to it by a relative or other person not at arm’s length. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The relieving power will ordinarily not be available unless the persons concerned establish that the tax payable on the non-employment’ income of a <span class="highlight">child</span> under the new system is greater than the tax that would have been payable on that income if it had been added to the income of the <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s parent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">child</span> has minor brothers and sisters also in receipt of ‘nonemployment’ income, the ‘non-employment’ income of all of them will be added to that of the relevant parent for the purposes of this comparison. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, $5,020 is not a bad amount for a <span class="highlight">child</span> to have invested, and we are talking about children’s investments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Treasurer said, $416 was reasonable because we were looking at an investment by a <span class="highlight">child</span> of some $5,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many children in this country have investments in their names of $13,000? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are probably quite a few thousand, but it is a tremendously small proportion of the total number of children in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have tackled even that as being a modest investment for a <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, to describe $13,000 in the name of a <span class="highlight">child</span> as a modest investment shows a very strange set of values by the standards of most Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Here we are talking about children having $13,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What sort of people describe a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s investment of $13,000 as a modest investment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be continued scope for tax avoidance by income splitting with a dependent full time student <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If student children are exempted in this way, quite obviously parents can utilise a full time student <span class="highlight">child</span> for income- splitting purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New South Wales, the richest State in Australia, on its own proposition, gives $16.40 to each <span class="highlight">child</span> in a non-government primary school for every $100 it gives to each <span class="highlight">child</span> at a government school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 20 per cent odd of children who attend non-government schools in Australia cannot get a fair deal unless the States join with the Commonwealth in acknowledging some responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of that recommendation it is very wrongly and unjustly accused that it allocates somewhat more per <span class="highlight">child</span> attending a non-government school than it allocates per <span class="highlight">child</span> attending a government school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every member of this House knows that is the minority of funds which goes to support children in education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me read out the contributions by the States per <span class="highlight">child</span> attending a non-government secondary school compared with a <span class="highlight">child</span> attending a government secondary school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the State which makes the lowest allocation in Australia, Tasmania, the allocation is $16.30 per <span class="highlight">child</span> in one category compared with $100 in the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In New South Wales the allocation is $17.50 for a <span class="highlight">child</span> in one category compared with $100 for a <span class="highlight">child</span> in the other category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make the following points, which deserve to be made: I request that when the Commonwealth Government makes its funds available for non-government schools and those schools send their accounts out to parents- whether it is Blackheath College or Cunumulla Convent or whatever it happens to be- there be an obligation on those schools to make clear what is the Commonwealth’s contribution per <span class="highlight">child</span> and what is the State’s contribution per <span class="highlight">child</span> so that at least the community will begin to understand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are going to spend $800 less, by way of public expenditure and capital expenditure, on a <span class="highlight">child</span> in one sort of school compared with another sort, we want to know how much of that $800 can be made up by families- and by poor families with numbers of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No doubt it was the legacy of its birth, spawned as it was by a Labor administration, the brain <span class="highlight">child</span> of the revered Chifley Government, that led to this desire to dismantle it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The allegation is that the attention was denied because the <span class="highlight">child</span> was suffering from Down’s syndrome and that she was told during the course of an interview with the medical director of the Princess Margaret Hospital that it was best that the boy had been given no treatment, and that he was a problem and a charge on the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The short synopsis is that a coroner’s inquiry was held into the death at the Princess Margaret Hospital, Perth, of a Down’s syndrome <span class="highlight">child</span> who was admitted suffering from respiratory trouble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dr Godfrey, who is the director of the Princess Margaret Hospital, had to admit that there was no evidence of any firm diagnosis of epilepsy in this <span class="highlight">child</span>, although on his Princess Margaret Hospital record card he was described as having epileptic fits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am trying to speak for this <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The <span class="highlight">child</span> was 23 months old. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the case of a war widow who now has an illegitimate <span class="highlight">child</span>, and I raise the question of the rights of the <span class="highlight">child</span> and the rights of the woman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In correspondence with the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle),  the only information I am able to obtain is that in order to receive coverage for the <span class="highlight">child</span> under any form of benefit other than family allowances the woman would have to resign her war widow’s pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be that the expectation of a person receiving a war widow’s pension is that that pension will cover the children and the dependants of the ex-servicemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I do dispute that the war widow’s pension should then be used to deny the woman social security cover for the same <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is a simple matter of natural justice that the <span class="highlight">child</span> and the mother should be entitled to the same rights as a civilian widow with a <span class="highlight">child</span> on a social security pension, without having to accept the penalty that she must surrender her entitlements as a war widow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that the Repatriation Act is deficient, and it is certainly a fact that it is not long ago that the same <span class="highlight">child</span> would have been denied rights under the Social Services Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But those Acts have been changed to recognise the facts of life, to recognise that a moral judgment should not deny cover for a <span class="highlight">child</span> or a parent in circumstances where the <span class="highlight">child</span> exists, irrespective of the nature of its birth or its legitimacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister to give consideration to the answer that he gave to me in correspondence and to review the existing law, which provides that unless the widow resigns her war widow’s pension she can obtain no cover for the dependant <span class="highlight">child</span> simply because of the interaction of that pension and the Social Services Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She is entitled to the war widow’s pension because she is a war widow, and she should not be asked to surrender that pension in order to gain coverage for her <span class="highlight">child</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She is denied cover for the <span class="highlight">child</span> unless she resigns that pension, and that is a penalty based on a moral judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>If the Repatriation Act is not to be permitted to cover such a <span class="highlight">child</span>, I ask the Minister to ensure that arrangements are made so that the <span class="highlight">child</span> is entitled to be considered for a social security pension in the normal way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Child</span> and Adult Migrant Education Programs- From 1970-71 until 1973-74 both the <span class="highlight">Child</span> and Adult Migrant Education Programs were administered by the former Department of Immigration with the Department of Education (Education and Science until the end of 1972) providing consultative advisory and servicing functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-73-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Full responsibility both for the <span class="highlight">Child</span> and Adult Migrant Education Programs was transferred to the Department of Education from the Department of Immigration on 12 June 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-73-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 1 January 1976 the responsibility under the <span class="highlight">Child</span> Migrant Education Program for the provision of funds for specialist teachers and in-service training was passed to the Schools Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-73-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Department of Education continued to exercise responsibility for overall policy, the demountable classroom program, the contingency program for refugee children, emergency classroom accommodation for refugee children, teaching and learning materials and assistance in teacher education <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-73-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister received any reports of the coroner’s inquiry into the death of the <span class="highlight">child</span> Christopher Derkacz at the Princess Margaret Hospital in Perth about which I inquired last week? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister seen Press reports of evidence of the paediatric registrar of the Princess Margaret Hospital, a  Dr Clothier,  who, referring to some Down’s syndrome children and their condition, said ‘and so the <span class="highlight">child</span> is allowed to pass away’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister seen Press reports that  Dr Fry,  the Medical Director at the Princess Margaret Hospital, has been proclaiming to all parents of handicapped children that the full facilities of the hospital have been and always are available to handicapped children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thus, income from deceased estates, or from property left to the <span class="highlight">child</span> by a deceased person will be outside the new system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So too will income from the investment of other sums coming directly to a <span class="highlight">child</span> on a person ‘s death, such as the proceeds of a life insurance policy or a lump sum from a superannuation fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Income from property transferred to a <span class="highlight">child</span> by another person to whom the property was left by a deceased person, if transferred within three years after the death of that person, will be excluded if within limits set by relevant rules of intestacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">child</span> in full time employment will, of course, be outside the new system altogether but, as regards a <span class="highlight">child</span> not categorically excluded in this way, employment income from part time work and income from a business conducted by the <span class="highlight">child</span> alone or with another minor will both be outside the new system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Income from court-ordered settlements arising as a result of divorce or judicial separation, income from the investment of a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s lottery winnings and income from the investment of savings out of any of the excluded categories of income make up the balance of the classes of income excluded from the new system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These safeguarding measures aim to ensure, for example, that profits are not diverted to a <span class="highlight">child</span> ‘s business by relatives or other persons not at arm’s length, and that income from a <span class="highlight">child</span>’s investment is not inflated by similar diversions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Trust income to which a <span class="highlight">child</span> under 18 years of age is, or is deemed to be, presently entitled is already taxable in the trustee’s hands and will be taxed under the new system on the same basis as would apply if the <span class="highlight">child</span> derived the income directly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is to the effect that a <span class="highlight">child</span>, or the trustee for a <span class="highlight">child</span>, will be eligible for a rebate to the extent that the tax otherwise payable on the relevant eligible income is greater than the tax that would have been payable on that income if it had been derived by the parent, or the parent with the higher taxable income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">child</span> has minor brothers or sisters also in receipt of eligible income, the eligible incomes of all of them will be added to that of the relevant parent in ascertaining how much tax the income would have borne in the parent’s hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I also draw the honourable member’s attention to the Minister’s report ‘<span class="highlight">Child</span> Migrant Education 1 978-79 ‘ which I tabled in the Senate on15 November 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-84">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also suggest to the honourable member for Sturt that if he reads clause 14- stronger, as it is, than the old section 43- together with clause 12 of the present Bill, which refers to a <span class="highlight">child</span> of a marriage who is under 18 years of age, he will see that the Bill enables the court, of its own motion or at the request of either party, to order that the parents attend a conference with a welfare officer to discuss the welfare of their <span class="highlight">child</span> and try to resolve any differences between them concerning the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, there is also the provision which has been written into this Bill and which has found a place in the existing law, that is, that the court shall not pronounce a decree nisi unless it is satisfied that proper, reasonable, satisfactory arrangements have been made for the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
