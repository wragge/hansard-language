<ul>
  <li>
    <p>As a means of meeting one of the problems of retention of skilled Service personnel, will the Minister earnestly consider initiating a scheme in the 3 Services whereby postings of serving members with <span class="highlight">families</span>, with a consequent disruption to family life, will be made only when other persons with similar skills and qualifications and willing and able to accept the postings are not available? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government considered any provision for the future employment of farmers and their <span class="highlight">families</span> who, under Government plans for reorganisation of primary industry, may be removed from the land? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister-in-Charge of Tourist Activities, refers to the failure of some briefly constituted travel agencies, one recently in South Australia, resulting from which booked passengers, including migrants, have now lost savings or money which they had secured on [oan to visit <span class="highlight">families</span> overseas, without much chance of recovering the fare money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710407_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does the Acting Minister for Immigration reconcile the rejection of an assisted passage to  Mr Nigel  Joseph and his family with the reiteration by  Dr Forbes  of an immigration policy that places heavy emphasis on the reuniting of <span class="highlight">families</span> through normal immigration processes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of statements suggesting that the Government favours more creches and child minding centres, will the Government consider financing home help facilities to assist mothers who for health or other good reasons need help with young <span class="highlight">families</span> so that the children can be kept in the home? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consideration is being given to closing the Takone and Calder West non-official post offices when the automatic telephone service is introduced shortly, and the Dulverton office at the end of April as it is serving only 2 <span class="highlight">families</span>, one being that of the Postmistress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We read frequently of  almost entire <span class="highlight">families</span> being wiped out by accidents on the road or in the air, or some other misadventure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ministers have to spend a considerable time in Canberra whether Parliament is sitting or not and it is in the interests of the Government, of the administration, and of the country that they should be encouraged to live in Canberra and be assisted by having suitable accommodation available to them, lt is also reasonable in these circumstances that Ministers should be able to bring their <span class="highlight">families</span> to Canberra and establish their homes here, at least temporarily, if they wish to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And that this is an unfair imposition on the human rights of all people who wish to plan their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the announcement of last July of the 25 per cent across the board tariff cuts and to the Prime Minister’s more recent statement that that decision embodied a Government aim of lower prices for Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many floors are planned for any buildings and how many persons or <span class="highlight">families</span> are expected to be accommodated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-45-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) What facilities exist in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory for management of <span class="highlight">families</span> with a battered child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-101-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To compensate for the losses that will follow from the proposed reduction and to help meet escalating educational costs faced by all <span class="highlight">families</span> your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should take immediate steps to restore educational benefits to parents, at least at the 1973-74 level either by increasing taxation deductions or through taxation rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the National Compensation Bill 1974 and the proposals Tor a new superannuation scheme for Australian Government employees discriminate in the payment of reversionary benefits against the members of <span class="highlight">families</span> which: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the National Compensation Bill 1974 and the new superannuation scheme for Australian Government employees be amended to provide for the payment of reversionary benefits to dependent members of all <span class="highlight">families</span>, however constituted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister further aware that the guidelines will divide immediate <span class="highlight">families</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the division of <span class="highlight">families</span> by wilful act of the Commonwealth Government will not only cause terrible anguish to all concerned but could threaten the very lives of those forced to remain in South Vietnam, will the Government immediately review its guideline policies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That reduction of the age limit from six years to eighteen months for patients eligible to receive cows’ milk substitutes as a Pharmaceutical Benefit under the schedules of the National Health Act will cause serious financial hardship to many <span class="highlight">families</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister request the Postal Commission to reintroduce the opening of post offices on Saturday mornings so long as it is justified on a cost benefit basis for the convenience of the public generally and particularly for <span class="highlight">families</span> where both parents work and for reasons of stimulating an increase in business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Really I am talking about <span class="highlight">families</span> now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) What is the number of motherless <span class="highlight">families</span> living in Australia and, in particular, <span class="highlight">families</span> with children under 16 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect to such motherless <span class="highlight">families</span>, how many parents have (a) sought and (b) received a special benefit under the Social Services Act during the last two years in respect to assistance in the maintenance of their children, specifying the numbers in each State where such benefits have been obtained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the undertaking given by  Senator Withers  to obtain a comparison of the costs of Prime Ministers I ask him whether he would also obtain a comparison of the costs of all Ministers and their <span class="highlight">families</span> who travel with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 ) (a) and (b) The Fairbridge Society sponsors ‘two parent’ and ‘one parent’ <span class="highlight">families</span> with children for admission to their institutions in Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was found that two Timorese <span class="highlight">families</span> occupied each of the two houses and the rents charged amounted to $60 and $80 per week respectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further investigations are proceeding to locate other Timorese <span class="highlight">families</span> and to check the rentals they are being charged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-17">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a policy which has conferred significant benefit and help on about 360 000 <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I extend to you,  Mr President,  to  Mrs Laucke,  to all senators and their <span class="highlight">families</span>, all the best wishes for Christmas and the New Year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the May school holiday season is rapidly approaching and as the stated policy of this Government is to assist those in greatest need, can the Minister inform the chamber what percentage of children of working parents who took advantage of the Christmas holiday children’s care program were children of one parent <span class="highlight">families</span> or lower income <span class="highlight">families</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Look into the situation of hardship caused by the cost to pensioners and their <span class="highlight">families</span> who have to meet the difference between fees charged by some nursing homes and the pensions and subsidies available to offset these. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to congressional critics of the plan, the 620,000- kilowatt reactor is being built close to an active volcano, close to a potential hot mud flow, possibly near a fault line and close to the Subic Bay naval base where more than 3,000 American <span class="highlight">families</span> live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister explain the apparent contradiction whereby shopkeepers who lost trade as a direct result of the security arrangements for the Conference will be paid full indemnity while three <span class="highlight">families</span> who lost providers will not be compensated for the loss of future income nor for the emotional stress caused by the violent deaths of the men concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the Commonwealth is setting up a trust fund for the education and general benefit of the three children of the Council workers killed in the explosion as an indication of the Government’s concern for their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1977 some 70 children from migrant <span class="highlight">families</span> were given priority places. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, we feel very strongly that we do not want any interference from the Government in the payment to <span class="highlight">families</span> of the family allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As there is much confusion amongst the young unemployed and their <span class="highlight">families</span> after  Mr Viner’s  barely concealed threats to take away their unemployment benefit, will the Minister for Education explain his reference in the telex to ‘a process of early identification of “at risk” students, devising meaningful alternatives for them’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are very conscious that a significant number of people, in their <span class="highlight">families</span> or in their schools, have lost some degree of self-esteem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure the promise which was made then and the action which has been foreshadowed in  His  Excellency’s Speech will provide a great deal of encouragement to a section of the community which is in need of encouragement, that is, young men with <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There ought to be measures to encourage a man with a wife and children, particularly those who have large <span class="highlight">families</span>, because in the present circumstances these <span class="highlight">families</span> have a very tough job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will facilitate family reunion as, in the past, for financial reasons, some Yugoslavs preceded their <span class="highlight">families</span> here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will avoid the social consequences of separated <span class="highlight">families</span> in future migration and, by easing the financial strain of migration, will strengthen and speed successful settlement in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So, as I see the tasks of the Government, they are to set the general social and economic conditions which will make possible the building of sufficient good quality homes to satisfy the needs of most <span class="highlight">families</span> and, as the report of the Housing Industry Association Committee very rightly said, I believe, to provide housing for the lower income earners and the underprivileged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only the <span class="highlight">families</span> who were assisted to purchase the 304,000 homes at favorable interest rates have gained advantage out of this scheme; the nation itself has been tremendously enriched by the fact that this has been a sensible scheme to assist the serviceman to become a home owner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>lt is true that the States brought their problems to the Commonwealth, but their indebtedness to the Commonwealth, because of a system, to which the States had agreed, of allowing the Commonwealth to collect all the income tax, because of the tremendous growth of income that came about with our development and our improved prosperity for the <span class="highlight">families</span> which were already here and the new <span class="highlight">families</span> which were being added from day to day, meant that the returns to the States were inadequate to meet the demands for expenditure on education and hospitals and all the other expenditures that the States were required to meet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>[10.1] -  Senator McClelland  has referred to section 82q of the principal Act and and has told us how it relates specifically to the manner of assessing the eligibility of low income <span class="highlight">families</span> for assistance with the costs of health insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-57-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paragraph (e) to which the honourable senator has referred provides that certain forms of income are not to be excluded when calculating means as assessed of low income <span class="highlight">families</span> for the purpose of assistance with the costs, of health insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-57-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The assistance with health insurance for low income <span class="highlight">families</span> is directed to those groups in the community which are not otherwise assisted by way of pensions or allowances under the Social Services Act, the Repatriation Act or the Tuberculosis Act and by virtue of the payment of those pensions or allowances are usually eligible for medical, hospital and pharmaceutical care under the pensioner medical service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-57-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In assessing the eligibility of low income <span class="highlight">families</span> for assistance it is necessary to place the applicants on the same relative basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-57-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the income falling within the categories I have mentioned was excluded when assessing eligibility, then it would place the recipients of the income in an advantageous position as compared to other <span class="highlight">families</span> and this would give rise to anomalies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-57-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As 1 have said, doctors are not bound to charge the most common fee and in the case of unemployment and sickness beneficiaries and low income <span class="highlight">families</span> it is most likely that most of them will relate their fees to the benefit rather than the most common fee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-57-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>(24), (25) and (26) proposed by the Opposition, which relate to low income <span class="highlight">families</span> whose benefits are subsidised in full, or to the extent of two-thirds or one-third. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-57-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that the proposed amendment is directed to section 82s which relates to unemployment and sickness beneficiaries and no similar amendment is proposed with respect to section 82t which relates to low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-57-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides that the Minister may determine an approved scale of benefits which will be paid to unemployment and sickness beneficiaries and low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-57-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Health  (Dr Forbes)  in his statement of 4th March pointed out that the Government had already introduced a scheme for the provision of assistance to <span class="highlight">families</span> on low incomes in obtaining health insurance cover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It therefore follows that assistance to insure must be provided for these low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator McClelland  referred to low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular I refer to those portions concerning the subsidised medical service scheme which was introduced with the purpose of helping low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill now proposes to divide low income <span class="highlight">families</span> into 3 categories: Class A, with income up to $42.50 weekly; Class B, with income over $42.50 weekly but not exceeding $45.50; Class C, with income over $45.50 but not exceeding $48.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The two points I want to make briefly,  Senator, arc  that very few <span class="highlight">families</span> in my experience whose income is under $48.50 weekly will pay the requisite contribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My final comment is to ask: If the Government is sincere in its desire to help low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, could not the means test for Class A be set at $48.50 weekly and this proposal for Classes B and C abolished? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This could provide a real benefit for <span class="highlight">families</span> who must by our present day standards be regarded as ‘the poor’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, doctors are not bound to charge the most common fee and in the case of unemployment and sickness beneficiaries and low income <span class="highlight">families</span> it is most likely that most of them will relate their fees to the benefit rather than the most common fee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that the same consideration would apply to amendments 24, 25 and 26 which all relate to the low income <span class="highlight">families</span> whose benefits are subsidised to the full or to the extent of two-thirds or one-third. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their greatest charge most definitely is the every day risk of cover for themselves and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the inquiry of the Senate select committee we found that by far the greatest burden on all <span class="highlight">families</span> was the cost of recurring general practitioner services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the first time that the Government has subsidised the insuring of low income <span class="highlight">families</span> as it has done in this plan under which benefits are subsidised in full, or to the extent of twothirds, or to the extent of one-third. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator McManus  has suggested that the Government should delete the 3 sections and that all low income <span class="highlight">families</span> should be subsidised in full. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think honourable senators have lo appreciate that the Government is, for the first lime, assisting these low income <span class="highlight">families</span> in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During my second reading speech I made the point, which 1 think is important, that it is estimated that some 84.000 <span class="highlight">families</span> and 271,000 persons will be eligible for assistance because of the extension of the assistance, and that the additional cost in a full year will be S3m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our proposals are designed to ameliorate the problems of men with low incomes, particularly those with large <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators examine what happened with their <span class="highlight">families</span> they will find that in most cases general practitioners delivered their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ask the Minister whether he knows that  Dr Colin  Clark recently advocated a type of reverse taxation so that <span class="highlight">families</span> who are found to be living on what may be considered to be a poverty level of income can be lifted by financial contributions from the public purse to a level of income which will allow them a reasonable living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We of course feel the greatest sympathy for deserted wives who not only have problems which they face in bringing up their <span class="highlight">families</span> but have other obvious difficulties as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Act at present provides for low income <span class="highlight">families</span> to be assisted with the costs of contributing for medical and hospital benefits and, as honourable senators are aware, the National Health Bill proposes extensions to this assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bases of assessing eligibility are weekly income for <span class="highlight">families</span> below pensionable age and ‘means as assessed’ for <span class="highlight">families</span> of pensionable age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The National Health Act, however, provides for these forms of income to be included when calculating the ‘means as assessed’ for low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment would have the effect of providing that, for <span class="highlight">families</span> over pensionable age, eligibility would be based on means as assessed identical with that applied under the Social Services Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Families</span> with means as assessed under the Social Services Act equivalent to$47 or less a week are eligible for age pensions, plus enrolment in the pensioner medical service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Families</span> with means as assessed under the Social Services Act equivalent to between  $47  and$70 per week are eligible for what we have come to term taper pensions, but are not eligible for enrolment in the pensioner medical service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To assist honourable senators appreciate this point, I have circulated a table setting out comparisons between  3  typical <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the income falling within the categories I have listed above were excluded when assessing eligibility, then it would place the recipient of the income in an advantageous position as compared with other <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the amendment would involve only a small increase in the cost of providing assistance to low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, the Government rejects the amendment on the ground that it would introduce a number of anomalies as between <span class="highlight">families</span> in similar financial circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The tremendous problem is the recurring expenditure, how to pay the specialised staff - the physiotherapist, the speech therapist, the occupational therapist, the psychologist and the nursing staff at these homes and the staff who visit <span class="highlight">families</span> who have children in need of care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the housing of children these days I am certain that unless there is a love content present among people who are likely to run the organisation the problems that arise for these children in their later life are made even greater by the fact that, because of their affliction, they must be away from their <span class="highlight">families</span>, lt brings one to realise that the assistance that may flow in future years from this particular measure is not only assistance for the children but, indeed, for a child being born with some affliction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is virtually a national disaster, with many of these people - not only those whose <span class="highlight">families</span> have been on the land for generations but those who have taken to the land a means of livelihood - finding through a combination of seasonal conditions and economic conditions that they are deprived of any hope for the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have also mentioned the measures in the health area, particularly the hospital, medical and pharmaceutical benefits and the subsidised medical services scheme which was introduced by this Government and which has done so much to alleviate health problems encountered by the aged, the sick and the infirm as well as the low income earners with young <span class="highlight">families</span> - the people who are least able to cope with these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Tn the days of a Labor Government when the standards for these things were set, the standards which the Government has failed to maintain over the intervening years, it was looked upon as a form of compensation for injuries suffered, lt was looked upon as some sort of return to both the men and their <span class="highlight">families</span> for the time that they had devoted, in most cases, during the early years of their lifetime to the service of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government should also consider providing regular leave not at 12 monthly intervals but at 6 monthly intervals, and also giving financial assistance to these people to enable them to take their <span class="highlight">families</span> a long way from where they are normally stationed so that they can see something of civilisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701014_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one goes to Melbourne today one will see the whole of the centre of the city encircled by blocks of flats up to 20 storeys high, in which <span class="highlight">families</span> are to live, in which the facilities are poor, in which the recreation facilities are almost nonexistent in relation to the numbers of people who live in the flats and in which assistance to young mothers in the form of creches and facilities for looking after their children at pre-school centres are almost non-existent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet in one case the Victoria Housing Commission is proposing to destroy 170 homes and to build in their place 4 blocks of flats, each of which will house 200 <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proof of that is the 20-storey high rise units that are now being built in that area to house <span class="highlight">families</span> and people with young children who are not able to live in a normal suburban home and enjoy the kind of life that we believe everybody should enjoy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As this was their only source of cash income for the <span class="highlight">families</span>, the persons concerned were left to fend as best they were able, off the charity of the rest of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that a housing programme is being undertaken, but if one looks al the reserve at Burketown, where there are only 4 or 5 Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span>, one sees that these people live in shanties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The recent exposition of immorality and drinking on Palm Island is probably true, but is it not more important that we ensure the chance of life for babies on this reserve, and every other reserve in Queensland, and justice for the adults who, by bureaucratic processes, are refused permission even to visit wives, <span class="highlight">families</span> and other relatives, sometimes for a period of years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would have been a dreadful thing for our immigration programme if we had rejected many of the fine <span class="highlight">families</span> which have come here and which are now successfully integrated because perhaps the mother - in most cases it would be the mother - did not have a knowledge of the English language when she came here and did not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, child endowment has become virtually a worthless contribution towards the assistance, succour and welfare of <span class="highlight">families</span> of this nature, but nothing has been done about the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely we should be encouraging large <span class="highlight">families</span>, not merely because they will provide men and women in this community but also because of the very grave social and economic consequences if we do not do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If <span class="highlight">families</span> are living in conditions of want, the physical and dietary deprivation of the children concerned is not the only matter involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are depriving ourselves of this opportunity by keeping in want and need the <span class="highlight">families</span> from which so many such young technicians can come, and the social and economic consequences of that can be very serious. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We point out to the Government that a great number of <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia comprise the 8.5 per cent, if that is the national average, which is living in poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are 333,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> which have 3 or more children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the 8.5 per cent is applied to the 333,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> it will be seen that probably 30,000 Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> of 3 or more children are living in poverty or are below the poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It must be emphasised that that figure was chosen arbitrarily and that no actual assessment was made as to the needs of individuals and <span class="highlight">families</span> of different composition or size. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the book People in Poverty’ - actually it was his report - he wrote that the obvious remedy for poverty in large <span class="highlight">families</span> is an increase in child endowment rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now one finds that a very real benefit is provided for <span class="highlight">families</span> or for the mother of a large family in terms of the remuneration received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They can therefore better provide for their <span class="highlight">families</span> than could parents raising children in the latter part of the 1930s and the early war years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think the approach of the Australian Democratic Labor Party would certainly have been fairer had it referred to the various ways in which assistance is rendered to <span class="highlight">families</span> by the Government, instead of being based on the assumption that the Government has culpably neglected child endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through the national health scheme <span class="highlight">families</span> have a very real ability to insure so that they will be able to offset medical and hospital expenses, a safeguard that was not available when child endowment was introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I stand by each of the recommendations we have made in the belief that, if put into law, they will help to provide, without amendment for many years, the means by which those who are in the ACT on Sundays may lead useful, happy, and if they desire, leisurely lives amongst their <span class="highlight">families</span> and their friends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From time to time we talk here about the problems confronting young people in providing themselves with a home - in the case of new arrivals, of establishing themselves in this country - and of providing a decent future for themselves and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710427_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no reason at all for people to make offensive telephone calls to the wives and members of <span class="highlight">families</span> of the diplomatic community, as has happened in this Canberra community in the last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We as politicians and members of political parties have not the right to disrupt the lives of <span class="highlight">families</span> throughout the whole community by using blaring loudspeakers so that people would have to hear whether they wanted to hear or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>And perhaps worse than all other changes, homes, the sacred retreat to which <span class="highlight">families</span> repair for their privacy and their daily way of living, would have to have their doors thrown open to all who desired to convert the occupants to new views, new morals, and a new way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I conmend the report to honourable senators and members and I hope that the Government will endorse its recommendations, for I feel sure many thousands of men, women and children who are handicapped in so many ways - ‘I have in mind, too, <span class="highlight">families</span> who have the major responsibility of caring for their loved ones who are handicapped - will gain great assistance when the recommendations in the report are acted upon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At that time, on behalf of the Opposition, I moved an amendment in these terms to the motion to take note of the Budget papers: and the Senate is of the opinion that the Budget is inadequate in that - (a) it increases taxation and health and housing costs for <span class="highlight">families</span>; (b) it makes no considered and comprehensive approach to the needs of all schools; (c) it ignores the problems of capital cities and regional centres; (d) it defers further development projects and urgent rural measures; and (e) it neglects industries based on Australian natural resources and defence requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This figure is based on the fact that 14,900 <span class="highlight">families</span> are waiting for all types of units and it allows for 3 persons to a family, which is low when we consider .the conditions of eligibility to secure a rental home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is moving into high density flat construction in the city area, which I believe is not the type of accommodation that lends itself to the proper bringing up of <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Sir MAGNUS CORMACK (Victoria) (10.12)  -  I had hoped that I would not be expected to speak on this Bill tonight because I am involved in my lifetime of experience on the frontiers of Australia in the early days of my life when the frontiers were being pushed back and when <span class="highlight">families</span> cleared the land, lived in primitive conditions and, after spending a lifetime on it, some of them made good, and some of them failed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So many <span class="highlight">families</span> are coming to the cities to swell the numbers there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the whole scheme has to be reviewed completely to ensure that not only those who are staying in the industry but also those who are being forced out of it, because of economic circumstances or because of the Government’s policy, should receive assistance to enable them to readjust themselves and their <span class="highlight">families</span> towards assisting in making this nation a better place for all to live in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Iri most instances a family cannot afford to buy cigarettes, beer and those goods that are heavily taxed by excise duty.- But these <span class="highlight">families</span> still get the whip of the sales tax on exercise books, pencils 1 and other materials needed to send their children to school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there is to be, an adherence to the dictates of union executives in the way that  Mr Hawke  claims he can require the dictates of his organisation to be observed, some people will, in the pursuit of an objective, be denying themselves the employment which they regard as vital for their own and their <span class="highlight">families</span>’ welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister, as a matter ot urgency, review the tragic and critical financial plight of the elderly and sick persons throughout Australia who occupy beds in private nursing homes at fees in many cases $50 to $100 above the benefits paid by the Government, and will he also review the Situation of their relatives who, in many instances, have to deprive themselves and their <span class="highlight">families</span> of basic necessities in order to maintain aged parents in relative decency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would have thought the fact that the Government has discharged a measure of responsibility to the pensioners and to people with <span class="highlight">families</span> consistent with its obligations to the overall economy is the surest indication that the people of Australia will be saved the prospect of a Labor government in years hereafter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Squeezed between contracting world markets and rising domestic costs, thousands of rural <span class="highlight">families</span> have been forced through crippling debts and falling incomes into leaving the land and migrating to the capital cities, thus adding to the congestion in the metropolises, where the municipal authorities are burdened with the financial obligation to provide transport, roads and footpaths, water reticulation, guttering, electricity and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Just as it has been revealed that the pension increase was not a full pension increase but a very partial one - that fact was concealed by the Government for quite a long time until finally the cat was let out of the bag - the proposed increases in child endowment are not quite as good as they sounded on Budget night because only 31.9 per cent of <span class="highlight">families</span> will receive increased benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Two persons each pay to a fund the same amount of money for the same protection for their <span class="highlight">families</span>, but in the result a wealthy person pays after his taxation deduction only $50 a year and another person will pay, after allowing for the taxation deduction, S90 a year for the same protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The increase in child endowment will cost about $26.5m per year, and will benefit about 1,020,000 children in about 610,000 <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The weekly rates that will be payable for <span class="highlight">families</span> of different sizes are as set out in the following table which, with the concurrence of honourable senators, I incorporate in Hansard: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The child endowment increases in the Bill will, as 1 have said, benefit over 1,000,000 children, spread in more than 600,000 <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The increases I have just outlined will help ease the financial stress facing many <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Assistance is given to <span class="highlight">families</span> through the National Health Act where the family insurance rates for a family with children - however many children - are pegged at the rate applicable to a married couple without children; special assistance is also provided for handicapped children and children of pensioners - the latter being a matter which I shall deal with more fully in a moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many social workers have drawn attention to the special hardship suffered by what are called ‘one parent <span class="highlight">families</span>’ and by <span class="highlight">families</span> where the breadwinner is incapacitated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Budget, as I have said, is especially oriented towards the needs of dependent children, particularly towards the needs of children in deprived <span class="highlight">families</span>, where there is bereavement or invalidity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are <span class="highlight">families</span> with 1 or  2  children not required to meet the high costs of living that are with us today? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think the Government could have been serious when, having said that the first child should receive endowment, it says at this late stage that only <span class="highlight">families</span> with more than  2  children shall receive an increased rate of child endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are levied in the most adverse circumstances and perpetrate harshness and cruelty on <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is he aware also that such illness is a significantly mounting burden of cost upon <span class="highlight">families</span>, benefit funds and governments and could cripple any national health scheme? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator emphasised one point that I was anxious to make and that is that there is an opportunity for the Government, without great expenditure, to assist the young lads and girls in our society by assisting research officers to find for these children homes with real identifiable <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But social and individual needs are interdependent and change in relation to time, to need cycles of individuals and <span class="highlight">families</span>, to prevailing ideas of what constitutes a need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their <span class="highlight">families</span>, if they are so fortunate to have them, are forced into debt to maintain them in the Homes because the subsidy plus pension are unrelated to the 1971 cost of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is impossible in many instances for the <span class="highlight">families</span> of elderly people who have commitments to their own children, to meet those commitments adequately and at the same time to care for elderly parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So a number of <span class="highlight">families</span>, of whom I have a record, has not received these benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that is entirely what  Senator Keeffe  meant I firmly believe that what  Senator Keeffe  was doing was to draw attention to the fact that what is being received by deserted wives with <span class="highlight">families</span> is not adequate to keep them at a decent standard of living and that some of them - I think this is what  Senator Keeffe  said - had resorted to this activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many <span class="highlight">families</span> depend on child endowment to help tide them over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister to do what he can to have this anomaly rectified because there must be thousands of <span class="highlight">families</span> in this position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the June-July issue of the Institute of Public Affairs magazine it is stated that 1,750,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia are receiving child endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of that number, 8,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> have 7 children; 3,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> have 8 children; 1,100 <span class="highlight">families</span> have 9 children; 400 <span class="highlight">families</span> have 10 children and 200 <span class="highlight">families</span> have 11 children or more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not mean to indicate that all those <span class="highlight">families</span> come within the category I have mentioned of eligibility for the student’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not have the figures on the number of <span class="highlight">families</span> which would be penalised in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The figures I have cited relate to <span class="highlight">families</span> with more than 6 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some action should be taken to restore to those <span class="highlight">families</span> the money they would have received under the old scheme of child endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some farmers, for example, may have to resolve concurrently or beforehand very complex issues associated with physically relocating themselves and their <span class="highlight">families</span> if there is to be an assurance of employment in the occupations for which training is sought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the <span class="highlight">families</span> of eligible farmers will also qualify for training if they have been working full-time on farming, other than on domestic responsibilities, for at least the 6 months prior to their applications for training, and if they have been wholly dependent for their livelihood on the income earned by the farm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it clear that of the 184,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> which, as low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, are eligible for assistance with health insurance only 13,000 have been approved by the Department of Social Ser-“ vices and that only about half of that small number have been protected fully by registering with a fund? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that it has been alleged in the Press that, because only some 12,000 low income <span class="highlight">families</span> had applied by 31st December 1970 for assistance under the subsidised health benefit plan, which was introduced on 1st January 1970, the plan had failed in its objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For administrative and statistical purposes beneficiaries under the plan are divided into 3 separate community groups eligible for assistance, namely, low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, unemployed, sickness and special beneficiaries, and migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the year ended 30th June 1971, 82,000 unemployment, sickness and special beneficiaries enrolled in health insurance funds, and in addition about 11,000 low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and about 28,000 migrants became members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is estimated that 84,000 of these consist of <span class="highlight">families</span> on low incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that 84,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> received assistance at a time of need and not 12,000 as has been suggested in some comments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new procedures involve the introduction of a simplified application form for low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and the adoption of one certificate for all beneficiaries, whether low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, or unemployed, sickness or special beneficiaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question refers to the expenditure of $397,000 by the Commonwealth Government to pay management expenses’ to the hospital and medical benefits funds at the rate of 6 per cent on the money that they handled in 1970-71 in dealing with bills under the subsidised medical scheme for low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, migrants and others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 claim for my Party credit for having influenced the Government to alter the flat rate system of child endowment payments and for granting an increased rate of payment in respect of all children in each family after the second child in order to assist big <span class="highlight">families</span> to get by. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have in front of me figures which indicate that the cost to the areas where these divisional offices have been functioning, from the point of view of the spending power of the <span class="highlight">families</span> in those areas is going to be tremendous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition is pleased that the Government has decided to move, at the very least, in this direction because the cost of maintaining elderly people in nursing homes has become a very great burden not only on the elderly people themselves but also on their sons and daughters who, more often than not, are flat out keeping pace with the ever-increasing cost of maintaining, rearing and educating their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the scheme was first mooted last year it was estimated that 84,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> and 271,000 persons would be eligible for assistance under the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These place an increasing burden on the management of the homes, on the organisations, on the people who voluntarily assist them and, of course, on the <span class="highlight">families</span> of those people who are patients in nursing homes where there is a gap between what might be given in Government assistance and what is the lowest charge which can be made by a nursing home with the required service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat that I regret that the Democratic Labor Party cannot see its way clear to support a genuine proposition put forward at this stage by the Labor movement to protect the take home pay of the ordinary average Australian workers, particularly those with <span class="highlight">families</span> and with dependents who suffer from chronic illnesses such as diabetes, asthma, ulcers or what have you. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Postmaster-General has since received many inquiries and representations from honourable members and honourable senators, town councils and others concerning the economic and social effects of the withdrawal of staff and their <span class="highlight">families</span> from country towns, some of which are already quite seriously affected by circumstances within the primary industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711027_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister give an assurance that the simplified revised procedures for applications, operative from 1st November 1971, will be distributed to all agencies including Darwin and that trade union organisations are supplied with details for publication in their journals to encourage low income <span class="highlight">families</span> to avail themselves of the benefits of the scheme? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that every wool farmer in Australia in his plight tonight, every member of their <span class="highlight">families</span>, every person in a country town, every storekeeper and every farm worker has made a mental note that in the Labor Party’s terms the Government in injecting valuable credit for the wool industry is squandering money which should have been used for social services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The remainder of the advances were used by State housing authorities to provide housing, primarily for persons of low or moderate means, with the proviso that they could be required to set aside in each year up to 5 per cent of the housing advances made by the Commonwealth for the construction of dwellings for servicemen’s <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711125_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Advances under the housing agreements with the States have been used to provide reasonably priced rental accommodation for low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and to assist these <span class="highlight">families</span> to own their own homes by the offer of low deposit long term loans at a concessional rate of interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711125_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At present many <span class="highlight">families</span> are unable to give the little bit of extra assistance in the way of education that they would like to give to their children because they are groaning under the burden of the interest rate of 7 per cent or 8 per cent that they have lo pay on their housing loans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only does it contribute to employment but it means that workers and their <span class="highlight">families</span> who have had a lifetime in isolated areas will be required to seek employment in the metropolitan area, thereby creating a demand on ail the community services provided in the metropolitan area - houseing, water supply, sewerage, power, roads and other services, in addition to schooling for their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The only comment I would make is that unemployment strikes with particular harshness in larger <span class="highlight">families</span> where the mar.gin between no income and some reasonable income, though inadequate, is slight and the situation becomes very desperate where a number of children are dependent on one breadwinner who becomes unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report went on to state that intimate dealings with the <span class="highlight">families</span> of the sick, with the chronically ill and the poverty ridden in our affluent society, as well as the anxious and socially incompetent, revealed that they found the fine print in insurance agreements very difficult to understand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is very difficult because those who do interest themselves in union affairs - everybody knows that that is a very small minority of the membership of any union today; my colleagues in the Labor Party know this, whether or not they will admit it - are those who take an interest, who have to stand up to not only the physical threats of violence against themselves but also the harassment of their wives and <span class="highlight">families</span> by telephone calls in the middle of the night which threaten and use vile language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I could quote a dozen cases, as undoubtedly  Senator Negus  could, in which <span class="highlight">families</span> who have lived on a farm for years have found that when the head of the family has died the demands of both Federal and State estate duty have made it essential to sell part of the property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Consistent with our aim of ensuring maximum membership control of organisations, we believe that the rank and file should have every opportunity of being consulted on the fundamental question of whether they should withdraw their labour by striking and so suffer loss of wages with consequent hardship to their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although, as  Senator McManus  did say, there is no severe drug problem in this country with young people at this time, he meant in effect what the Committee members pointed out in the report, that is, that although no severe overall problem in terms of numbers exists now sufficient young people are being affected as to make the problem serious for them and for their immediate <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Minister also notice that the ALP undertakes to provide <span class="highlight">families</span> whose taxable income is less than $1,700 with free health cover? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I respond to the question by pointing out that whilst the Leader of the Opposition in another place seems to make great play of his proposal that <span class="highlight">families</span> with a taxable income of less than $1,700 a year would receive free health care, he conveniently overlooks the fact that this Government provides free health care to people whose income is less than $2,417, not $1,700. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the latter proposition is the case, will not the 1.35 per cent compulsory levy be substantially more costly to the great majority of <span class="highlight">families</span> than is the present voluntary scheme? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In its development of policies for support of tertiary institutions and for assistance to students who can be expected to have a reasonable prospect of success in tertiary studies, the Commonwealth Government has preferred to direct its efforts to an increase in the number of awards and an improvement in the benefits for those from lower income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many who had a religious background opposed the reforms because of the poverty that would result in the <span class="highlight">families</span> in which children of  6  and  7  years of age were holding down jobs for  10  hours a day  6  days a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So we progressed from that stage, and Australia was part of the progression because in the early days of settlement of this country some of the people who were sent here from England as criminals were people who had been audacious enough to try to form industrial organisations to protect themselves and their <span class="highlight">families</span> from the circumstances that can so obviously emanate from a completely undisciplined and uncontrolled community with no laws to guide it in relation to manufacturing and other industries, whether they be coal mines, boot factories, spinning mills or the more modern versions that we have today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has any survey been conducted by the Department of Social Services as to the social effects that unemployment is having on rural communities, particularly in regard to persons who have <span class="highlight">families</span> to rear and educate, and who, in moving to other areas for employment, have to sell their homes at an under-valuation price in order to effect a sale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister representing the Minister for Housing say whether any consideration has been given to establishing housing loans for low income <span class="highlight">families</span> at extremely low interest rates which are more in line with the actual risk of the capital of the loans so that low income <span class="highlight">families</span> can have some chance of eventually owning their own home? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without doubt, it is a tax benefit situation or a tax reduction arrangement to look after people on middle and lower incomes, the people with responsibilities, the people with <span class="highlight">families</span> - the thrifty and the provident who traditionally have been the hard core of this country and have made this country great and strong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a most important matter and one which should, as other honourable senators have pointed out, lead to an encouragement for the people in the community to attempt to provide in the future estates to leave to their <span class="highlight">families</span> which will not be all taken by way of taxation at the point of death. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden)  said when introducing this most important national financial document of the year, it is ‘geared to achieve social and economic goals of significance to all Australians and particularly <span class="highlight">families</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present situation in which orchardists have to grub out their trees means that in many cases they must vacate that ground because the acreage they have is not sufficient to enable them to produce an economic crop which will support them and their <span class="highlight">families</span> over a period of 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the attention of the Minster representing the Minister for the Interior been drawn to a statement made by  Mr Edmund  Vestey in a recent radio interview in London, which was broadcast in Australia, in which  Mr Vestey  claimed that Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span> were burning the new homes which his company had constructed for them in the Northern Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite  Senator Poke  reading from the Budget Speech of the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden)  to try to prove the contrary, it sets out quite clearly the reductions in taxation over a wide range of incomes, and it proves quite clearly that the income tax concessions are aimed to benefit the lower income workers and those with <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely the Government does not need to hold an inquiry to discover that in practical terms thousands of <span class="highlight">families</span> are obliged to live close to the poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no objection to mothers being free to work if they want to do so, but by failing to increase child endowment the Government has positively disadvantaged those mothers who wish to give full time care to their <span class="highlight">families</span>, and particularly to their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the inquiry into the taxation system, which is to be conducted by  Mr Justice  Asprey, might consider the possibility of abolishing the present system of concessional tax deductions, except for those deductions which directly benefit <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The plan is a combination of, firstly, the probate and gift duty provisions; secondly, abolition of the means test, which will help the <span class="highlight">families</span> on the land; and, thirdly, the provision at the moment of $20m as a start to establish long term loans for diversification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposals for an increase in grants under the Home Savings Grant Act from $500 to $750 and the raising of the maximum value of a home which may attract a grant from $17,500 to $22,500 both reflect a realistic appraisal of housing costs and the needs of young <span class="highlight">families</span> in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This expansion of support measures for migrant <span class="highlight">families</span> should do much to break communication barriers and to help new Australians adjust to aa environment which cannot but be alien to them at first but which can offer them exceptional opportunities for security, prosperity and happiness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst congratulating the Government for its humane approach to the personal needs of migrant <span class="highlight">families</span>, I would like to refer to the way in which our migration policies go so far towards meeting so many of the basic needs of the entire nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since most <span class="highlight">families</span> do not have their own personal household effects with them on arrival not only are the flats fully furnished but also all necessary household equipment, including linen and cutlery, is provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The provision of $14 a week to <span class="highlight">families</span> which maintain their senior members in the home is indeed praiseworthy and should provide added incentive to family responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Previously where one family had been raking in income and little country towns were unknown, as a result of the soldier settlement scheme under the Cain Labor Government of the time in Victoria, those properties were cut up and many, many <span class="highlight">families</span> were placed on them to develop these areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am hoping that it will achieve a better end result for the ordinary Aborigine than was achieved last year and that the money will not flow into vested areas, to created positions, to empire building within a department in a way which will absorb the money and which will be of no use to the Aborigines and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One finds children of even well to do <span class="highlight">families</span> dropping out from the higher level of education and giving up scholarships, because despite their parents’ income, of which they are not necessarily beneficiaries, they arc denied the necessary living allowances that are made available to other members of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However such people certainly should not be economically squeezed as a result of having <span class="highlight">families</span> of that size. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People with smaller <span class="highlight">families</span> have to buy only one or two pens at the beginning of the school year but the mother of those 6 children will be paying 5c tax on every one of those 15c pens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A fully effective programme should both keep up with the growth rate in family formation, which is roughly estimated to be of the order of 1,200 new <span class="highlight">families</span> a year, and overcome the very substantial backlog. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I estimate that for the first time the allocation for 1972-73, taken along with what the States are doing with funds from their own resources, should provide enough houses to keep pace with .the rate of family formation amongst those <span class="highlight">families</span> wishing to occupy houses provided by governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The housing programmes aim primarily to assist <span class="highlight">families</span>, whose children will benefit thereby: a great deal of health activity is devoted to improving the health situation of Aboriginal infants and children; the bulk of expenditure in education is, of course, for younger Aborigines; while the employment training scheme and other activities of the Department of Labour and National Service seek in particular to assist schoolleavers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  insistence on the regular payment of moneys to the church at a rate beyond that which <span class="highlight">families</span> can economically afford has led to many cases of physical hardship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Forest farming is undoubtedly something that will have to come and <span class="highlight">families</span> should be playing their part in providing the forests of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I mention the disturbance of <span class="highlight">families</span> that have devoted themselves for years to the building up of only one asset which basically is land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But we have this situation where a penalty is imposed upon those people who have made honest endeavours throughout their lives to do what they could for their <span class="highlight">families</span> and dependants who are now penalised by this iniquitous form of taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can go further and relate this situation to the rural industry in which we have seen in recent years not just problems but great tragedies faced by many <span class="highlight">families</span> through the application of estate duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would hope, as  Senator Primmer  said tonight, that the State government will try to ease this duty in order to assist people to pass on some of their savings, which they have earned by a conscientious approach to their job and by applying thrift throughout their working lives, for the security of their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We equally believe that if people decide in their lifetime to do something for their children and to build something up in order to pass it on, that is thrift and providence, and they are entitled to pass it to their <span class="highlight">families</span> without having some person who has never tried to do anything in his life - I am not talking of anybody in this chamber, far from it - saying that they cannot do that, they shall not do that, or that they are not allowed to do that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Earlier in this debate  Senator Webster  in all innocence referred to the fact that the Commonwealth had raised the threshhold of probate duty, as far as <span class="highlight">families</span> are concerned, to $40,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator is amongst those who are grizzling and saying that the unemployment figures are the greatest threat the country has ever known when he knows as well as I do that there are many people who have 2 jobs and many <span class="highlight">families</span> who have 3 jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should subsidise private <span class="highlight">families</span> to fill the gap as that type of care would held less danger of psychiatric damage to the child than any institutionalised system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Practically anywhere at all north of the Tropic of Capricorn in Queensland, in the Northern Territory to a lesser degree, and in those areas in Western Australia where mining development has taken place or railway construction is being carried out, one can find large numbers of Islanders who have left their island homes because of the lack of employment opportunities for both themselves and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It must be borne in mind that under the Government scheme if the wife is working - and one-third of all wives work, particularly in the lower income <span class="highlight">families</span> - the wife as well as the husband will pay 1.35 per cent of her taxable income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No less than 85 per cent of the family homes to be built by State housing authorities with our advances will be allocated to <span class="highlight">families</span> in which the average gross weekly income of the main breadwinner (exclusive of any overtime and child endowment payments) does not exceed 85 per cent of average weekly earnings per employed male unit as denned in the Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those eligible will be mainly the lower income <span class="highlight">families</span> who are paying too high a proportion of their incomes in private rents or are living in unsatisfactory accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The agreement also provides that each State will ensure that the number of family dwellings allocated by its housing authority to <span class="highlight">families</span> who satisfy the needs test shall not be less than the total number of family dwellings built with our advances that become available during the year for allocation for the first time, and 25 per cent of the number of family dwellings constructed by the States with financial assistance under this and previous Commonwealth-State Housing Agreements that become available during the year for reallocation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Housing has suggested to the States that rents charged to <span class="highlight">families</span> with incomes close to the upper limit of the needs test should not exceed  22i  per cent of those incomes and that the proportions of income paid in rent should be reduced as income declines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the policy of the Government to avoid the development by State housing authorities of estates in which almost all the residents are in receipt of government housing assistance: there is a tendency on the part of some people to regard <span class="highlight">families</span> living in those areas as being second class citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is proposed, under the agreement, that the Commonwealth Minister will determine the amount of welfare housing advances to each State during the next 5 years, so that the Australian Government will be able to ensure that an increasing flow of finance will be available to the States to enable them to expand the construction of homes for needy persons and <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Earlier immigration to this country took place, in an era of larger <span class="highlight">families</span> which coincided with the tail end of the United States development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the numbers of larger <span class="highlight">families</span> tapered off and the population figure became static. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people who migrated to the United States from Europe usually had <span class="highlight">families</span>, the minimum number of which ranged from say 4 to 6 and the maximum from perhaps 10 to 12. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That was the reason why in the early life of this Government we endeavoured to accelerate the reuniting of <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is hardly conducive to achieving a smooth flow of locally-recruited workers even though the Company’s officers maintain that many Australians prefer to precede their <span class="highlight">families</span> and stay in the single men’s hostel in order to ‘look Whyalla over’ before bringing their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Anybody who has traced the history of housing from the bad old days of landlordism will recognise that <span class="highlight">families</span> can become attached to the area and the surroundings in which they live as well as the friendships formed in their district. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst he and the Labor Government accepted the principle that young married couples should be provided for in the new Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, there was a greater need to provide accommodation for the low income groups with <span class="highlight">families</span> and the other persons to whom I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In addition to those concessions and advantages the 1971 legislation provided a grant of $ 1.25m each year over a 5-year period for the purpose of providing, as the legislation indicated, assistance for needy <span class="highlight">families</span> and the type of accommodation they wanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The committee prepared a reasoned submission which did not oppose the entry of TAA but which .pointed out the danger of the loss of experienced pilots to Australian aviation and, from a humanitarian angle, the effect that any loss of employment would have on young men who have made aviation their life and on their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We tend to think of them as people who help individuals, <span class="highlight">families</span>, communities or groups of persons who happen to be disadvantaged in one way or another and that social workers are expected to contribute to the creation of conditions which will enhance social functioning and prevent personal breakdowns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Your petitioners believe that in addition to this basic per capita grants additional assistance should be provided in cases of educational disadvantage, but they believe that the appropriate instruments for reducing economic inequalities are taxation and social welfare systems which deal with individuals and <span class="highlight">families</span> and not with schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-0-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To the nearly 3 million Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> who at this moment are paying off their homes I say that next week or the week after- probably the week after, because that will be after the Parramatta by-election- every one of them will be paying substantially more by way of interest rates for their homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those grounds were, firstly, because it abdicates its responsibility as an instrument of economics and aggravates inflation; secondly, because it breaks a whole series of promises made in the policy speech; thirdly, because it places its main burden of costs upon lower income <span class="highlight">families</span>; fourthly, because it attacks the rural community; fifthly, because it dismantles the defences of this country; sixthly, because of its deceit and deception; and, seventhly, because, foreshadowed and presented as a document of great historic reform, it is, in fact, a gross anti-climax and a confidence trick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the report of the Committee was presented to the Parliament, I, as a member of the then Opposition, recalled in detail the heartrending examples that we saw at first hand of the problems of many children and their parents and, probably to a greater extent, the problems of the non-handicapped members of <span class="highlight">families</span> which have mentally or physically handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government, in seeking action which it says will control inflation, is seeking to cut back spending by ordinary <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In directing a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, I refer to a statement made by the Minister appearing at page 3219 of the House of Representatives Hansard in which he said that for three out of four <span class="highlight">families</span>, including those in which there is a working wife, the proposed national health plan would be cheaper than the present system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of them even like to see their <span class="highlight">families</span> occasionally during the parliamentary sittings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those days those who attended schools such as the Christian Brothers College and the De La Salle College in largely working class areas such as Burwood and Ashfield came from <span class="highlight">families</span> the income of which was far below those of <span class="highlight">families</span> with pupils attending independent schools such as the Riverview College where the famous Father Jordan has had so much to say on this present controversy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If anybody went along with me to the All Hallows Convent at Haberfield in the Evans electorate he would find not only that that school is attended by children from low income <span class="highlight">families</span> but also that the problem is compounded by migrant children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, of what use are programs for the aged, except in a limited way, in the rapidly burgeoning areas in the fringe suburbs of our cities where young <span class="highlight">families</span> often on low and inadequate incomes are congregated? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, the reverse situation would apply if a rigid commitment were made as a matter of centralised policy making that the priority would be given to programs for the needs of young <span class="highlight">families</span> while the needs of the aged were ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I do think that in this society certainly not enough attention is being given to the position of young <span class="highlight">families</span> or of young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the economic and social position of young <span class="highlight">families</span> whose income is inadequate and whose children may, as the end result, suffer deprivation and denial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is obviously one of the ways in which the needs of young <span class="highlight">families</span>, and particularly the needs of young children, can at least be provided for in part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We virtually have not succeeded at all in our campaign- certainly in no large measure- in persuading either the previous government or this Government of the need for an adequate provision for child endowment in the case of <span class="highlight">families</span> which have more than a certain number of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It says with quite a degree of balance that one cannot give an undue accent to the disregard of the position of the aged any more than one can give an undue accent to the disregard of the position of the younger <span class="highlight">families</span> and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If public submissions are sought from interested bodies, I would indicate at this stage that if the Democratic Labor Party is invited to make a submission and if it is appropriate to do it or if in response to a request we are permitted to do so, we will make a submission to this body on the need for adequate child endowment as one of the most practical, one of the easiest and one of the most justifiable ways of assisting young <span class="highlight">families</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as <span class="highlight">families</span> are concerned, this action undoubtedly means a rise in the price of soft drinks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was a great figure in the Australian Labor Party, best known for his able leadership, his great endeavours to bring Australia out of the difficulties of the Second World War into an area of prosperity and to overcome the social difficulties which had arisen to allow the young men who had had their lives disrupted to find their way back into society and to make it easier for <span class="highlight">families</span> to be founded, and for society to reestablish itself in Australia after that terrible war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clearly, any extension of these limits arising from further increases in the rates of pensioner benefits would create situations of inequity between such pensioners and the many non-pensioner <span class="highlight">families</span> in the community who have weekly incomes less than these amounts but who are required to take out health insurance coverage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But in the main it is still in the hands of the proprietary companies of the <span class="highlight">families</span> who have ploughed back all the money they have made over the years and who have built up something which is an asset not only to themselves- in my opinion they have been very selfless people- but also the districts in which they are situated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In many cases people have to wait until positions are available, and it would seem to me to be reasonable to expect that they should receive benefits that others get because in many cases those young people are helping to keep <span class="highlight">families</span> going or would be expected to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the fact that the IATA group of international airlines have asked for a 6 per cent rise in fares, will the Government investigate the lavishness of these international airlines in the great reductions in fares which they give to members of domestic airlines staff, many of whom have nothing whatsoever to do with selling air travel, and their <span class="highlight">families</span> and relatives? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present scheme disadvantages some people in the community, mainly low income earners, especially those with large <span class="highlight">families</span> and pensioners, who presently receive what can only be regarded as a second-class health service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We seek to amend extensively the present National Health Act in order to eliminate the weaknesses in the voluntary scheme and to extend its coverage to the low-income single earner, to those with larger <span class="highlight">families</span>, to pensioners, to newly arrived migrants and to aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But this Bill in its present form and with its associated proposals will clearly do the following: It will lower the quality of medical care for Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>; it will increase the total costs for the Government and thus for taxpayers; it will increase total costs for the majority of taxpayers, because they could only maintain the present quality of their health care by additional heavy commitments for private insurance; it will reduce freedom of choice; it will jeopardise the future of religious, private and country hospitals; and by design and intent it will be the first stage of nationalisation of health and medical care in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition opposes the legislation and will vote against it because we believe that it will lower the quality of medical care for Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>; that it will increase the total costs for the Government and thus the taxpayers; that it will increase total costs for the majority of taxpayers because they can maintain the present quality of their health care only by additional heavy commitments for private insurance; that it will reduce the freedom of choice; that it will jeopardise the future of religious, private and country hospitals; and by design and intent it will be the first stage of nationalisation of health and medical care in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because we believe that the proposal of the socialist Minister will mean a downgrading of the medical service and a consequent lowering of the standards of health care to Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>, because it will destroy the existing scheme, increase the total cost to the Government and for the majority of taxpayers, because it will mean the end of private and religious hospitals, and, above all because it will mean the end of the freedom of choice of patients with respect to their doctor or hospital, we totally reject the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The additional cost of that extra insurance is an allowable deduction for taxation purposes and that cost, with the basic levy of 1.35 per cent of taxable income, for most people in the community and for most <span class="highlight">families</span> will still be less than the cost of hospital and medical insurance under the present scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The subsidised health insurance program at best could cover only four out of every 100 low income <span class="highlight">families</span> which it was supposed to cover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The points we made were, firstly, that it would lower the quality of medical care to Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>; second, that it would increase the total cost to the Government and thus to the taxpayer; third, that it would increase the cost to an individual because, in addition to increased taxation, expensive additional private insurance would be required to maintain health care standards; fourth, that it would reduce the freedom of choice of doctors and hospitals; fifth, that it would jeopardise the future of religious, private and country hospitals; and, sixth, that it would be the first stage of nationalisation of health care in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely it is a personal responsibility, and it is for each and every one of us for ourselves and our <span class="highlight">families</span> to accept that responsibility; but surely it is also a responsibility that should be shared by Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are people who, in the main, are the sorts of people for whom the community must take responsibility- age pensioners, single mothers, people on low incomes with large <span class="highlight">families</span> and people who just do not think about the necessity for cover and who are irresponsible but who, with this Government’s scheme, will be forced to discipline themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While the divorce rate has risen in Australia rather slowly and not in accord with many other developed western countries whose divorce rates are much higher, nonetheless there is every indication that <span class="highlight">families</span> and marriage are institutions which are not upheld in the strongest regard by the great majority of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The general statement can fairly be made that most women between the ages of 25 and 40 withdraw from the work force because they become mothers and they have to care for their children to the stage when they feel the children are old enough or independent enough to look after themselves and where harm will not be done to the <span class="highlight">families</span> if the women do go out to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A conservative assessment currently is that approximately 5,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia are in a situation where the husband habitually batters the wife and, almost inevitably in those circumstances, the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Therefore if we are, to use a quaint Australianism, fair dinkum about wanting good family law, wanting conciliation, wanting to restore marriages, wanting to help <span class="highlight">families</span>, we will clearly have to make a new and vigorous study of all phases of the family and we will have to look to see how we can help the family from its very earliest stages, even from premarriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No matter how much people may seek to argue that the words in the Bill constitute a genuine separation they are arguing, I believe, an impossibility because I cannot accept- I do not believe that ordinary people faced with ordinary situations would acceptthat if a husband and wife are living together under the same roof, in one house, in which the wife provides the daily meals for the husband and in which she provides other household services, such as washing his clothes, making his bed and doing all the other household chores which happily married <span class="highlight">families</span> would expect a wife to do for a husband, that constitutes a separation which ought to be regarded as a separation for the purpose of divorce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many of these actions were taken in haste for the benefit of the people of Darwin, for the reconstruction and continuation of commerce in the city, for reuniting <span class="highlight">families</span> where evacuation was necessary and, in general, for the overall well being of Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will be supported by an advisory council which will be further assisted by that special type of person that seems to have developed in Darwin, the person with initiative and enterprise who, given this sort of legislation, can immediately set about building homes and re-establishing <span class="highlight">families</span> in Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition, so far as it can within its resources, the Corporation will make housing loans available to <span class="highlight">families</span>, using the family allowance provisions in the Australian Consitution, and it will also make loans to those other specific categories of home-seekers for whom the Australian Government has a constitutional responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this matter, the sole role of the Australian Government was to bring eligible children to suitable adoptive <span class="highlight">families</span> as promptly and as safely as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As soon as the Australian Government received advice that the first requirement had been met and that on the second the States had approved 246 adopting <span class="highlight">families</span>, arrangements were made to bring the orphans by Hercules transport to Bangkok and by chartered Qantas jet to Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Faced with this fact, my Government determined that it could do nothing in the matter of allocating children to <span class="highlight">families</span> as this was clearly a State responsibility and therefore if there was to be any disagreement between adoptive <span class="highlight">families</span> about the children then it was a matter for the States to determine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These changes include a growing number of <span class="highlight">families</span> where both parents work, and of single parent <span class="highlight">families</span>, as well as a frequently increasing sense of isolation affecting women looking after children at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Realising the tremendous amount of loneliness in a large number of migrant <span class="highlight">families</span>, especially womenfolk who are at home for most or all of the day by themselves while their husbands are at work and their children are at school, I and the Government for some time have been keen to establish a form of ethnic broadcasting to try to help break down these tremendous language barriers and this horrible feeling of isolation on the part of a large number of people, especially the womenfolk to whom I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those yet to be housed are Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span> which do not meet such tenancy requirements and who are causing so much trouble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, the Australian Government, which is committed to a policy of housing all Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span>, whatever requirements they meet, within 10 years from the time of elections, has provided funds to the Western Australian Government for a housekeeping service whereby women who are employed for the purpose will visit the homes and try to instruct the tenants as to how properly to look after a European home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That sum has gone into a fund, for which the Western Australian Government has supplied $411,500, the Australian Government through my Department financing the housekeeping service of those who have to call on Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Western Australian Government is, in the provision of the housekeeping service, calling on European <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The disproportionate cost would indicate that there are more European <span class="highlight">families</span> than Aborigines who cannot meet the tenancy requirements of the Western Australian Housing Commission, but as there are still more Aborigines outside the requirements of the Housing Commission my Department would willingly provide greater housekeeping services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That because of the excessively high inflation rate, the Government decision to decrease the taxable allowance for education expenses from $400 to $ 1 50 per student will create unreasonable financial pressures upon many <span class="highlight">families</span> and will cause great difficulty for such <span class="highlight">families</span> to provide their children with an adequate education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-0-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This problem arises out of large urban societies creating loneliness and, for mothers in particular but for <span class="highlight">families</span> as a whole, creating problems which can be overcome by greater communication and association with people around them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reason the Government gives for the necessity to introduce this Bill is that changing social patterns have put considerable pressures on <span class="highlight">families</span> with infant and school-age children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government would look after its own housekeeping, stop intruding into areas that are not a proper role for government, fix inflation and ease taxation, our <span class="highlight">families</span> would be able to look after themselves and areas of disadvantage would be reduced to such small pockets that existing and voluntary agencies could well take care of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After robbing <span class="highlight">families</span> of $74m which the Government says is to be expended on all children in Australia, the Government then allocates priorities to those children whose parents are engaged in employment, to those children who are not being cared for in their own homes, to those children who need assistance and to those children who are sick and physically disabled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government is taking $74m away from <span class="highlight">families</span> that have been made paupers by the Government and directing it towards financing the disruption of <span class="highlight">families</span>, introducing the bureaucratisation of children and creating a diminishing ability in parents to make their own decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some weeks ago I asked him about Medibank refusing to pay for medical services rendered by doctors to doctors and members of their <span class="highlight">families</span> or doctors in partnership and their <span class="highlight">families</span>, and received the reassurance from the Minister that he would see that this practice was stopped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me put this to the Opposition: After some 4 weeks of debate on this matter, surely the Opposition has come to the conclusion that by a simple act on its part, that is by walking across the floor, the Supply Bills could be passed, this crisis would be over, we could proceed to pass the necessary legislationwe now have a considerable backlog of legislation- and we could have an opportunity to be with our <span class="highlight">families</span> for the Christmas period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A substantial number of <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia are dependant upon a single income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One objective is to achieve a more equitable distribution of the burden of taxation that is borne by individual taxpayers, especially in single income <span class="highlight">families</span>- that is, the worker who has a dependent wife and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said that the provision of a minimum rebate of $540 for taxpayers whose eligible rebatable expenditure is $1,350 or less, will operate as a disincentive to saving through life insurance and will discourage <span class="highlight">families</span> from spending on the education of their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One would have thought that his reuniting with their <span class="highlight">families</span> at Christmas 1972 the kids who were held in the gaols of Australia because they were acting in accordance with their conscience would have justified a longer term in office than he had had when he was forced to an election in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyhow, what is expense when measured against the suffering and hardship of thousands of <span class="highlight">families</span> who have been left destitute by cyclones? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, there were community committees for health centres, school boards with representation from parents, students and teachers and community representation on vital bodies such as the committee which allocates emergency housing to distressed <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 1973, the Henderson Inquiry into Poverty estimated that there were approximately 132 000 fatherless <span class="highlight">families</span>- that is, <span class="highlight">families</span> supported by women- in Australia at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, 37.5 per cent of these <span class="highlight">families</span> had a net income below Henderson’s poverty line, and an additional 12.6 per cent had an income less than 20 per cent above the poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thus, half the <span class="highlight">families</span> supported by women were poor or very poor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The application of the means test introduced by the present Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations,  Mr Tony  Street, and the reduction in training allowance represents a positive disincentive to retrain for women of low dual-income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eligible persons comprise certain low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, persons in receipt of social security unemployment, sickness and special benefits, and migrants during their first 2 months in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister pointed out in her second reading speech, the people who are eligible for these benefits are low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, people on unemployment and sickness benefits and other special benefits and migrants during their first 2 months in Australia in the settling down period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people, especially if they have large <span class="highlight">families</span>, will be disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is seeking to reduce spending it should let honourable senators know precisely what it intends to do, rather than abolishing altogether the benefits of which at least some of the low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and groups have availed themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main administrative savings will be in the area of staff employed by the Department of Social Security on means testing for the low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gave some hope not only to women who had been out of the workforce and who wanted to go back and be retrained but also to women who knew that they were going to have the responsibility of raising their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of them were women who were on their own and who were going to have the responsibility of raising their family and some of them were women who knew that, because of the type of man to whom they were married, they would always have to accept part of the responsibility of looking after their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But all of that is very tentative and they knew that it was not really going to provide the sort of life that they wanted for their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These people, many of whom are refugees, are unaware whether their <span class="highlight">families</span> are well, whether they have been ordered not to write, whether they are being reeducated or whether they are in concentration camps. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The government should assist disadvantaged <span class="highlight">families</span> where a single parent, a father, is caring for children, whether he is a widower or a deserted husband. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that in this category there are some 25 000 <span class="highlight">families</span> and perhaps up to 50 000 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, their main interest was to feed, clothe, shelter and educate their children- in other words, to bring up their <span class="highlight">families</span> with dignity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inequalities in our community now reflect not so much gross disparities in income, but the failure of successive Liberal governments to create opportunities for the overwhelming majority of our people- the lower, modest and middle income <span class="highlight">families</span>- opportunities which only governments can make. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs: Is she aware that the National Conference on Adoption which was held in Sydney in February gave total support to the placement in Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span> of all Aboriginal children available for adoption or fostering? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the importance of meat in householdexpenditure rapid price increases place great burdens on persons on low income, persons on fixed incomes, larger <span class="highlight">families</span> and pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the debate that has ensued between  Senator Baume  on the one hand and my colleague  Senator Grimes  on the other illustrates the bind that lay members of the community are involved in when it comes to a matter of prescription for themselves or for the members of their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The former Labor Government demonstrated itself as a government not caring about people who live in remote areas and the difficulties experienced by <span class="highlight">families</span> living in those areas on a day to day basis, as well as the difficulties involved in operating an industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The theory was, therefore, that people could be persuaded- not in so many words and not explicitly or honestly- by governments to keep down the size of their <span class="highlight">families</span>, and thereby do something about the population explosion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The obvious example that comes to mind here is the man trying to raise a family on his own with the enormous difficulties he meets trying to do that, the enormous limitations which that role places on his earning potential and the consequent difficulties which <span class="highlight">families</span> in that situation fall into. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whereas before the one parent family was disadvantaged, now provisions are made which make it easier for such <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many of the fishermen around the Tasmanian coast operate in relatively small fishing vessels and they and their <span class="highlight">families</span> are terribly sensitive to the weather conditions there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do not know the background; we do not know a lot of the circumstances; we do not know what sort of a home life they have had or what sort of upbringing they have had; we do not know what impediments they have had to their development as citizens in the Australian community; we do not know what sicknesses have occurred in their <span class="highlight">families</span> or what other human or social problems they might have had, At least I have seen some of the benefits of this scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In attempts such as this, in which the Government is attempting to exclude from benefits everyone whom it considers to be a dole bludger, inevitably large numbers of people, especially those with large <span class="highlight">families</span>, are caught up in the net, cannot receive their benefit entitlements and must go to voluntary social security agencies for help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The allowance was set because the Labor Government realised that people who were to be students under NEAT would have to be well established in view of their domestic commitments for home, <span class="highlight">families</span>, schooling, etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister appreciate that so-called light jobs are almost non-existent and that employers shy off persons with a diminished work capacity thereby placing these people in a serious financial situation in which they cannot in some instances support their <span class="highlight">families</span> adequately? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister further appreciate the fact that persons in receipt of the unemployment benefit seeking to increase their earnings by casual work have a very limited allowance in this connection, thereby subjecting their <span class="highlight">families</span> to a standard of living well below the poverty level? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the end of the motion add the words: but the Senate is of the opinion that: (a) the problems of the canned fruit industry are a legacy of the overexpansion of the production base fostered by successive Liberal and Country Party Governments throughout the 1960s, and (b) the Government should consider immediately the Australian Industry Development Corporation report handed down in September 1975, with u view towards significant rationalisation of this industry to prevent further hardship to growers and their <span class="highlight">families</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To see everythingtheir lifetime, perhaps in many instances every cent that they have in this world, the work of their wives and <span class="highlight">families</span>- crumbling or potentially crumbling before their eyes is not a pleasant sight for anybody who appreciates their position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Australian Capital Territory, because of the structure of the population and the number of young <span class="highlight">families</span> here, it is a matter of particular importance and one which has faced some problems recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I was about to say, women in country areas sometimes have an even harder row to hoe because at least in some areas of our cities people can occasionally board a tram- when the tram runsand go to communicate with their fellows, with people who speak the same language or with their <span class="highlight">families</span>, although that is becoming increasingly difficult in the cities which we have created. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they were given some training that enabled them to obtain qualifications they would then be able to hold down a job while looking after their <span class="highlight">families</span> and to stand up in the community as equal citizens and not as ones relying on government handouts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the same token there are women in the community who because of their domestic circumstances- they may have a husband who is an alcoholic and upon whom they can never depend to bring in a regular income but who brings in some income- should be given the chance to achieve those qualifications that will enable them to look after their <span class="highlight">families</span> in a solid fashion without, as has been suggested to some of them by some government employees, having to leave their husbands and so entitle themselves to the supporting mother’s benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In some quarters it has been suggested that the decline in fertility since 197 1 is a temporary phenomenon due largely to a recent marked change in attitudes towards starting <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While there is some evidence of deferment of first births in some <span class="highlight">families</span>, this in itself seems to have been only a minor factor in the severe fall in fertility since 197 1. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question has to be posed: How can <span class="highlight">families</span> who earn below 85 per cent of the average weekly wage and who are eligible for rental accommodation from the State housing commissions buy a home or even rent satisfactory accommodation from the private sector? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We did this as an interim measure after asking each State to indicate the additional amount of money that it could use for the commencement of new dwellings before 30 June 1973, for allocation by various State housing authorities to construct rental housing for needy <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Federal Labor Government had remained in office, by the end of this financial year that Government, in agreement with the States, would have been responsible for the provision of rental accommodation for approximately 2 1 000 <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the same period, through the operation of the Home Builders’ Account, Labor would have provided approximately 30 000 other <span class="highlight">families</span> with finance to enable them to buy their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last year when two or three of these <span class="highlight">families</span> tried to buy the homes they were told by the State Department that they could have them for upwards of $ 1 8,000 to $20,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The children and these <span class="highlight">families</span> will now benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous system was of no assistance to low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that low income <span class="highlight">families</span> will come out about even. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to  Senator Wridet  that the evidence suggests that low income <span class="highlight">families</span> will benefit very much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It makes far better sense to introduce non-taxed family allowances of a substantial nature, as recommended by Professor Henderson, to make sure that the poor <span class="highlight">families</span> really do get some benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the evidence shows that these <span class="highlight">families</span> are large <span class="highlight">families</span>, migrant <span class="highlight">families</span> or <span class="highlight">families</span> with only one parent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is particularly important in the case of the many <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia where young children are being reared and where the wife and mother decides that the best role she can play, in relation to the welfare of her family, is to remain at home and not go out into the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures show that 300 000 Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> will be better off under this proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They include Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span> and <span class="highlight">families</span> who are on incomes of $ 100 a week or on the so-called minimum wage or slightly above it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Families</span> with 6 children will be $23 a week better off, which means that the family with $100 a week coming into the household will have a further $23 or 23 per cent more money coming in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, not all <span class="highlight">families</span> have 6 children but every one of those 300 000 <span class="highlight">families</span> will be better off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is notorious that Australians with <span class="highlight">families</span> spend their money; they do not put it away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We speak for and on behalf of ourselves, our <span class="highlight">families</span> and the Aboriginal people of Menindee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increased family allowances announced by the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  and their effect on underprivileged <span class="highlight">families</span>, I feel, are one of the most important steps that this Government or any government has taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will have a great effect on migrant <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of people with large <span class="highlight">families</span> or <span class="highlight">families</span> with chronically ill members, there is very great anxiety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>No jobs are available for women seeking to support themselves or their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is employment then I think at this stage it should be given to those currently trying to support <span class="highlight">families</span> on the dole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There have been breakdowns in <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intention, as I understand it, is for the teachers to be employed as primary teachers at schools with high numbers of pupils from migrant <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-48-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That reduction of the age limit from six years to eighteen months for patients eligible to receive cows’ milk substitutes as a pharmaceutical benefit under the schedules of the National Health Act will cause serious financial hardship to many <span class="highlight">families</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will it be assessing the changes on family income structure following the recent announcement by the Government, and the disabilities suffered by those <span class="highlight">families</span> whose incomes have been diminished as a result of the Medibank levy and health fund payments, the removal of tax deductions on mortgage loans, probable cost increases arising from the slashing of Government programs and foreshadowed indirect taxation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What comes through clearly from the figures is that those people with large <span class="highlight">families</span> receive a distinct benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister has already announced that funding for child care services this year will be given a priority because of the very urgent need in most parts of Australia for these support services for <span class="highlight">families</span> and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mortgage interest rate taxation deductions for <span class="highlight">families</span> have been excluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, I do not have time to go into the detail of what is involved in the area of assistance to <span class="highlight">families</span> but I will refer to statements made by the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  relating to child endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That will give far greater assistance to poorer <span class="highlight">families</span>, particularly as the endowment has been increased significantly, while at the same time the dependent children’s allowance for taxation purposes has been abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although they distribute money to the people, as I think  Senator Martin  said yesterday, and give benefits to some of the poor <span class="highlight">families</span>, especially the larger poor <span class="highlight">families</span>, they also distribute money to some of the wealthy <span class="highlight">families</span> and some of the rich larger <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to use this opportunity to say something about those things which are my direct responsibility and in particular to speak of the assistance for <span class="highlight">families</span> which was announced in the measures outlined last week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consistent with this philosophy, the new system of family allowances will give great assistance to the <span class="highlight">families</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It represents a major improvement in the Australian social welfare system and it improves the situation of those <span class="highlight">families</span> who are most in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is based on giving large non-taxable increases in family allowances to all <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We abolished the tax rebate system because we were aware that about 300 000 <span class="highlight">families</span> in the lower income group in this country would not take advantage of the tax rebate scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recognised that there were about 800 000 children in these <span class="highlight">families</span> and realised that the whole system of child endowment needed to be restructured so that assistance could be directed to all children and to all <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of some <span class="highlight">families</span> being able to take advantage of a $200 rebate for the first child and a rebate for other children, the same allowances will be made for all children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were influenced in this decision very strongly by the poverty report of Professor Henderson which talked of the way in which we could direct assistance to <span class="highlight">families</span> by abolishing tax rebates, thus enabling a larger amount to be distributed amongst the children in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were influenced by the figures relating to <span class="highlight">families</span> which have one to three children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of children in <span class="highlight">families</span> which have one child totals 668 000; in <span class="highlight">families</span> with 2 children, 730 000; and in <span class="highlight">families</span> with 3 children, 352 000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of children in <span class="highlight">families</span> with four or more children total 1 74 000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a case of looking at the <span class="highlight">families</span> which could have the greatest benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also gave heavy increases to those <span class="highlight">families</span> with four or more children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is important to me and to my department is that the new benefit will be a help to those <span class="highlight">families</span> where there is a single breadwinner or perhaps where there is a single parent looking after children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The lower income <span class="highlight">families</span>, as I mentioned before, who could not take advantage of the tax rebate, will have this immediate extra support directed to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all these ways we are hoping that this will be one very positive step towards the alleviation of poverty for the 300 000 low income <span class="highlight">families</span> whom I mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe it is a major step forward in the Government’s objective of directing welfare payments to <span class="highlight">families</span> whose needs are the greatest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You must bear in mind that the safety of the skipper and crew of a fishing boat and the welfare and future of their <span class="highlight">families</span> depends upon making satisfactory catches and returning to port safely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you can achieve this, you will be preventing a great deal of worry and anxiety in fishermen’s <span class="highlight">families</span> and I honestly think that from time to time, the loss of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that he has very strong support from the <span class="highlight">families</span> of those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have even read in newspapers from time to time of people who allegedly have not received a benefit and have gone out to obtain money by unlawful acts because they needed to feed their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to congratulate the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  who has recently made it possible for those <span class="highlight">families</span> to apply for and receive relief from her department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will do this by substantially increasing family allowances for <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will overcome the existing anomaly that, upon a child reaching 16 years and becoming a student, the total amount payable increases in one and two child <span class="highlight">families</span> but decreases in <span class="highlight">families</span> where there are more than two children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposals outlined arise from a review of the manner in which assistance for <span class="highlight">families</span> is now available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most <span class="highlight">families</span> receive assistance for children under 16 years of age and students by way of child endowment and personal income tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the benefits that are available to some taxpayers by way of tax rebates for children do not apply to some 300 000 <span class="highlight">families</span> whose incomes are insufficient to enable them to take advantage of those tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government regards it as of first importance that these <span class="highlight">families</span> who, as a class, are those most in need, should receive the additional financial help which this Bill will provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increases in the sole parent rebate and the rebate for a dependent spouse will be of benefit to all single income <span class="highlight">families</span> which are subject to taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For such <span class="highlight">families</span> they will more than offset any reduction in assistance for children arising from the substitution of increased family allowances for personal income tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be payable by Australian residents who do not have appropriate cover for themselves and their <span class="highlight">families</span> with a registered private insurance fund, or through payment of a premium to Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No levy will be paid by <span class="highlight">families</span> earning less than a bit over $4,000 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 2Vi per cent tax levy to finance Medibank will place an even greater strain on the wage packet of most Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure all honourable senators have been besieged with inquiries from their constituents as to where they stand with regard to the new proposals and what sort of action they should take in order to ensure that they and their <span class="highlight">families</span> are properly covered for all eventualities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sort of information that is needed is how many single persons in the community are above that income, which is able to be determined, and how many one-income <span class="highlight">families</span> are in the situation of earning $8,600 a year or more, which is able to be determined, but statistics just are not available to show how many 2-income <span class="highlight">families</span> are earning above $8,600 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has undertaken between now and 1 October to conduct an intensive scheme of education and information for the public so that members of the public will understand what their alternatives are and what steps need to be taken by them to ensure that they have the type of cover which they choose for themselves and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator McAuliffe spoke of the exemptions for low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important in the plans that we have for health care in this country that low income <span class="highlight">families</span> not be deprived of the quality of health care that we would want to see for everyone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether there are many people who would suggest in a personal sense that advances in modern medicine should not be applied to that area or to the members of their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that the Australian people will be convinced that they should have one form of health cover or another unless they are convinced that it is the one which best suits them and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We recognise that these measures involve a transfer of money to large <span class="highlight">families</span>, to rich <span class="highlight">families</span> as well as poor, and also a transfer of money within <span class="highlight">families</span> which is an innovation in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They give increases in money paid to some very poor <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I impress upon the Senate, and I would not like the publicity that has been given to these measures to get away from it, that the measures do not solve the problems of poor <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So many of our large <span class="highlight">families</span> and single parent <span class="highlight">families</span> live in areas devoid of family support services and the extra money supplied to mothers in this way will not buy the services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He recommended increases of this order in child endowment to relieve poverty in <span class="highlight">families</span> with children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This recognises the fact which many people forget- that in absolute numbers there are more <span class="highlight">families</span> in poverty with one or two children than with four or five children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, this obviously reflects the spread of children throughout <span class="highlight">families</span> in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Professor Henderson recommended that supportive family services of all types should be made available on a local basis to allow more independence and to give an increased range of choices to such <span class="highlight">families</span> in terms of allocating times between earning and staying at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a major innovation which will assist <span class="highlight">families</span> and the poor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a Bill about allowances to <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has, as the main part of its proposal, the maintenance and preservation of cash resources for poor <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This extremely important report has made a number of observations about poverty and <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer honourable senators to pages 208 to 210 of the main report where the following general propositions were established: That there is a relationship between poverty and the size of <span class="highlight">families</span>, and it is important that we should understand this; and that there is no relationship between poverty and the earning capacity, the single wage of the heads of <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It merely shows that the resources, the wages, the cash available to large <span class="highlight">families</span> is inadequate for their needs and that the size of a family tends to be the determinant of poverty in that family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Professor Henderson and his group pointed out that child endowment or family allowances are more useful to poor <span class="highlight">families</span> than to wealthy <span class="highlight">families</span>; that the allowances are more critical in providing the cash resources available to poor <span class="highlight">families</span>; and that the provision of family allowances is the appropriate way to increase the cash resources of poor <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rebates or concessions which are being abolished of course are of more value to wealthy <span class="highlight">families</span> who can gain more from the rebate system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer, for example, to the paper entitled  Resources for Poor <span class="highlight">Families</span>: An Experimental Income Supplement Scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next I look at the paper entitled  Chronic Poverty: City and Country <span class="highlight">Families</span>  which refers to a guaranteed family income as being one means of alleviating the poverty which is recognised in the paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then I look at the paper entitled  Poverty Among Aboriginal <span class="highlight">Families</span> in Adelaide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, cash will be mobilised into <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the first occasion for some considerable time when <span class="highlight">families</span> as such have been favoured in welfare matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The giving of assistance to <span class="highlight">families</span> in this way is a high priority matter and one which I am glad our Government has taken up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again it is a provision that will help to put cash into the hands of <span class="highlight">families</span> in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill, by favouring large <span class="highlight">families</span>- Professor Henderson has told us that they are the <span class="highlight">families</span> who often are poor- seeks to redistribute income in 2 ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will redistribute it from the richer <span class="highlight">families</span> who previously had the benefit of the rebate towards the poorer <span class="highlight">families</span> who require cash assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will also enable a redistribution of income within <span class="highlight">families</span> by giving money to women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because of the taxation disadvantage which many <span class="highlight">families</span> suffer that they have been driven out of the inner cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are measures which will give to <span class="highlight">families</span> something which they will need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that this Bill represents the first of a number of steps which our Government will take to alleviate poverty and to try to attack some of the problems which the commission of inquiry into povery recommended to aid the poor, to improve the status of women and to sustain <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not putting the benefit into the pockets of the low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly does not give the assistance to the low income <span class="highlight">families</span> that I hoped it would. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement by  Mr Lynch  that the new arrangements will be of particular benefit to Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span> and his documentary evidence in his fiscal policy on last Thursday week that there are drastic cuts in Aboriginal programs do not match up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is an indication that the benefits for Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span> under this Government are to be better than they were before- and this is one of those programs- quite frankly I do not want to see any of the disadvantages which may still be up the Treasurer’s sleeve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such young <span class="highlight">families</span> already feel that they are disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But nowhere in those reports is there any mention of a decrease in relation to the essential social services that should be made available to people who are not in a financial position- some of them are not even in a physical or mental condition- to be able to provide those things for their <span class="highlight">families</span> and themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill increases the amount of money allocated to <span class="highlight">families</span> for their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that this is a very important measure, particularly to poor people and those who are working for a living but not always able to provide for their <span class="highlight">families</span> the necessary items that they would like to provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is going to have a tremendous effect in particular on the mothers of the poorer <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That may be all right in some <span class="highlight">families</span> but I know of many <span class="highlight">families</span> in which it is not working out or has not worked out very well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Think of the houses that people with  Targe  and small <span class="highlight">families</span> need to have provided for them at a price they can afford. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">families</span> where husbands and wives work as a team, in many instances the Government is taking from the husband and giving to the wife. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">families</span> which are not a team, the Government is giving to the wife but she will lose because her husband will take from the housekeeping money the extra amount he sees her getting in child endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Baume talked about large <span class="highlight">families</span> and poverty, large <span class="highlight">families</span> and cash. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What do large <span class="highlight">families</span> need? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many payments of child endowment would it take to provide efficient economic public transport systems which would meet the needs of large <span class="highlight">families</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many child endowment payments would it take to give <span class="highlight">families</span>, large or small, the chance to start life with a home of their own at a cost they can afford, not spending long years in the hopeless cause of trying to save the money for the deposit on a house while paying rent which are rarely a fair percentage of their incomes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What about relieving these pressures on people with <span class="highlight">families</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, may I say that I do not believe that for people in need there is any new world dawning by giving large <span class="highlight">families</span> an extra $15 or so a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Women are assured that their brains will stagnate and that they are real no-hopers if they stay at home and bring up their <span class="highlight">families</span> in the time-honoured tradition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will bring substantial increases to the incomes of 300 000 low income familiesSenator Melzer wondered whether they existwith 800 000 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The old rebate system was of no help to these <span class="highlight">families</span> because their earnings were not high enough to take full advantage of the tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister has pointed out, the increases are really meaningful and will be of immense assistance to the low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be paid to single parent <span class="highlight">families</span> as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, their <span class="highlight">families</span> have suffered hardship through unemployment and erosion of income through inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the same degree of participation and co-operation be sought from these committees, volunteer groups of mothers and community workers who gave ungrudgingly a great deal of their free time to establish projects for working and non-working <span class="highlight">families</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed out that the Bill was primarily aimed at assisting low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, 300 000 of whom will benefit greatly from the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the chamber recognise that the Bill will make certain improvements in the financial situation of some very poor women and some very poor <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Poor women, particularly poor women with large <span class="highlight">families</span>, are still oppressed and powerless in this society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The majority of them drop out ofthe work force while they have their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as most working women have children and are therefore aware of the needs of <span class="highlight">families</span>, particularly poor <span class="highlight">families</span>, and are happy to support an increase in child endowment, so I think we should encourage women who are at present at home with their children to think in terms of supporting policies for women who need or wish to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was quite amazed last night to hear  Senator Baume,  speaking for the Government, claim that this Bill, which increases child endowment payments, represented some sort of radical program for a genuine redistribution of wealth throughout the community, that it was innovative and that nothing like this had ever been done for women or <span class="highlight">families</span> before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that my reference to those figures will prevent from being made yet again in the Senate the claim that somehow the high participation of mothers and married women in the work force was a phenomenon that came about only as a result of the Labor Government and somehow as a result of pressures put on <span class="highlight">families</span> by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is totally inaccurate to try to look at such a complex social change as the change in life style of married women and <span class="highlight">families</span> in terms of anything that might have happened during the  5  years of the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation of students on tertiary allowances, particularly students from poorer <span class="highlight">families</span> or middle income <span class="highlight">families</span>, is very grim at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard quite a lot of quotations from the relevant Henderson reports on poor <span class="highlight">families</span> and quite a lot of references to the fact that the Government now is adopting Professor Henderson’s recommendations in respect of child endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were a number of recommendations, of which that for increases in child endowment- that is, increases in cash payments to poor <span class="highlight">families</span>- was only one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding of the overall views of the Henderson report with respect to a guaranteed minimum income was that increased cash payments to <span class="highlight">families</span> by way of child endowment payments would be only one of the steps necessary to establish a guaranteed minimum income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While it is true that the Henderson report recommended increasing cash payments to <span class="highlight">families</span> I do not think the findings oppose the provision of services to poor <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will still be a need for the Government to pour a great deal of money into public services if the opportunities of poor <span class="highlight">families</span> are to be improved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Money alone will not improve the opportunities of poor <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Access to good education and good health care and the availability of reasonably priced housing will also improve, perhaps even more significantly improve, opportunities for poor <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think either the last  speaker  for the Government, or perhaps it was  Senator Baume  last night, said in conclusion that there would be many more measures to assist poor <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although we all acknowledge that an advance has been made in respect of child endowment payments, we on this side ofthe chamber recognise that it is a very small advance and that there are many more actions that a responsible government can take if it is genuine about improving opportunities in life for poor <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to provide assistance to poorer <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not do a great deal to support <span class="highlight">families</span> in general. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, many <span class="highlight">families</span> in the middle income groups will get absolutely nothing from the provisions of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Many <span class="highlight">families</span> in the middle income groups will not benefit from this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are thousands upon thousands of trade unionists who earn approximately the average weekly wage or above, and for many of those <span class="highlight">families</span> as a whole the provisions of this Bill will do absolutely nothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that she will not allow the situation regarding <span class="highlight">families</span> to rest with this Bill and that she will give consideration to the proposals that have been suggested for a mother’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do want to say that it is a proposal which has resulted from a review of the manner in which assistance has been given to <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is understood by everyone that, through the abolition of certain income tax rebates, we have been able to restructure the way in which assistance is now given to <span class="highlight">families</span> in the form of the new family allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were heavily influenced by the recommendations of the Henderson report, which showed that income given into the hands of <span class="highlight">families</span> would be of assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst at this time of somewhat economic stringency we have been unable to increase to any great degree the amount that is given, we have been able by abolishing a part of the income tax rebate to direct additional payments to those lower income <span class="highlight">families</span> and those single parent <span class="highlight">families</span> which otherwise would not have had the opportunity to receive increased payments at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Melzer spoke of the other benefits that are required to give assistance to <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it would be ungracious of anyone to state that the Government believes that this is the end result of what can be done to assist <span class="highlight">families</span> in the Australian context. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do want to take up the points that were made by  Senator Harradine  with regard to family allowances and the needs of <span class="highlight">families</span> as distinct from their wants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in calling our new assistance ‘family allowances’ we are talking about assistance that is able to be given to <span class="highlight">families</span> with children in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two major areas into which a number of these projects have a substantial input are the development of services relating to <span class="highlight">families</span> and social welfare manpower planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In reference to the former, wide ranging research is being conducted on family services in each State and the Territories, to ascertain current and future service needs of <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite many hardships and disappointments they have established themselves and their <span class="highlight">families</span> in the Territory on rural properties, isolated settlements and towns of great character and vitality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will destroy the souls of those farmers and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister also been asked to simplify forms of assistance for rural <span class="highlight">families</span> who have school children living away from home at hostels and boarding schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-69-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the deaths of  Mr Thomas  Louis Bull, O.B.E., a former senator for the State of New South Wales,  Mr William  Edward Aylett, a former senator for the State of Tasmania, and  Mr George  Irvine Whiteside, a former senator for the State of Queensland, and  Mr Laurence  John Failes, a former member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Lawson, New South Wales, places on record its appreciation of their long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to their <span class="highlight">families</span> in their bereavement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that all honourable senators will join with me, on behalf of the Government, in expressing our sympathy to the <span class="highlight">families</span> of former  Senator Bull,  former  Senator Whiteside,  former  Senator Aylett  and  Mr Failes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who knew Tom Bull knew the strength of his convictions and his concern for the welfare of his family and, indeed, of all <span class="highlight">families</span> in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I extend my sympathy also to the <span class="highlight">families</span> of the other former senators and of the member of the House of Representatives with whom this motion is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (2) The original proposal for a nursing post at Pantijan was based on the likely needs of an anticipated community population of 20 workers and <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present, only 15 itinerant workers, without <span class="highlight">families</span>, are at Pantijan and funding of the proposed nursing post has been deferred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that the Australian Postal Commission and the Australian Telecommunications Commission are now expected to be financially self-sufficient and to contribute to their own capital expansion, what safeguards can the Minister give that the interests of <span class="highlight">families</span> living in remote areas which would be patently unprofitable to service are being protected? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These examples indicate that both Commissions are responsive in a practical way to the special difficulties of <span class="highlight">families</span> in remote areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government acknowledge that many of the parents involved deserve at least some support and encouragement because they are willing to improve their own and their <span class="highlight">families</span>’ lives through hard work and initiative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is greatly appreciative of the problems of isolated <span class="highlight">families</span> with children, particularly <span class="highlight">families</span> such as those of cattle producers who are suffering doubly because of the dreadful fall in beef prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unemployment is wrecking marriages and splitting <span class="highlight">families</span> in the outer western suburbs, particularly Mt Druitt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The economic circumstances of <span class="highlight">families</span> are just about inseparable from many of the marriage break-ups that are brought to us, ‘  Mr Don  Harley said today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that if these recommendations are implemented they will go a long way towards giving assistance to parents of isolated children, parents who are endeavouring to give their <span class="highlight">families</span> the same educational opportunities as other children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No changes for the better have come about in the questions of free emigration and, particularly relating to the problem of uniting <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the activities of the Soviet Governments are inconsistent with their own explanation of the question concerning the unification of <span class="highlight">families</span>, since there are cases of refusal to emigrate to the members of <span class="highlight">families</span> who are recognised as such by the Soviet code relating to the marriage and family (see Document No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to stress that such unacceptable interpretation of the Final Act, to which authorities now relate, makes it impossible to affect an exit from the country for the Soviet citizens who wish to emigrate, not for the purposes of reuniting with their <span class="highlight">families</span>, but for religious, political, national, professional or other motives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conditions of the Helsinki Final Act, concerning particularly expeditious examination and satisfactory result of uniting <span class="highlight">families</span> with sick and old people, are completely ignored by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That reduction of the age limit from six years to eighteen months for patients eligible to receive cows’ milk substitutes as a pharmaceutical benefit under the schedules of the National Health Act will cause serious financial hardship to many <span class="highlight">families</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-15">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that at this period when we have many Australians dependent on welfare benefits we might start to consider very seriously the necessity for something like a guaranteed minimum income scheme for all individuals and <span class="highlight">families</span> in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are many women, who formerly had an opportunity to go out to work and support their <span class="highlight">families</span>, but now exist on the supporting mother’s benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are experiencing many difficulties in supporting their <span class="highlight">families</span> on that benefit and experiencing many difficulties in the administration of that benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the problem probably of greater importance is that our society in its post industrial phase has developed into one of nuclear <span class="highlight">families</span> where <span class="highlight">families</span> of 2 generations live in accommodation where there is neither the ability nor often the desire for immediate members of <span class="highlight">families</span>- for sons, daughters or anybody else- to care for the increasing numbers of aged persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Council has said that we should be looking at programs that would make it easy for people in this kind of housing- the Council has statistics; the numbers run into hundreds of thousands- to move into more appropriate and simpler housing which they can manage and at the same time get some benefit from giving up their own housing to give to society extra housing for <span class="highlight">families</span> which is needed at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that the Government has decided, as shown in the Budget Papers, to increase the price of a meal taken at a community kitchen on an Aboriginal reserve, will this deprive children of impoverished <span class="highlight">families</span> of the opportunity of partaking of a meal which they now receive? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only is the public treated in this way; with large scale stand-downs there is also a massive effect on fellow workers and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is also very important to low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and it has increased the confidence of those Australian consumers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Budget $75,000 is allotted for an examination of the establishment of a scheme which would provide a voucher system for individual low income <span class="highlight">families</span> so that they can search out their own housing, the housing which suits them best, rather than be forced by State government authorities and other authorities to accept housing which is not in their best interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The family allowances scheme, which has been well canvassed since 20 May, will bring benefit to 300 000 low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Martin  said, we have assisted through our new family allowance scheme those 300 000 low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, with their 800 000 children, who previously just did not have sufficient income to benefit from tax rebates for their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not the 300 000 <span class="highlight">families</span>, as the Treasurer keeps insisting, whose incomes were not high enough to take advantage of the dependant’s rebate scheme introduced in the Hayden Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That reduction of the age limit from six years to eighteen months for patients eligible to receive cows’ milk substitutes as a Pharmaceutical benefit under the schedules of the National Health Act will cause serious financial hardship to many <span class="highlight">families</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addressing my question to the Minister for Social Security I refer to representations made over a considerable period to the previous Government and the present Government, and to senators, by organisations seeking the alleviation of the hardships suffered by one-parent <span class="highlight">families</span>, including motherless <span class="highlight">families</span>, in Australia, with which problem I know the Minister is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For single parent <span class="highlight">families</span>, or <span class="highlight">families</span> where one parent is an invalid, we will introduce a special child care rebate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In response to the question I can say only that the Government is aware of the needs of one-parent <span class="highlight">families</span> for emergency funding, income and benefits including child care facilities and other supportive services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very difficult for <span class="highlight">families</span> like this ever to achieve what they started out to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is worth repeating that some 300 000 low income <span class="highlight">families</span> with 800 000 children will benefit most from the dependent children’s rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it might be useful for this country if the Labor Party, which is supposed to be the friend of the oppressed, came out and supported what is a most substantial reform in favour of 800 000 children in the community who are in relatively poor circumstances in the 300 000 <span class="highlight">families</span> which are in relatively poor circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is expected that the scheme will provide for about 300 peoplethat is workers and their <span class="highlight">families</span>- to move from the island each year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some 300 000 low income <span class="highlight">families</span> are assisted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is shown that 300 000 <span class="highlight">families</span> will benefit by this and 800 000 children are to be beneficiaries,  ls this  the type of reform which can be described as demolishing the social service system? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answer to the last part of the question with regard to <span class="highlight">families</span> who wish to have their payments made on a more frequent basis than 3- monthly, let me say that it is quite competent for <span class="highlight">families</span> to request that their allowances be paid on a monthly basis with a 4-weekly cheque that can be sent to them at their own address. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As with education facilities, medical assistance generally is concentrated in city or regional areas and thus Aboriginal people and their <span class="highlight">families</span> need to visit these centres to obtain health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, in order to take up job opportunities, single Aboriginal people and Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span> must often make such a move and since, under the circumstances, it often takes some time to find suitable accommodation, these Aboriginal people require opportunities to take up suitable forms of temporary accommodation at reasonable cost, in locations where such employment opportunities from time to time become available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To continue, it often happens that aged Aboriginal people, just like aged people in almost any country cannot always be cared for by their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or, again, just like anyone else, don’t like to feel that they are a burden on their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I may just repeat these points, temporary accommodation is needed to enable Aboriginal individuals and <span class="highlight">families</span> to move to new areas to take up opportunities in education, employment, rehabilitation and medical treatment or to travel for personal purposes while maintaining a decent standard of living at a price they can afford. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well, emergency temporary accommodation is also necessary for <span class="highlight">families</span> in crisis or transit until permanent housing can be found. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Transient Hostels cater for <span class="highlight">families</span> as well as individuals in transit, homeless or seeking employment or medical help and are of larger sizes depending upon the demand and the properties available at the time of acquisition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s decision to introduce a new system of family allowances paid to wives will provide a substantial increase in income for many Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span> and reduce the demands on some programs that were necessary for Aborigines in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Can the Minister for Social Security advise the Senate whether family allowances are in some cases payable to Australian citizens who, together with their <span class="highlight">families</span>, are temporarily overseas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How many Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span> have been housed in these dwellings for each of the past ten years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Low income earners with <span class="highlight">families</span> who through no fault of their own will not be able to afford to pay into a private fund will not be deprived under the present Government’s arrangements; they will be looked after. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that I will not be imposing on your leniency,  Mr President,  by saying that since the introduction of the family allowances I have had the opportunity of seeing the difference this has meant to many <span class="highlight">families</span> throughout my State of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I realise that the hour is late but I think the community has some interest in this issue because it will affect the income, the real take home pay, of every wage earner in the land and will impose a considerable burden on many <span class="highlight">families</span> in respect of the choice they will have to make. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was an extremely efficient procedure and it was extremely popular with the public and extremely welcome to low income earners or <span class="highlight">families</span> with a lot of children who had difficulties making on the spot cash payments which many private doctors demand these days and which, no doubt, they will demand even more now that they know every person will be insured and will be able to obtain a refund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will not now necessarily be a uniform cover because people will have different needs and will exercise their right to choose what they consider best suits them and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to draw the attention of the Senate to the Press release of the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  dated 16 September, in which the position as it will exist for those 2-income <span class="highlight">families</span> was clearly stated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our Government has seen fit to limit the levy’s upper limit to protect 2-income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As you know,  Mr President,  it is often the <span class="highlight">families</span> who are battlers who have two people working and who will be most appreciative of the levy ceiling which will ensure that from the combined income no more than $300 will have to be paid by way of health insurance levy if they wish to stay with Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The improved system of family allowance started from 1 July to benefit people with <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to the problem being experienced by Timorese corning to Australia, in many cases to be reunited with their <span class="highlight">families</span> in the eastern States of Australia, and also in Darwin, Northern Territory, where several hundred refugees are living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should mention here that the family allowance scheme, which is estimated to provide $16m directly to Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span>, is not regarded as a substitute for special Aboriginal programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Prime Minister pointed out to the House on 25 August the family allowance scheme involves funds which go directly to Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span> and gives them an independence and capacity to spend those funds as they believe best in their own interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 wonder how many <span class="highlight">families</span> earning less than $8,200 a year could live on that income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of the secondary allowance scheme to assist <span class="highlight">families</span> to keep children at high school the maximum allowance has been increased by only $100 whilst the maximum family income to attract the full allowance has been increased from $4,300 to only $5, 1 50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For 2 <span class="highlight">families</span> in every 100 the state of affairs is disastrous because the breadwinner is not able to earn the weekly income needed to sustain the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On the Australian Broadcasting Commission program  Lateline- or  the ‘Marxist halfhour’ as it is colloquially known- recently there was a statement by a radical feminist to the effect that there should be 2 -income <span class="highlight">families</span> and that the husband should go to work for 4 hours a day and the wife should go to work for 4 hours a day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report of the Presbyterian Church expressed its deep concern for these <span class="highlight">families</span> which evidence the pressures, privations and severe anxieties occasioned by the present crisis in rural industry and, in particular, in the dairying and beef industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I recently read in an article published by one of the major newspapers that there are still more people in Australia with 2 jobs than there are with none and 20 per cent to 25 per cent of these represent 3 job <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In such cases the benefit becomes an indirect subsidy sometimes to the <span class="highlight">families</span> involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The abolition of the income tax rebates for dependent children and the substitution of higher child endowment has removed the inequity arising from the inability of low income <span class="highlight">families</span> to take full advantage of the taxation rebates for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of that statement, can the Minister explain to the Senate and to the student community who are very interested in this matter why he has introduced a new category- ‘dependent student away from home’- with a maximum allowance of $38, or $5 a week less than the new ‘independent student’ maximum allowance of $43, when the <span class="highlight">families</span> of students qualifying for the maximum ‘dependent away from home’ allowance will already have been means tested quite rigidly? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761007_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the low income <span class="highlight">families</span> who are unlikely to be able to assist students in this category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761007_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister agree that this new discrepancy between independent students and dependent students from poor <span class="highlight">families</span> living away from home may force poorer students to delay their studies for 2 years while they acquire eligibility for the independent student’s allowance, either by working full time for 2 years or- as is more likely in the present circumstancesby spending 2 years on the dole? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761007_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the desirability of preserving and fostering contacts between <span class="highlight">families</span> overseas and their relatives here, some of whom they have never seen, such as young people born in this country, could there not be a relaxation of this requirement, which adds considerably to the costs of these presents and is damaging to the preservation of family contacts which are so important to these people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761014_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point that I was making- I am not the first to make it- was that some reparation ought to be made to the <span class="highlight">families</span> who were shattered by the unfortunate and tragic death of these 5 journalists, who were caught in a circumstance which perhaps arose from the political limbo in which we found ourselves at the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regrettably, since the Indonesians are not prepared to accept that they were in the area at the time, there appears to be no way in which justice can be sought and achieved for the <span class="highlight">families</span> of these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is not possible to achieve this end- that is, reparation for the <span class="highlight">families</span> concerned- perhaps the Government should take some steps to give special aid to these <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the correct thing to do would be to establish some amount of money which these <span class="highlight">families</span> should receive in reparation, accept that the Indonesians were responsible and then tell them that we will deduct from the amount of aid that we give to Indonesia an amount of money which we consider necessary to be paid to the <span class="highlight">families</span> of this group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me press the point that some assistance should be given to the <span class="highlight">families</span> beyond the ordinary compensation which has been paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The men were caught in a situation and apparently we cannot pin the blame where it belongs and seek justice for the <span class="highlight">families</span> of these men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what I am asking for here- some expression of humanity on the part of the Government in supporting the <span class="highlight">families</span> of these journalists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For example, they prevent the break-up of <span class="highlight">families</span> and the subsequent institutionalisation of <span class="highlight">families</span> which is, as the Minister and other honourable senators are aware, a very expensive process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I submit to the Senate that the provision of normal welfare type services, normal welfare type housing for <span class="highlight">families</span> in distress, homes for children and so on is a much more expensive operation than the subsidisation of women’s refuges for a few thousand dollars a year to enable them to provide the sort of assistance that they do provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reason why we left was because my family were kicked off in 1957 after we had some trouble there and a few other <span class="highlight">families</span> were also put off the Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have said, we were the first government to introduce child endowment and to help the poor <span class="highlight">families</span> with children and again we are the first government to introduce major reforms aimed primarily to benefit the lower income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the payment also goes to the working mother, at least it is a recognition that the mother needs some money of her own to spend on the priorities as she sees them and not only as the husband dictates as has often happened in many <span class="highlight">families</span> in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I sincerely hope that there are a lot of wage earners and very poor students from very poor <span class="highlight">families</span> who get the living allowance because if they are earning less than $1,600 a year they are entitled to the allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only alternative is to relocate and readjust the 400 workers, their <span class="highlight">families</span> and their dependants somewhere else in Tasmania or elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position is that the workers who are bound to go from Mount Lyell will find it very difficult to get a job and the Government will have to sustain them and their <span class="highlight">families</span> by paying the unemployment benefit and adjustment assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In short, the workers and their <span class="highlight">families</span>, instead of being strong contributors to the economy, will become a burden on the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I learnt the qualities of the people who seemed to gravitate to the mining areas and who found enjoyment, happiness and contentment in the sort of conditions that obtained there and who brought up their <span class="highlight">families</span> in those areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If 40 per cent of the employees of the mine are dismissed and have to go elsewhere the impact will be not only on those 400 people but also on their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One deals with it by considering factors which are designed to get money for the men who have to keep their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Mount Larcom incident concerned almost half a hundred farmers and their <span class="highlight">families</span>, who have been deprived of a living because of collusion between the Government of Queensland and a certain mining company which I have nominated previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the meantime the welfare and the livelihood of almost 50 <span class="highlight">families</span> are at stake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matters that startle me and which indicate that things are not what they should be must be investigated immediately by this Government before dozens of <span class="highlight">families</span> are wrongfully evicted from their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Maybe 50 farmers and their <span class="highlight">families</span> do not particularly concern the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That in 39.4 per cent of married couple <span class="highlight">families</span>, both parents work and of these 59 per cent have dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That would allow us to examine the matter without any question in the back of our minds that immediately, and even before the committee goes into action, 400 workers, their <span class="highlight">families</span> and other sections of the community will be affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There has been a decline in the number of houses allocated to <span class="highlight">families</span> in distress and a tightening up of guidelines which has meant that many <span class="highlight">families</span> in distress and seeking emergency housing have not been able to qualify for this housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the increase in revenue is not compensated for by the hardship caused to <span class="highlight">families</span> who, without much prior warning, and certainly with no prior warning by the coalition parties before the last general election, have to face these vast increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Similarly with interest rates there has been a drastic increase for a number of <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There would have been an increase for more <span class="highlight">families</span> if the Department had not backed down with respect to some mortgage agreements because the Public Service union- the Adminis.tative and Clerical Officers Association- threatened to take legal action on the grounds that the increase in certain mortgage agreements was illegal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, I would relate this to the Government’s general attitude to rental of housing and to interest rates which have been so high as to prohibit a number of <span class="highlight">families</span> who intended to build this year from being able to proceed with their intentions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In discussing the matter with the <span class="highlight">families</span> concerned, I put forward the view that perhaps it is due to the fact that new concepts are held by the medical staffs who currently argue that such people, as far as possible, ought to be accommodated in community environments and conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we take young people from their <span class="highlight">families</span>, a great cost to their race, and separate them from their <span class="highlight">families</span>, if we teach them to read and write and do not give them any means of living by those skills but send them back to a society in which those skills are not used but are forgotten we have somehow or other failed those people educationally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we look at these types of <span class="highlight">families</span> and see the nomadic life that many of them live, we realise that one of the problems that we face is that we are trying through building edifices to make those people fit into a physical structure which is quite foreign to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has taken a number of initiatives to assist home buyers and to promote home building: an improved Home Savings Grant scheme has been introduced to operate from 1 January 1977; an experiment is to be conducted with housing allowance vouchers to find out the best way of assisting low income renters in the private market; approximately 1500 <span class="highlight">families</span> are to be assisted in each of three cities- Hobart, Melbourne and Sydney, and this will ease the waiting list for Housing Commission homes; a revised housing loan interest deductibility scheme was introduced to give maximum assistance to first home buyers in the first five years of ownership; the level of welfare housing advances to the States was maintained in 1976-77 despite severe budgetary constraints. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly those in the rural communities who see <span class="highlight">families</span> leaving districts and who see <span class="highlight">families</span> leaving a particular industry must be concerned with the effects that that decline has upon the hopes and aspirations of the people within that particular region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Area Redevelopment Authorities be established in designated areas to co-ordinate and guide the changes taking place and to influence the rate at which they occur, for specified fruit or for horticultural production generally in areas subject to Area Redevelopment Authorities: a fruitgrowing adjustment counselling service be established to work intensively with individual farmers and their <span class="highlight">families</span>: concessional adjustment finance be provided to help farmers redevelop within agriculture or, where appropriate, to establish themselves outside it, on the following terms and conditions: finance from commercial sources is unavailable but the loan could be serviced; for the first three years of a concessional loan the rate of interest be 50 per cent of the long term bond rate; during these three years there will be capitalisation of interest at the concessional rate and a repayment holiday for at least that period; the upper limit for concessional loans be $20,000; and the viability of adjustment be demonstrable given those loan terms; assistance be provided for the removal of trees and vines which, if not properly maintained, could harbour diseases and pests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps my final comment should be that one of the big difficulties has been that in Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span>, including the extended family, there is no study orientation to impel the child from the home to school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are undertaking a considerable number of reforms in Aboriginal education, including the recruitment of Aboriginal teacher aides and the upgrading by in-service training of Aboriginal teachers and teacher aides, so that there will be a more direct link between the school and the <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one listened last night to  Senator Grimes  unfortunately I think one heard that unintentionally he was confusing the people of Australia when he said that the scheme is an experiment which will provide $70m over the next 3 years for only 1500 <span class="highlight">families</span> in 3 capital cities- Sydney, Melbourne and Hobart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He may not have intended it but he did give the impression that only 1500 <span class="highlight">families</span> were affected, not 4560 in all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Their <span class="highlight">families</span> faced the hardship of isolation and all the problems of a farmer trying to succeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This benefit was increased to realistic proportions only last year by this Government with the introduction of the family allowance scheme which was designed particularly to help low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, large <span class="highlight">families</span> and the <span class="highlight">families</span> of the unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was possible to discuss such matters as the amount of relaxation, the amount of exercise, the amount of smoking and drinking, the amount of time the executives managed to spend with their <span class="highlight">families</span> and the number of holidays- all things which might be a little threatening if we as politicians tried to examine our own performance in those areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The number of working couples has increased from between 250 000 and 300 000 in 4 years, on the best method of deduction that I could come up with on the working figures, until now over 50 per cent of <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia are 2-income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I did a quick calculation, and on the basis of 2 million 2-income <span class="highlight">families</span> and 350 000 unemployed, that solution would represent a tax of approximately  11 lA  per cent on the 2-income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is easy to point to increased income in the hands of Aborigines as the cause, yet I believe that many thoughtful people recognise that sometimes increased spending power simply leads to increasing the money that can be used for the abuse of alcohol to the detriment of Aborigines and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition the Government has not recognised Indonesia’s incorporation of East Timor although for practical reasons we have accepted some of the realities and the practical reasons are these: We believe it important that the suffering of the people of Timor be relieved; we believe it important that effective humanitarian aid and assistance be given; we believe that <span class="highlight">families</span> separated by the Timor troubles should be reunited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is important that the Government has been negotiating with Indonesia for the reunification of <span class="highlight">families</span> from East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>According to some reports there has been agreement in principle that this reunification of <span class="highlight">families</span> will go ahead and the Indonesian Government has indicated its agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think we have to note that any further strain in relations or perhaps a break in relations with Indonesia could end those negotiations and end hope of reunification of those <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia’s capacity to provide aid to East Timor, to assist refugees from East Timor and to reunite <span class="highlight">families</span> from East Timor unfortunately are not matters entirely under our control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I cannot support the proposal for a select committee or a reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence at this stage because I do not believe either would achieve certain things which I think are desirable- a proper act of self-determination, Australian aid to East Timor, assistance to refugees and the re-uniting of <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am aware that some low income <span class="highlight">families</span> are seriously disadvantaged by the additional expenses which they incur because they have a child who has a disability but who is not handicapped to the extent necessary to qualify for handicapped child’s allowance . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In terms of Government policy, particularly at a time of consideration of a Budget, I do not have the luxury of being able to speculate on Budget decisions or discussions, but I state again that I hold the view that there is a difficulty for low income <span class="highlight">families</span> which sustain considerable expense in caring for handicapped children who may not meet the strict medical criteria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think, again from memory, that we did have some breakdown on how many farmers that encompasses but one can appreciate in these times of inflation that $18,941 spread across the Commonwealth will not keep many people in the farming community and their <span class="highlight">families</span> alive for very long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Consistent with that and consistent with the establishment of the Tertiary Education Commission, the councils and the Schools Commission, desirably there should be discussions between the Commonwealth and the States to see how, in the spending of perhaps some $6,000m of taxpayers money, the Commonwealth and the States together can deliver a better system of education which will enable the clients- the students and the <span class="highlight">families</span>- to receive a better quality of education and which, at the same time, will allow us in that journey to remove whatever administrative conflicts, overlaps, duplications or wastages may occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When announcing the measures to replace tax rebates for children and students with increased family allowances in his comprehensive economic statement on 20 May 1976, the Treasurer said that one effect of the new system would be to bring about some redistribution of income within <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-134">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said this would mean that the takehome pay of many fathers would be reduced as a result of the withdrawal of the tax rebates, but that there would be no great effect on the overall position of <span class="highlight">families</span> who had been able to take full advantage of the rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-134">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On that occasion I pointed out how the restrictions in respect of those organisations are such that today they cannot do what they could do previously and how in South Australia it is possible to erect only some 47 homes under the Government allocation this year, whereas in the metropolitan district of Adelaide there are more than 520 applicant Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span> for homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In those areas where population is growing rapidly and where the pressure of new patterns of population- particularly of young <span class="highlight">families</span>- is felt most strongly, certainly one ought to be thankful that the non-government schools sector wants to move in and thereby to assist in relieving some of that pressure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Every attempt is being made to resolve the situation but it does require the co-operation of the Aboriginal people themselves and I can see no gain in attracting whole <span class="highlight">families</span> across the width of Australia in an attempt to force my hand over matters of which I have little or no control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Added to that, the nursing home lobby is ever-willing to use emotional arguments, to use their patients and the feelings of insecurity of their patients’ <span class="highlight">families</span>, to pressure this and all other governments, including the previous Labor Government, to provide support for their enterprises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In this legislation the Government is making an attempt through the new Medibank system to close the gap for patients and their <span class="highlight">families</span>, and I do not decry that effort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every member of this Parliament receives representations during every year, when fees go up and the burden on patients and their <span class="highlight">families</span> increases, to do something about this gap that arises between the fees and the subsidies and in the future, I suggest, between the fees and the benefits that will be payable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, the people who opt for hospital only insurance and the <span class="highlight">families</span> which pay the Medibank levy plus $135 a year payment for hospital only insurance are subsidised, we are told, by about $50 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Minister has now widened eligibility for the handicapped children’s allowance to assist low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, does she envisage this extending to <span class="highlight">families</span> like the Dremmel family which has children with heart troubles, asthma and other physical problems? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Evidence from both lone fathers and children’s homes indicates that the lack of options open to lone fathers can mean that these <span class="highlight">families</span> break up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Much was said during that debate about unemployment amongst youth, about unemployment generally and about the plight of <span class="highlight">families</span> who have had their livelihood taken from them because of the ineptness, the prejudices and the failures of the Fraser Government and the Lynch economic strategies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet, if we look at what has happened to women in our community who have exercised the choice to be part of the work force, who have shown the incentive to go out to work for the improvement of their <span class="highlight">families</span> or for thenself fulfilment, who have had the motivation to be constructive and energetic about their community and about their <span class="highlight">families</span>, we find that the Government has totally ignored what has happened to them when they face unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happened in the meantime was that many of these <span class="highlight">families</span>, particularly migrant <span class="highlight">families</span> who came to Australia to establish themselves, to get themselves a home- which perhaps was one of their main objectives in leaving the country of their birth- during the period of the 1950s and 1960s committed themselves to large mortgage repayments and to education expenses for their children and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me that the plight of unemployed married women, whose <span class="highlight">families</span> are dependent on their incomes, is at least as serious as the plight of unemployed school leavers and for that group of unemployed no schemes have been proffered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Has the Minister for Social Security seen the figures on the poverty line which were released yesterday, I understand, by Professor Henderson, and in particular the claim that many large <span class="highlight">families</span> are now falling even further below the poverty line, although the breadwinner is an income earner, and also that large <span class="highlight">families</span> with children are badly affected? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The answer to that proposition is that the new arrangements for assisting <span class="highlight">families</span> were introduced by the Government in order to direct more support to <span class="highlight">families</span> in most need, namely those with insufficient taxable income and therefore insufficient gross tax liabilities to take full advantage ofthe former tax rebates for dependants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The net cost to the 1976-77 Budget ofthe new arrangements was $100m and all this additional expenditure has been directed to the benefit of those <span class="highlight">families</span> in most need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Due to the lack of data on supporting fathers- their number, the size of their <span class="highlight">families</span>, their income distribution- and a lack of knowledge as to the number likely to seek assistance and the period for which they would seek it, it is not possible to estimate the exact cost of paying supporting fathers the same benefits that are available to supporting mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we do not, it could mean the disruption of the lives of the people on the west coast of Tasmania, people whose life savings are invested in their homes and properties, in an area in which many generations of their <span class="highlight">families</span> have grown up, an area in which they find comfort and in which they are happy to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But this is a great financial burden to the lower income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this benefit will be a great asset to these low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has it considered what will happen to those low income <span class="highlight">families</span> which have a lot of children to support- perhaps there is sickness in the family- and which need to send their teenagers out into the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What will be the social cost of depriving those <span class="highlight">families</span> of the assistance which they reasonably might have expected from their teenage children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it seems that whatever time of the year students leave school they will be forced to take the sui week’s vacation before they will be eligible to receive the unemployment benefit even if their specific reason for leaving school before the end of the year was to give financial support to their <span class="highlight">families</span> or because their <span class="highlight">families</span> could no longer support them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the withdrawal of this benefit, low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, such as migrant <span class="highlight">families</span> where both partners have to go out to work, will be hit very hard indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the Government is going to save very little by this new provision- perhaps half a million dollars; it is hard to assess- but thousands of <span class="highlight">families</span> might be reduced to poverty as a result of the loss of eligibility, particularly in the case where working wives of sick husbands have to give up work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sometimes wonder what Government senators know about working <span class="highlight">families</span> and their incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, not all those wage earners had <span class="highlight">families</span> to support; some of the them were part time workers and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation being created by the new provisions being introduced by the Fraser Government will affect most low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said before, it comes as no surprise to me that these figures are a novelty to him because I do not think he or any of his colleagues interest themselves in what happens to low income <span class="highlight">families</span> in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So approximately 1,000,000 women would represent dual income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I was pleased to have the opportunity to draw the attention of some honourable senators at least to the very difficult circumstances facing low income <span class="highlight">families</span> in our communitydifficult circumstances which the new provision with regard to sickness benefit will do nothing whatsoever to alleviate and in future cases will do a great deal to worsen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people are born of working <span class="highlight">families</span> which have had no opportunity to provide them with a higher education to fit them for a job which would bring in a high income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an emergency proposal which cannot be regarded as anything other than an effort to keep unemployed <span class="highlight">families</span> fed ‘,  Mr Payne  said last night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Otherwise, it will be a very bleak Christmas indeed for many hundreds of thousands of men, women and children, because parents do not have a fulltime job and cannot provide for their <span class="highlight">families</span> the most meagre Christmas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, the special benefit provision can be used by people who are in necessitous circumstances, although it must be understood that the special benefit is not an alternative to another Commonwealth benefit but one that is used as an emergency payment to people who have no other resources for themselves and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allowance was to be paid to <span class="highlight">families</span> who cared for handicapped children in their own homes as an alternative to institutional care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The expenditure which is occasioned by <span class="highlight">families</span> is something which should have some support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When their children leave school they frequently need to get a job to help support themselves and their <span class="highlight">families</span> but they cannot get jobs under the present circumstances although they are available for work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding that, we are placing a further burden on low income <span class="highlight">families</span> in rural areas by introducing a provision such as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact that primarily the reason for this trend was the incapacity of the non-government sector to meet the ordinary demands of the <span class="highlight">families</span> concerned, particularly in new growth areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over recent years members of the general public have decided, by their own decision-making, that universities are not necessarily preferable to either colleges or technical and further education institutions for the students in their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been some alteration of the priorities of preference of <span class="highlight">families</span> and therefore a voluntary reduction in the number of applications to universities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the family allowance was introduced the husband in well regulated <span class="highlight">families</span> used to budget and allocate so much out of his pay packet to the wife and mother on which she had to run the household. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main reason for abolishing tax rebates and introducing family allowances for dependent children and students was a redirect assistance towards <span class="highlight">families</span> most in need, namely those with insufficient taxable income, and therefore insufficient gross tax liabilities, to take full advantage of the former tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The benefits under the new arrangements for large <span class="highlight">families</span> with low incomes are substantial and such <span class="highlight">families</span> are better off in 1977-78 than they would have been under the previous system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I wish all honourable senators and their <span class="highlight">families</span> a very happy Christmas and a prosperous New Year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As explained in my answer to  Senator Grimes  in the Senate on 6 October 1977, special benefit has never been used as an income supplement for wage earning <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister: How much compensation, other than a trust fund for the children, will the <span class="highlight">families</span> of the three men, two employees of the Sydney City Council and members of the Municipal Employees Union, and a member of the New South Wales Police Force, killed in the Hilton Hotel bombing incident receive? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, will the Minister explain the apparent contradiction whereby shopkeepers who lost trade as a direct result of the security arrangements for the conference will be paid full indemnity while three <span class="highlight">families</span> who lost providers will not be compensated for loss of future income or the emotional stress caused by the violent deaths of the men concerned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of Social Security has had to employ field officers to check on the recipients of the unemployment benefit because many receiving the unemployment benefit would like to abuse the system- a system set up just 32 years ago to protect the unemployed and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely those gentlemen and the groups who support them and who are so concerned about the people on whom ASIO have files, should spare a little thought for the three men who were killed- for their rights and for their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Emotional stress is imposed on <span class="highlight">families</span> when there is not enough income to employ a son whose property the farm would ultimately become. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has literally broken <span class="highlight">families</span> and forced them away from their holdings and their properties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They could be members of our own <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Government will continue to press for proper decisions in regard to the reunion of Timorese <span class="highlight">families</span> in this country, and there are many of them, and that would be seen as an improvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where are the united <span class="highlight">families</span> which were used by several honourable senators last year as an excuse for voting against the proposal to hold an inquiry into East Timor? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, he did get into trouble with his family trust, but he does not have as much financial trouble as have many of these <span class="highlight">families</span> in Mannum who have been existing on benefits provided under the State Unemployment Relief scheme instituted by the Dunstan Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reality is that the women who work have to work so that their <span class="highlight">families</span> may survive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To maintain the economic and social needs of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>, <span class="highlight">families</span> need two incomes and one of those income earners is a female. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time 323,300 unmarried women- women who had never married, were widowed, divorced or permanently separated- were heads of <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That figure did not include the women who had sick or alcoholic husbands and spent their lives maintaining their husbands and <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures at that time showed that in Australia 36 per cent of <span class="highlight">families</span> had one income while 42 per cent of <span class="highlight">families</span> had two incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will look to alleviate the difficulties <span class="highlight">families</span> endure when the wife loses her job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is good economy and essential for effective social services to have <span class="highlight">families</span> fully involved and for a family to be regarded as the basic unit of society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the argument I am putting is that if we were to support women in the home this situation might not arise- <span class="highlight">families</span> might stay together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most are working to improve the quality of life of their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus it is not long before those <span class="highlight">families</span> feel the full financial blow of unemployment, and quite often the children suffer because of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if no more people were unemployed, some of those 445,300 have <span class="highlight">families</span> to support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are more than 29 <span class="highlight">families</span> involved who are working in the beef industry in this developing area of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a small school at Abercorn and the risk of losing those <span class="highlight">families</span> is that the school will have to close and the children from that school will have to travel by bus to Mulgildie, which is rather further than they have to travel to Abercorn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">families</span> in the beef-raising areas of Queensland, certainly parents in this area who have a fairly young family, cannot afford to send their children to boarding school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I expressed my concern that the rural areas are the hardest hit but in some cases it is necessary for men, with <span class="highlight">families</span> grown up and in need of employment, to determine whether it is of more benefit to them to leave their homes, their friends, and their work in the hope that their children may get employment in a larger town or in the city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a great strain on the <span class="highlight">families</span> of shift workers and a high breakdown of marriages, in contrast to <span class="highlight">families</span> of workers who work from nine to five, five days a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their <span class="highlight">families</span> are off their hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would pass on their shares and investments to their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime, there is the effect that this will have on the <span class="highlight">families</span> of the hundreds of thousands of Australians who will be unemployed and on probably thousands of small businesses which will go out of business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may even be the firm for which they or their <span class="highlight">families</span> work that we are trying to save. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Adelaide also had the highest home ownership among working <span class="highlight">families</span> earning less than $200 a week in 1974-75, with 70.8 per cent of such <span class="highlight">families</span> in Adelaide either owning outright or purchasing their dwellings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One need only look at, for example, the pressure on mothers to go out to work, and the discrimination felt by single income <span class="highlight">families</span> in relation to taxation, et cetera. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem cannot be solved by discriminating against married women in the work force, as some have suggested; rather, the solution lies in Government financial measures which will recognise the economic worth of the homemaker, contribution to family support programs and thus reverse the economic discrimination now experienced by single income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the answer is yes, does it mean that the pleas of many Latin American <span class="highlight">families</span> here whose relatives are subject to the dictates of military juntas in Latin America have been forgotten? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The sorts of situations which exist are simply these: Many of these <span class="highlight">families</span> have husbands and fathers in Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some six weeks ago, in announcing the de facto recognition of the Indonesian regime in Timor,  Mr Peacock,  the Minister for Foreign Affairs, again raised this question of the possibility of speeding up the reunification of Timorese refugee <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia with their husbands, fathers and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>ACFOA believes that the continual lack of action regarding the reuniting of <span class="highlight">families</span> from East Timor, separated since the latter part of 1975, is causing emotional hardship and possible long term psychological damage both to those who are already here and those separated from them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many Timorese refugee <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia, therefore, are suffering by having rip head of family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They belong to broken <span class="highlight">families</span> in many respects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are people who see no way clear to repair the damage to <span class="highlight">families</span> which they are suffering at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at the same time they realise that they have grave social problems, terrible problems, because of the failure to achieve any reunion of <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Timor among our close relations, we find our husbands, sons, parents, brothers, and other <span class="highlight">families</span> still suffering the anguish and horrors of a cruel war that has sown death and destruction among our people, respecting neither age, nor sex, family ties, nor friendships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently we desire that our <span class="highlight">families</span> joint us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, the real problem is the reunion of <span class="highlight">families</span> and that is what is worrying the people more than anything. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are concentrating therefore on getting their husbands and other members of their <span class="highlight">families</span> back with them as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They see a drift, a lack of action on the part of the Australian Government that has not yet achieved any substantial reunification of their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘<span class="highlight">families</span>’ should be widely interpreted in the terms of the culture and background of the refugees concerned rather than according to the normal criteria of Australian immigration procedures- this would involve the acceptance, appropriate to each particular ethnic group, of degrees of what we might describe as extended <span class="highlight">families</span> ‘; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>at the beginning of a refugee movement to Australia every effort should be made to keep <span class="highlight">families</span> together wherever possible; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told of places where the Department has been unhelpful, where it has had to make inquiries overseas in Hong Kong and other places and it has told people overseas to give information about the residents who are here so that they could reunite <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We may well feel that sufficient pressure has not been applied by the Australian Government to ensure that in the name of humanity something is done about these broken <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Government will continue to press for proper decisions in regard to the reunion of Timorese <span class="highlight">families</span> in this country, and there are many of them, and that would be seen as an improvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our responsibility as I see it is, firstly, urgent and effective pressure from Australia for the acceptance by Indonesia of an Australian immigration team in Timor and the achievement of early reunion of <span class="highlight">families</span> from there; secondly, for a more compassionate re-examination of the Portugal refugee program and the bringing from Portugal of many more of the people who are there at the moment and who want to come to Australia; thirdly, pressure for International Red Cross to get back into Timor and also for us to supply aid to these <span class="highlight">families</span> in Timor; and lastly, support for the Timorese leadership financially in Australia in the way that has been referred to by both  Senator Button  and me so that we will help the people who are here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government also agreed in principle to a visit to Australia by an Indonesian team to consider applications by any Timorese persons who wished to be reunited in East Timor with their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government had very much in mind the distress occasioned by separation of <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, how have they been changed and how many <span class="highlight">families</span> will be affected by these changes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People are again able to bring back discipline into their <span class="highlight">families</span> where there have been slight problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a lack of information about levels of, use of and expenditures on, health services among <span class="highlight">families</span> with different characteristics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable senators I present a report entitled ‘<span class="highlight">Families</span> and Social Services in Australia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This report devotes much of its content to an examination of the characteristics of <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia, noting the demographic statistics and trends, the high proportion of one-parent <span class="highlight">families</span> and the high proportion also of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> who come from a variety of cultural backgrounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aspects of the report discuss the needs of <span class="highlight">families</span> for assistance during the phases of family development through to the point at which children leave home and the family comprises adult members only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report concludes by making some recommendations about possible changes in approaches to providing services for <span class="highlight">families</span>, both in respect of Commonwealth activities and in respect of the serviceproviders at State and community level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe this is an important report, not least because of its attention to the needs of <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia today and to the extent to which government and community agencies can assist in meeting those needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ministers agreed that they would sponsor regular national conferences on <span class="highlight">families</span> and social welfare services in Australia, and the first of these is now in planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has meant that <span class="highlight">families</span> and individuals in need of emergency housing must wait for three weeks before they can obtain an interview, let alone a house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a way of providing houses, for example, to <span class="highlight">families</span> who have been evicted from their previous accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a 3-year funding program through the Office of Child Care to provide funds for voluntary community organisations which are engaged in activities of support to <span class="highlight">families</span> such as family counselling, financial counselling, advisory services, and services relating to ethnic groups, Aborigines and lone parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As members of parliament we should be prepared to take that risk in the interests of freedom of access into this place for ourselves, our <span class="highlight">families</span> and our constituents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware of the mental anguish, known locally as ‘millipediosis’, caused to <span class="highlight">families</span>, and particularly to housewives, each morning when they face a clean-up operation involving collecting buckets full of black insects which are found on walls, ceilings, floors and furniture, wardrobes, curtains and linen stores as well as in babies’ ears and nappies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say that the Indonesian Government has agreed, following the presidential election, that an immigration team should go to East Timor to obtain the reunification of <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia made representations to Indonesia and endeavoured for humanitarian reasons to reunite the 2600 Timorese in this country with their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would rather bring their relations and <span class="highlight">families</span> to Australia to be reunited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not heard a word from Opposition senators about reuniting <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, following the presidential elections that took place a little while ago, Indonesia says that it is ready to renegotiate an arrangement concerning the reuniting of these <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have tried and to some extent have succeeded in having aid sent to the East Timorese and we have sought above all the reunification of East Timorese <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been suggested that almost the same number of people want to come to Australia to be reunited with their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Families</span> have been broken up; they wish to be re-united. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be well imagined what a break in relations with Indonesia might mean to Australia and to the East Timorese people who are in this country now and who want to be reunified with their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only today there have been Press reports stating that the Indonesian Government, because the Australian Government has accorded de facto recognition to its control of East Timor, is prepared to re-open negotiations on the reunification of East Timorese <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were hoping that by continuing pressure we might be able to have the Indonesian Government concede something in relation to the reunification of <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We now find that because of the action we have taken it has agreed to open negotiations on the reunification of <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because we have shown to the Indonesians that we accept a fact- it is nothing more than the acceptance of an indisputable fact- the Indonesian Government is now prepared to reopen the way to the reunification of <span class="highlight">families</span> and the ending of their distress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were 2,000-odd Timorese refugees in Australia and some 1,500 other people in East Timor and in Portugal who wanted to come to Australia for the purpose of reuniting with their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been reiterated that the Government will arrange a visit to East Timor in connection with this question of the reunion of Timorese <span class="highlight">families</span>, but nothing has happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Several <span class="highlight">families</span> who have tribal relationships to the land are living at Peret, Ti-Tree and on the north and south banks of the Kendall River. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One advantage that can be seen by some of these <span class="highlight">families</span> of living out on their own land is that inter-family tensions at Aurukun seem to be much reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is now almost one and a half years after Cyclone Ted yet whole <span class="highlight">families</span> are still living in tattered tents and in make-shift humpies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has found that its <span class="highlight">families</span> have become divided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Perhaps they are <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But we had a situation in which large <span class="highlight">families</span> of Aborigines camped on station properties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They could no longer afford to pay some of the wages to some of the men and tucker the <span class="highlight">families</span> at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They were not told who their fathers were and who their mothers were, not told where they came from and were denied all knowledge of their forebears and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it had not been for the care and love of their Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span> who made sure that they knew where they came from and what they were, they would have had no beginnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following the answer given to  Senator Melzer  yesterday on the transfer of Public Service staff to Canberra, can the Minister advise, or would he have the Minister whom he represents ascertain, whether the National Capital Development Commission or the Department of the Capital Territory have estimated the total population increase likely in the Australian Capital Territory in 1978-79 as a result of the 500 transfers mentioned, and based on normal projections for the transferees, their immediate <span class="highlight">families</span> and the normal ancillary back-up provisions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The number of students involved, plus the staff, their <span class="highlight">families</span> and all the ancillary services, will lift the economy of the area and the fares, accommodation and general funding will be of some significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and/or the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and refers to the proposals put up by the Australian Government to Indonesia in respect of reuniting East Timorese <span class="highlight">families</span> following the occupation of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I understand the situation, the negotiations that have been conducted by our Foreign Affairs people in Jakarta towards the implementation of reunions of East Timorese <span class="highlight">families</span> are proceeding smoothly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of this move, has the Minister any further information regarding the present situation of Timor refugees in Australia being permitted to reunite with their <span class="highlight">families</span> still in Timor? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It must be doubly hard for the <span class="highlight">families</span> of the great, and of public figures, to suffer sorrow, because the one they have lost becomes such public property and almost seems to be taken away from them and their grief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780523_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They can take the species quite deliberately and claim they were taken non-commercially because they are used as food for the crews or the <span class="highlight">families</span> of the crews. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The membership of this Sub-Committee allows an input into an extensive community network and includes representatives who have an understanding of the service requirements of high need <span class="highlight">families</span> in the Australian Capital Territory including migrant <span class="highlight">families</span>, <span class="highlight">families</span> with handicapped children or parents, and single parent <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In correspondence to the States, the Commonwealth indicated that it wished to give greater emphasis in the future to the provision of child care for the children of needy <span class="highlight">families</span> and that it would be necessary to renegotiate the funding base in relation to pre-school funding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I do so, I ask: What action would this Government or any other government take to secure an industry that engaged 700 employees directly or 7,000 employees directly and indirectly and supported their  <span class="highlight">families</span>, and  an industry that would utilise an asset of $2,000m and produce overseas funds estimated to amount to nearly $ 1 billion? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not just direct employees but <span class="highlight">families</span> as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All of those countries, in one permutation or combination of death duties or a capital gains tax or a net wealth tax, make some provision whereby capital cannot accumulate into the hands of <span class="highlight">families</span> at the expense of the rest of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because, as he put it in his policy speech, estate duty has caused distress and hardship to thousands of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>, to small businesses and to farmers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within only a few generations we would find examples in Australia of the situation that exists in some European countries where some <span class="highlight">families</span> have a massive accumulation of wealth and a multitude of <span class="highlight">families</span> have very little. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, in Melbourne in the 1890s vast fortunes were acquired by defrauding depositors in so-called land banks established by, among others, the Baillieu and Fraser <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The other thing that concerns me about the CHOGRM conference, considering the very generous compensation payments that were made to businesses affected by the Hilton bombing incident, was the fact that no ex-gratia payments were made to the <span class="highlight">families</span> of the bomb victims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) How much compensation, other than a trust fund for the children, will the <span class="highlight">families</span> of the three men- two employees of the Sydney City Council who were members of the Municipal Employees ‘ Union, and a member of the New South Wales police force- killed in the Hilton Hotel bombing incident receive? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister explain the apparent contradiction whereby shopkeepers who lost trade as a direct result of the security arrangements for the Conference will be paid full indemnity while three <span class="highlight">families</span> who lost providers will not be compensated for the loss of future income nor for the emotional stress caused by the violent deaths of the men concerned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was told that State workers compensation legislation applies to the <span class="highlight">families</span> involved and that the Government was setting up a trust” fund for the education of the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Nothing could more graphically illustrate how out of touch  Senator Ryan  and the Australian Labor Party are with the overwhelming volume of students and their <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia than the question that has just been asked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, this is an innovation and, in defence of it, it should be said that there is a tendency now for younger people to enter parliamentary life and because they are younger they have younger <span class="highlight">families</span> and more direct family responsibilities than do older members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude the remarks for the Government on the second reading debate by saying that it is believed that this superannuation scheme will give protection to the <span class="highlight">families</span> of those who serve in the Commonwealth Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was said by  Senator Wright  that the provisions give a great privilege to <span class="highlight">families</span> of those who serve in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a contrast to that, many sacrifices are made by familiessometimes ultimate sacrifice- because of the burden of the responsibilities that are accepted which results in long absences from home and pre-occupation with matters that are regarded as national responsiblities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if weight is given to the sacrifices that are made by <span class="highlight">families</span> no one would argue that any privileges or benefits are out of balance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that government should encourage the arts and should encourage the giving of gifts so that substantial gifts held by <span class="highlight">families</span> can be made available for public viewing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have suggested to them previously that they ought to look at the possibility of allowing <span class="highlight">families</span> to be taxed on the basis of a family partnership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view, if the Government allowed <span class="highlight">families</span> to average their income the nonsense about the creation of family partnerships, family trusts and family companies, which all are designed to spread income among husband, wife and children, would no longer continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Family trusts are designed to keep the <span class="highlight">families</span> assets together, yes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be so in large capital enterprises, carried on by companies such as Amatil, or large <span class="highlight">families</span> that have amassed fortunes, millions; but the idea of creating family trusts, for whom trustees carry on the business and profits flow to the beneficiaries, has gone into the metropolis and has corroded and corrupted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Health has decided that to avoid hardship to low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, Aboriginal and ethnic <span class="highlight">families</span>, Aboriginal medical services and community health centres, bulk billing will remain until satisfactory alternative administrative arrangements are made to replace bulk billing for all but pensioner patients and their dependants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the one way that Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> can become ‘little capitalists’ and can accrue some property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fundamental point is that if we are to provide a home ownership scheme which is available to all <span class="highlight">families</span> two things must follow: The first is that interest rates and the inflation rate must decline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I said that the cheque generally would be sent to the patient, the Government has under consideration whether it would need to adopt some procedure to assist low income <span class="highlight">families</span> or special groups of people who may need to have the cheque sent to the doctor in full settlement of the account so they would not be harrassed When I said that in general the cheque would be forwarded to the patient, that is what I had in mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With tens of thousands of <span class="highlight">families</span> on the waiting list for housing commission homes and with the shortage of fundsand there is evidence that the amount of lending by the building authorities is only keeping up with the rate of inflation- it is evident that the problem is not one merely of lack of nominal demand, at least not in the housing sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It also means that <span class="highlight">families</span> cannot borrow on hire purchase for their cars as cheaply as they might otherwise do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, this is a major factor in the decision-making process of <span class="highlight">families</span> as to whether or not they spend more money on white goods, household appliances, furniture, housing, or whatever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a very significant figure in assessing the possible ability of <span class="highlight">families</span> to increase their personal expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem cannot be solved by discriminating against married women in the work force, as some have suggested but rather by implementing the Government’s financial measures which will recognise the economic worth of the homemaker and contribute to family support programs, thus reversing the economic discrimination now experienced by single income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister would also be aware of the concern of a large number of members of the Parliament about the pressures that are currently on <span class="highlight">families</span> in today’s modern society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to the announcement made by the Acting Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr Ellicott,  on 27 July 1978 that the Indonesian and Australian governments had made arrangements for the reunion of Timorese <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was this arrangement intended to cover Timorese <span class="highlight">families</span> being reunited in Australia as well as in East Timor? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware of the newsletters, numbered 14/78 and 16/78, printed in June-July 1978 by the Indonesian Embassy in Canberra- copies of which I have supplied to the Minister- which discuss the reunion of <span class="highlight">families</span> only in the context of repatriating the Timorese currently living in Australia and in other countries back to Timor? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister concerned that the Indonesian Government appears to be refusing to give public recognition to the possibility of Timorese leaving East Timor to be reunited with their <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister take action to ensure that the initial agreement of the two-way reunion of <span class="highlight">families</span> is honoured by the Indonesian Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand from the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs that the agreement reached in Jakarta during the talks between Australian and Indonesian officials provided for an exchange of immigration teams to reunite <span class="highlight">families</span> in either Australia or Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is expected that <span class="highlight">families</span> from Timor will join their relatives in Australia by Christmas time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister asked that I give the assurance that the outcome of the Jakarta talks as reflected in the agreed statement and in the agreed record of the meeting indicates the degree of co-operation given by the Indonesian authorities in seeking to reunite Timorese <span class="highlight">families</span> whether in Australia or Timor, depending upon the wishes of the people themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of these reports, does the Government intend to take action to bring immediate relief for these people by providing much needed medical supplies, by assisting in the rehabilitation of East Timor and by the reuniting of so many Timorese <span class="highlight">families</span> which have been fragmented by the Indonesian intrusion? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian and Indonesian officials met in Jakarta on 25 and 26 July to make arrangements for the reunion of East Timorese <span class="highlight">families</span> in East Timor and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that even though such a surplus exists the South Australian Housing Trust is still having difficulties in obtaining suitable rental housing for low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and that it contemplates the possibility of erecting more houses in this category? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would it be to the advantage of the State, the builders, as well as the consumers, for the South Australian Housing Trust to consider the lease of existing apartments or housing for rental to low income <span class="highlight">families</span> on a subsidised basis rather than to invest more capital in new building? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The project has involved a series of studies and surveys directed towards understanding and documenting <span class="highlight">families</span> that are at risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Information from that survey has now become available to the family research unit and it will publish ‘<span class="highlight">Families</span> in Australia- A Profile’ in November of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two further volumes on  <span class="highlight">Families</span> in Australia ‘ which will provide a fuller analysis of the survey data and include the implications of the findings of the study for social policy purposes will be published in 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The new health insurance arrangements will assist <span class="highlight">families</span> in meeting the extra costs which arise from the impact of this type of increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are the <span class="highlight">families</span> and relatives of political detainees in Singapore, many of whom have been detained without trial for 10 to IS years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1977, the ventilators in the cells in Moon Crescent Centre were closed, thus further aggravating the already poor ventilation of the cells and causing further physical and psychological stress to the detainees and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent months, severe curtailment has even been imposed on food stuff supplied by <span class="highlight">families</span> of political detainees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The prison diet for political detainees is inadequate and political detainees are compelled to supplement their diet with foodstuff from their <span class="highlight">families</span> to ensure their health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus the government has not only refused to improve detainees’ prison rations (which are in some respects worse that that for convicted prisoners), it has also seen fit to prevent detainees’ <span class="highlight">families</span> from adequately supplementing the prison diet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since April this year, the political detainees have been protesting against these persecutionary measures, staging sitdown protests after each visit because prison authorities have refused to discuss the issue of foodstuff brought in by the <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Is the Minister for Education not concerned at implications to Australian research programs of provisions in the 1978 Budget which would reduce payments to Commonwealth research grant scholars with <span class="highlight">families</span> to little more than what a man with similar family responsibilities would receive on the dole? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The social implications of the unemployment that we have now are frightening, not only for young people who have been preparing to enter the work force for many years only to find that they cannot obtain work but also for the people who have <span class="highlight">families</span> to support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have observed it, the Liberal Party’s grass roots support comes from hardworking, cheerful and enterprising people, both in the cities and in the country, who have in their <span class="highlight">families</span> and in their work place set themselves goals and worked hard to go on towards reaching them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The low income <span class="highlight">families</span> so dependent on them have suffered a loss in real income and those pensioners with children and pensioners with rented accommodation who have not had their children’s allowances or rent allowances increased since 1975 are now well below the poverty line, as pointed out by Professor Henderson who conducted the poverty inquiry and by almost every welfare agency in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It showed that <span class="highlight">families</span> with children which had one bread winner earning an income on or below average weekly earnings were up to $ 1 1 a week worse off as a result of the present Government’s tax policies and family allowance changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a totally unexpected attackonthemostseverelydisadvantaged people in our community through the decision to cut back the indexation of age pensions from a six-month to a 12-month frequency; by imposing new tax burdens on other recipients of social security pensions; by taxing family allowances through the mechanism of taxing children’s incomes; by abolishing the maternity allowance, which was a very minor form of assistance to <span class="highlight">families</span>; by imposing a totally inequitable form of increased taxation through indirect taxes which, of course, fall more heavily on the poor than on the rich; and by failing entirely to raise new and proper sources of revenue from the very rich and fruitful enterprises which are carried out in the minerals and energy sector of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How many hundreds and thousands of women and children who have got into difficulties through the problems associated with nuclear <span class="highlight">families</span> in this country, who have become split away from the nuclear family, and who have had nowhere to go, have been helped by women’s shelters in the various States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At present there is no way that <span class="highlight">families</span> of brain injured children can get any assistance from the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That expenditure is just not possible for most of the <span class="highlight">families</span> who have children who need this kind of attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that the Government have a look at this matter and under the health scheme or in some other way provide financial assistance for <span class="highlight">families</span> with children who suffer these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These pressures are not always just to do with the available support services in the community; they are pressures which are rooted as well in <span class="highlight">families</span>, which form views as to where their aged should be nursed or cared for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As promised in the 1977 policy speech, an additional $ 100 per child is payable in 1978 to <span class="highlight">families</span> living in tax zones A and B whose children are eligible for the basic boarding allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been described as a dishonest and unfair Budget- unfair because its restraints are directed at those who are least capable of bearing them; unfair because its whole strategy has been directed against the poor, the sick, the elderly and the great majority of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that I have already given enough instances of where the Budget is unfair and discriminatory against the poor, the sick, the elderly and the great majority of our <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>About two million <span class="highlight">families</span> receive family allowances and in order to apply a means or income test it will be necessary to ask all of them to return information to the department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present we have no record of the income of children or of <span class="highlight">families</span> because of the universal nature of the family allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am unable to give any indication as to how many <span class="highlight">families</span> or children would be affected by the decision because, as I say, we have no knowledge of their income, but I am advised by the Treasury that on the basis of its knowledge of the income of children, from income tax returns, it estimates the savings which I reported yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My department has no information on these lines concerning income of <span class="highlight">families</span> or of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, is she saying that two million Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> will now be under continual scrutiny by this Government as to how much any child in a family may earn? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I advise that there will be an annual requirement for <span class="highlight">families</span> to advise the income that was received in the previous year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government be informing all <span class="highlight">families</span> affected by this new provision of the appeal provisions which are available to them under various Acts? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister refute this statement and confirm that the Cabinet has the closest concern for ordinary people and that the Budget is an honest Budget building a very real increase in the prosperity of <span class="highlight">families</span> and the people of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a tendency now for breakups to occur among <span class="highlight">families</span> whose breadwinner is insecure because he does not know from one day to the next whether his livelihood is in jeopardy or whether he has a job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I predict that, because of the excise that has been imposed and because the growers in the Riverland area cannot sell their grapes, there will be great pressures on <span class="highlight">families</span> there and family breakups will occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The child endowment and tax rebate schemes which previously existed were both a recognition of the fact that to rear a child costs money and that <span class="highlight">families</span> with children, whether they are rich or poor <span class="highlight">families</span>, had expenses associated with child rearing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first and most obvious fault in the new proposals is that they will penalise poor <span class="highlight">families</span> the most, as do so many of this Government ‘s actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may not even be a large number of poor <span class="highlight">families</span> affected but individually they will be affected and those who will be affected the most will be the poorest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some <span class="highlight">families</span>, particularly those on benefits or on minimum wages, the children earn their own pocket money, sometimes to the extent of $20 or $30 a week, and sometimes even $40 a week, by delivering newspapers, selling newspapers, working in shops and in part time jobs in factories, and doing various other jobs in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such <span class="highlight">families</span> will not notice the drop in income which may result from this provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But this proposal will cause distress to some very poor <span class="highlight">families</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these women or poor <span class="highlight">families</span> are to be deprived of these payments in part or whole by this proposal it is an unjust measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Grimes  has done a lot of worthwhile work on how this decision will affect individual <span class="highlight">families</span> and what the realities of income reduction will be, but I suggest with the greatest of respect to him that he would make a more worthwhile contribution to the debate, and certainly one which would have more relevance to the women of Australia, if he recognised that the mother’s allowance is to be penalised because of the child ‘s income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it possible to means test these people without discouraging enterprising children, many of whom are from low income <span class="highlight">families</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier today and last week, some children are in receipt of a trust income, and income-splitting devices are used within <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Personal exertion on the part of children in order to support their <span class="highlight">families</span> in difficult circumstances is in some way to limit the family allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The South Australian Housing Trust is still continuing to build units for low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that there has been a misuse of resources in that if 900 apartments or other forms of low cost housing are available the Housing Trust could enter into arrangements with private developers to take over for a limited term or a definite lease period some of these properties for leasing at subsidised rentals to low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, it could provide this accommodation to low income <span class="highlight">families</span> on the same basis as it would otherwise build houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the administrative complexities and the inequities which could arise between <span class="highlight">families</span> with regard to the means testing of family allowances, it has been decided that the present arrangement for family allowances will continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a locally elected senator- a representative of this community- I am very much aware of the long delays in attending to very urgent matters, such as processing housing applications, processing applications for emergency housing for homeless <span class="highlight">families</span>, processing applications for emergency welfare assistance from women who have been deserted or from homeless youth or any other person in urgent need of assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be quite evident to honourable senators present that there would be many <span class="highlight">families</span> whose combined income might be slightly in excess of $232 a week but who would in no way be able to qualify for private housing finance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has refused to increase the staff of the Legal Aid Office and in order to save approximately $100,000 the Government has refused to adjust Commonwealth Government employees’ compensation pensions and has thus ensured deprivation for the widows and <span class="highlight">families</span> of public servants killed in the line of duty and for those invalided out of their work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More importantly, from my point of view, we have a critical situation in terms of the future of the hundreds of thousands of <span class="highlight">families</span> who live and work in the Territory, whose children have been borne here and who would have hoped a few years ago to have their futures here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that to do that the Government would persist in its endeavours to have full personal tax indexation, that it would make improvements in its assistance to <span class="highlight">families</span>, and that it would retain Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I commend to the Government for its consideration the problems and stresses of <span class="highlight">families</span> with children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Additional amounts have been provided for the Northern Territory and, as promised in the 1977 policy speech of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  an additional $ 100 per child is payable under the isolated children’s program to <span class="highlight">families</span> living in certain tax zones whose children are eligible for basic boarding allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While  Senator Ryan  is fighting hard for the minority of women, the majority of women (and not only those in her electorate) are hoping for a better deal for single-income <span class="highlight">families</span> so that they will not have to leave their <span class="highlight">families</span> and seek work outside the home for economic reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Ryan replied no to our question: ‘Do you support removing the present economic discrimination against single-income <span class="highlight">families</span> by (1) indexation of family allowances?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that the people in the union system who wish to create more employment opportunities should at least consider their mates and not take part in wild cat, rat baggery strikes that give no benefit to them or to their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister seen a report in the  Sunday Sun  newspaper of 24 September 1978 wherein it was reported that 100 local residents on Bribie Island, Queensland, have signed a petition to be presented to the honourable C. R. Porter, M.L.A., the Queensland Minister for Aborigines and Islanders Advancement, opposing the construction by his Department of a holiday home on that Island to be used by selected <span class="highlight">families</span> from the Cherbourg Aboriginal Mission on the grounds that such a home and its intended inhabitants would have a detrimental effect on surrounding land values? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to know how many applicants for the job had the physique necessary to fill the requirements, as well as the other essential qualifications, and how many of the people who had competing claims for the job were married men with <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Had the sum been greater than that it could have been something of a deterrent for <span class="highlight">families</span> with four or five children travelling overseas in a group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such <span class="highlight">families</span> could have been rather seriously affected by a charge running up to $ 100 or $200. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general terms, I believe we can expect higher unemployment among women, decreased spending power, especially among lower income <span class="highlight">families</span>, reduced services, and hardship arising from the decision to index pensions only once yearly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The imposition of a means test on a child’s income, which has now been withdrawn, showed among other things an appalling lack of awareness and sensitivity on the part of the Government of how lower income <span class="highlight">families</span> live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the other address was unsatisfactory only because the building was not big enough to cater for all of the <span class="highlight">families</span> that needed the support of a women’s refuge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was confused, for instance, about the means test which was to apply to the family allowances of <span class="highlight">families</span> where the children receive an income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the Budget is disgraceful because it attacks those people who are least capable, those who are already disadvantaged- the pensioners, the young <span class="highlight">families</span>, the children, the workers, the sick and the unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Australian Government at the present session put forward specific and positive proposals that are consistent with its publicly stated policies on East Timor in an attempt to overcome the conflict and suffering in the territory and to secure early reunion of Timorese <span class="highlight">families</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may perhaps be desirable to levy a heavier burden on the smoker and the drinker than on other people but if so, it has to be remembered that the real sacrifice will be borne by the <span class="highlight">families</span> of those on whom it is intended to lay the real impost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This sort of action in my view will cause untold hardship to many migrant <span class="highlight">families</span> with relatives and particularly close relatives living overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many of our beef producers have had to go out and take often quite menial and not particularly highly paid jobs and have had to leave their wives and <span class="highlight">families</span> on their properties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question of achieving equality of opportunity inside education lies not only with fees or allowances: It lies also, of course, with our moving Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> as far as we can up the socio-economic scale in terms of standards of living so that their conditions are conducive to further study for the young. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was intended to introduce an administratively difficult and unjust means test on family allowances which would partly have the effect of penalising poor <span class="highlight">families</span> whose children helped out by earning small amounts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further reason can be seen from the manner in which this legislation and the manner in which this Government, since it has been in power, have failed to recognise- it has frequently taken steps to disadvantage them- <span class="highlight">families</span> with children, particularly <span class="highlight">families</span> of those in receipt of various social security benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We need a greater explanation of the reasons for these changes and we need an explanation of the effects of the changes, the effects on some of the migrant communities, the migrant <span class="highlight">families</span>, and the effects on the Government purse, before we will agree willingly to what may or may not be reasonable changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will those <span class="highlight">families</span> be disadvantaged by this measure, and to what extent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>It has also failed completely in many cases to give us any details of the effects on the <span class="highlight">families</span> who will be so badly affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The family allowance was introduced and this, despite what the Opposition could possibly say, was the biggest boon to the very low income <span class="highlight">families</span> that it was possible for any government to introduce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The family allowance was not of any greater assistance than the previous arrangements to higher income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is aimed particularly at assisting <span class="highlight">families</span> in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the family allowance is to be paid monthly now, it is my belief that <span class="highlight">families</span> in receipt of an allowance will receive exactly the same amount in any one year as they would have received previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I preface my question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, with a reminder that since 1974 a total of $95,000 has been allocated by the Federal Government to the Australian Council of Trade Unions for research into the needs of trade unionists and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Can the Minister say whether the results of this research have been published and whether in fact the research has provided the basis for any decision which may have been taken in regard to trade unionists and their <span class="highlight">families</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I confirm that grants totalling $95,000 have been allocated to the ACTU since 1974 to establish and support a social welfare research unit for research into the needs of trade unionists and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They include: ‘Welfare in Industry: Changing Perspective’, reports; Worker Participation in Management: The Australian Context’; a submission to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs on migrants in the work force: ‘Social Policy and Problems of the Work Force’, volumes 1 and 2; ‘Adequacy of Income Derived from Work for Low Income <span class="highlight">Families</span> in the Williamstown- Altona areas’; Development of a Working Women’s Charter’, submission to the Task Force on Co-ordination in Welfare and Health; a submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare concerning the inquiry into the adequacy of Australian health and welfare services; and ‘The Collection and Dissemination of Information on Social Welfare Programs and the Role of Trade Unions in the Direct Provision of Welfare Services’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example a migrant couple from country Z- it does not matter what country it is- comes to Australia, having been attracted here, as <span class="highlight">families</span> were until recently, by our immigration policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are the people who have contributed throughout their whole lifetimes to this country through working, many of them through raising <span class="highlight">families</span>, through taxes and through their labours in the various areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The abolition of this benefit, combined with the failure to increase the allowances for pensioners’ children and other beneficiaries’ children and the failure to index the family allowances will contribute to the difficulties of low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The family research project was established in 1 972 because of growing concern about the growing numbers of oneparent <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia and about the social and other implications of this trend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second worry concerns the low income <span class="highlight">families</span> who can afford neither to pay the insurance premiums nor to pay their 60 per cent share of the cost of treatment; the Government of course pays 40 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps it may save a few unnecessary consultations for low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is equally likely, perhaps more likely, to deter such <span class="highlight">families</span> from seeking medical assistance when they really should do so, which may involve the community in much greater costs in the long run. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government was against the levy proposed by the Australian Labor Party, which was a levy without any ceiling, a levy that disadvantaged the two-income <span class="highlight">families</span>, a levy that did not make allowance for the two-income <span class="highlight">families</span> who were earning low incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To me it is a recognition that in this day and age, instead of our living in the unenlightened society that has prevailed in this country and many other Western countries for centuries, the veil is lifting and people will see reason and will be able to assist those who want to plan their lives and be able to plan their <span class="highlight">families</span> so that they will support the children that they can afford to rear and the ones that they feel that they are capable of seeing through their early childhood on to maturity, and in that way fulfil their proper destiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can only say to other senators in this chamber that if they regard this issue as being a very peripheral one they should take a little time out, meet these people and see the circumstances in which some Timorese <span class="highlight">families</span> are living in Melbourne, and then come back to this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Would the Minister contemplate establishing a judicial inquiry to report on the activities of these cults in Australia ensuring, firstly, that no intrusion into or harrassment of genuine and non-harmful groups by the inquiry is permitted and that true freedom to worship is not impaired in any way and, secondly, that the criteria of such an inquiry includes the following: Whether the sect requires from members compulsory financial contributions to the cult or its ‘spiritual’ leader; whether physical or mental damage is exerted or threatened to cult members or their <span class="highlight">families</span>; whether undue influence is placed on family structures to induce family breakups; and any other associated matters which the Government in its wisdom considers appropriate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the undertakings given by the Government some 18 months ago in relation to the question of reunification of Timorese refugees with their <span class="highlight">families</span> in Timor, particularly the fathers of <span class="highlight">families</span> in Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage I am unable to add to anything I have said earlier and that is that it is the Government’s stated intention that it will facilitate and pursue the reunification of Timorese <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can it be assumed, as perhaps some Government supporters would wish to assume, that all school leavers have <span class="highlight">families</span> to support them; that they somehow have a lesser need for unemployment benefit than other unemployed persons? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is simply not the case that all school leavers have comfortable, affluent <span class="highlight">families</span> to support them through their first few months of unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact which Government supporters seem to forget is that there are still many poor <span class="highlight">families</span> in this country and most of those teenagers who are leaving school at 1 5 or 16 years of age without completing the high school are leaving precisely because their parents are poor and cannot afford to keep them at school and college. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the majority of young people who leave school at the age of IS or 16 do so because their <span class="highlight">families</span> cannot support them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For many poorer <span class="highlight">families</span> in our community the small payment of $36, which is the payment for the youth unemployed, makes a significant difference to the family income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People and <span class="highlight">families</span> have to have a roof over their heads, and whilst every little ratty room in Australia has its rent increased every time there is a pension rise, there is no increase in the amount of decent and cheap accommodation into which pensioners can go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The organisation and formulation of government policies- I make this comment irrespective of party lines- which bear on the family situation are very much structured towards encouraging the continuance of the nuclear family and against the possibility of encouraging wider and more supportive relationships in <span class="highlight">families</span> which involve more than just a husband, a wife and two children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No doubt  Senator Carrick  will be familiar with the Prime Minister’s frequently stated beliefs that a household budget is just like a national Budget; that deficits have to be paid back; that nations, like <span class="highlight">families</span>, must live in hardship while deficits are being paid back; and that deficits incurred under Labor condemned the nation to prolonged poverty, and so on and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am aware of public statements that have been made recently with regard to the income of single parent <span class="highlight">families</span> and the difficulties which they have in sustaining the family on this income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that what has been established and quoted as the poverty line is something which may have doubtful validity because of its origin and the fact that it is based on relativities between expenditures of different <span class="highlight">families</span> in New York in 1954. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you listened, you would know that I was saying that the poverty line established by the expert commission- it was the Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Poverty which came down with that poverty linewas based on relativities between expenditures of different <span class="highlight">families</span> in New York in 1954. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 1974 survey confirmed earlier findings that over 50 per cent of university students in Australia are drawn from <span class="highlight">families</span> where the father has a professional occupation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose  of TEAS is seen as providing a subsidy to those students and their <span class="highlight">families</span> who are unable or whom it would be unreasonable to expect to provide all of the costs normally expected to come from sources other than the public purse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to assess that statement of what I believe to be still the Government’s position in relation to student allowances in the light of a number of points made in the statement itself, and also in the light of the 1974 survey finding that some 50 per cent of the Australian student population in universities came from <span class="highlight">families</span> with professional backgrounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second purpose of TEAS stated in the comment to which I referred was that it was intended to subsidise those students of <span class="highlight">families</span> who are unable to provide all of the costs normally expected to come from sources other than the public purse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I put it to the Senate quite seriously that this affects students and particularly those students or prospective students who are still dependent upon their parents and who come from low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another area of anomaly relates to the assumed capacity of middle income <span class="highlight">families</span> to contribute to their children’s tertiary education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In many respects, some middle income earners are worse off than <span class="highlight">families</span> on low incomes in relation to their capacity to support a student. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support that view by making the point that usually students who come from low income <span class="highlight">families</span> receive the full TEAS allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Students from the middle income bracket <span class="highlight">families</span> are often means tested out of an allowance altogether. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we get no assistance in this area, surely the poorer <span class="highlight">families</span> are going to be at an extreme disadvantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister’s defence, admirable as it was, does not dissipate the anxiety felt throughout the community and by senators in this chamber about the Government’s intentions with regard to social security and low income <span class="highlight">families</span> in the next Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The poor, the pensioners, the unemployed and their <span class="highlight">families</span> slip further behind in their ability to maintain a reasonable standard of living for themselves and their <span class="highlight">families</span>, while big business and others in a position to exploit the economic circumstances make profits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The end result will be that most Australians, particularly those with <span class="highlight">families</span>, will have to pay more than they can afford for health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He referred to a national income survey taken in 1975 which showed that 7.3 per cent of <span class="highlight">families</span> had incomes below the poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The words of Cardinal Freeman are very pertinent to what I am saying today because the tax and health measures of the mini-Budget will force more Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> than the 7.3 per cent who are already in poverty into poverty and into the concomitant distress of living in poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well as its attacks on the well-being of <span class="highlight">families</span>, the mini-Budget is a scandalous document because of what it has omitted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been no indexing of family allowances since they were increased and no attempt to compensate <span class="highlight">families</span> for the loss of income which resulted from the abolition of the rebate scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply draw the attention of the Senate again to figures which show that as at the end of the last financial year the following losses have been incurred by <span class="highlight">families</span> as a result of the failure of the Government to index or increase the family allowance payment: For a family with one child the loss has been $3.50 a week, for a family with two children, $8.50 a week; for a family with three children, $ 14.50; for a family with three children with one student child, $14.50; and for a family with three children with two student children, $ 14.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that by the changeover to the family allowance system, which initially was of benefit to <span class="highlight">families</span>, this has now become another area in which <span class="highlight">families</span> are failing to keep up with inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mini-Budget which was presented last week contained no relief for taxpayers, <span class="highlight">families</span> or pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With all the social problems that are rife in the community at the moment- in particular the drug problem but also the problems of violence, sexual violence and so on- <span class="highlight">families</span> are not happy with the situation where 16 and 17-year- old girls and boys will be forced to leave home to travel to other cities or to country towns in search of work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the worst effects was the terrible disruption to <span class="highlight">families</span> caused by the breadwinner and young people leaving home to search for work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the appropriate response to the level of youth unemployment, not these veiled threats and accusations of being dole bludgers; not these insinuations that we are to have work tests that will create even more pressure and strain on <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I acknowledge that there has been no increase in the rates that have been given to family allowance payments, but $ 1,000m is spent on family allowances in this country and a factor that is not recognised is that in the 1976 Budget this Government replaced the Hayden tax rebates for children and child endowment with family allowances, and this initiative brought greatly increased assistance to some 300,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> with 800,000 children who did not benefit from the Hayden scheme of tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That additional number of the lowest income people who were not able to have the advantage of tax rebates-300,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> and 800,000 children- are now receiving substantial family allowances, whereas they were unable to take advantage of the tax rebates because of the level of their income in previous years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, we have 100,000 or more people in low income <span class="highlight">families</span> who have been bulk billed by doctors and have been treated in the way the Government expected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What am I to say to these fair and just requests for Federal Government action to alleviate their distress, when the Leader of the Government in this chamber so strenuously and heatedly defends and encourages the continuing raids on our national Treasury by one of the wealthiest <span class="highlight">families</span> in Europe? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Families</span> will face payments of up to $ 1 2 to $ 1 3 a week in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, and only slightly less in other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Ryan  has blandly said that <span class="highlight">families</span> will pay $ 12 a week for their health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may suit her politically to make those statements, but to blandly say that <span class="highlight">families</span> will have to pay $12 a week for their health care shows that she has no human compassion at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let us refer to the <span class="highlight">families</span> whom  Senator Ryan  said will have to pay $12 a week for health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that  Senator Ryan  has deliberately misled the public in her statement that <span class="highlight">families</span> will have to pay $12. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore submit that most <span class="highlight">families</span> in this area are precluded from benefit under this scheme because of the Geelong link or tieup and ask that consideration be given to an amendment to allow the physical and actual situation as it appears, to be the criteria, rather than non factual criteria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation that is before us is a further blow to <span class="highlight">families</span>, particularly to the single low income family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">families</span> and <span class="highlight">families</span> as a whole have been reeling from the lack of attention given to them and from the failure of the Government to restore the value of family allowances which, as a result of cost increases, have been eroded by 32 per cent since they were introduced in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister at that stage said, in his memory, those allowances were the greatest policy initiatives ever taken on behalf of <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amongst other things, the high cost of housing for <span class="highlight">families</span> is continuing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course medical and hospital insurance fees will skyrocket, and this will be a further blow to <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cabinet leaks have indicated that there will be income splitting for the purposes of taxation and that possible action will be taken to help <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All these things have raised expectations amongst the <span class="highlight">families</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government would be well advised to heed these cries from the <span class="highlight">families</span> who are being disaffected and take remedial action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I listened carefully to the last  speaker, Senator Harradine,  and I assure him that many of his colleagues in the Senate understand and share his concern for the family, for its place, and for the stresses under which <span class="highlight">families</span> are operating more and more in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those issues of horizontal equity include the capacity of <span class="highlight">families</span> to enjoy the same standard of living as that enjoyed by single income earners with no responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-If Senator Georges will wait I will give the credit to the migrant children and to the excellent stimuli of the migrant <span class="highlight">families</span> and motivation of their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some of what they earn is sent abroad to maintain <span class="highlight">families</span> and relatives overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Recently the Federal Government allowed 1 8 American <span class="highlight">families</span> to enter Australia to establish a multimillion dollar jewellery manufacturing business in Perth, but the decision may have been coloured by the fact that a significant investment was involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, not much effort is made to see to it that we attract doctors from multi-cultural backgrounds who may be able to assist the migrant <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only way that these people will be able to have reunions with their <span class="highlight">families</span> is by going home to Greece. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they do not they will lose contact with their <span class="highlight">families</span> and the areas from which they came. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our very good wishes and thanks go also to  Mrs Odgers  who has served with her husband during the period of his work in the Senate, with all the strain on her patience and understanding which the sitting hours of this place impose upon wives and <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further anomaly that occurs to one as a result of the absence of any pro rata provision is the extraordinary one that judges may feel themselves placed by this legislation in a position where it is financially advantageous to them, or at least I suppose I should say to their <span class="highlight">families</span>, for them to die on the job, to continue working when they are manifestly ill, rather than retiring, because if they are in a situation where they have not yet accumulated their basic 10 years’ service they will get no cash return in lieu of long service leave forgone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has given to our veterans and their <span class="highlight">families</span> the security of knowing that their pensions are not eroded by inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am aware of recent comments made by a Departmental nutritionist in regard to excessive use of ‘fast’ foods and ‘take away’ meals by some <span class="highlight">families</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-86-56">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I seek an opportunity on the adjournment debate to raise a few comments on the topic of the reunification of Timorese <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  you,  Mr President,  and honourable senators would know that the interim measure adopted in these cases- what might be almost a stop-gap measure- is for Australian members of a family to send money to their <span class="highlight">families</span>, whether it be to Timor, Malaysia or elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This created misery for their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Hayden  described this Budget as representing an attack on the <span class="highlight">families</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he were to look at what had been achieved by the Government through the use of the funds of the Australian people he would see that in four years we have increased our assistance to <span class="highlight">families</span> from $34 1 m under the last Hayden Budget to $ 1,053m in this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever people may say about that scheme I would think that the Australian Labor Party would have accorded recognition to the fact that it has brought to 300,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> assistance that they have not previously enjoyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the Family Allowances are paid at the same level to the most wealthy and poor <span class="highlight">families</span> has been the subject of question and debate since they were introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need to increase the level of payments has been obvious in the case of low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that that is considerable recognition of the needs of <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It represents a considerable measure of support to the <span class="highlight">families</span> who will now be introduced to this benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Hayden did not choose to mention that the children’s services program is playing an essential role in the support of low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The direction of this program has been to assist those low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and those with special needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has doubled the assistance given to those <span class="highlight">families</span> where children’s services are vital and where family support services are required for the strength of the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has considered a national superannuation scheme, which was suggested in the Hancock report, and it has rejected the introduction of that scheme because it has recognised that it may place a very heavy burden on the lower and middle income <span class="highlight">families</span> where the responsibility of raising children already imposes heavy costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Hayden might not know why but most <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>People with young <span class="highlight">families</span> need health care because of the things that can happen to kiddies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are in extreme desperation bringing up <span class="highlight">families</span> on that sort of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They want to keep their <span class="highlight">families</span> in their own way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although operating on 1979 prices, <span class="highlight">families</span> have been left with the level of assistance that was deemed reasonable in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall quote to the Senate some interesting figures which show the distribution of incomes among <span class="highlight">families</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish also to refer to the carriage of Ministers ‘ <span class="highlight">families</span> on aircraft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will also affect the low income family, particularly the single income family and the large <span class="highlight">families</span> with children who frequently get ill and who frequently need prescriptions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basis of any civilised system of health care throughout the world should be that those who need assistance with health care should get it, so that the poor, the disadvantaged, the chronically ill or the large <span class="highlight">families</span> do not suffer from lack of access to our health care system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ask it to withdraw this Bill, redraft it and, after consultation with its experts, provide a means whereby the unemployed, the large <span class="highlight">families</span>, the people on supporting parents benefits in the first six months, the low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and, particularly, <span class="highlight">families</span> with children can be identified in an equitable fashion as being disadvantaged so that they can receive the same sort of treatment as far as pharmaceutical benefits are concerned as the pensioners and single parents, after the first six months, get at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Families</span> will face payments of up to $12 to $13 a week in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She was talking about what most <span class="highlight">families</span> will have to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the small amount of $2.68 a week, people can have full cover for their <span class="highlight">families</span> for hospital treatment and 75 per cent of the schedule fee for doctors fees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people, if they are not able to receive medication without charge, or at a reduced charge, will be disadvantaged next Saturday morning as will the unemployed, especially the unemployed with large <span class="highlight">families</span> who cannot receive a pensioner health benefit card. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that perhaps they would, because there are many <span class="highlight">families</span>, especially those in which in recent years a working wife has lost her job, in which that additional cost would have to be met by doing without some item of food or clothing, which those of us in this chamber would regard as absolutely essential and would normally take for granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these sums seem trifling to honourable senators on the Government side, perhaps it is because they do not understand that the economy of many <span class="highlight">families</span> is now literally balanced on a knife edge and as costs rise steadily, is deteriorating, not improving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has centred around the large <span class="highlight">families</span>, the poor, the disadvantaged and the people for whom the payment of costs may be difficult. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was disappointed when I heard my colleague  Senator Grimes  advancing what are really hypothetical cases- large <span class="highlight">families</span> with all the kids sick, with this happening and that happening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was difficult enough for <span class="highlight">families</span> to afford health insurance when they were paying out $400 or $500 a year for cover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, <span class="highlight">families</span> are faced with going without any medical cover whatsoever and wondering what will happen to them or paying out $700 a year for health insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be seen in this report, for instance, that some attention is given to a particular example involving a matter of the law as it relates to <span class="highlight">families</span> in which a judge of the New South Wales Supreme Court was able to draw attention to the fact that the operation of the law as it was, and even the operation of the law as it had been updated by the passage of the Family Law Act, nevertheless had brought about a situation which, from the community’s point of view, was entirely unsatisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, if practices are being employed which affect or endanger people’s health and extort large sums of money from converts and their <span class="highlight">families</span>, I believe it is time that the governments of Australia had a look at them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In many cases, great concern is expressed about the methods used to recruit people, especially as they relate to the recruitment of children and the impact of such measures on <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator will be aware of the great pleasure accorded many <span class="highlight">families</span> which have built up a stock of such fish over many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet instead of these people being shown compassion, they are stigmatised and criticised and, in many cases, even driven from the homes of their <span class="highlight">families</span> because they are unable to find work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senate that the Fraser Government is a government which promised to govern for all Australians and which has presided in the intervening years over a declining standard of living for most Australians, a fall in the value of disposable income for most <span class="highlight">families</span>, increased health costs, higher interest rates and increased petrol prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have brought in family allowances, an heroic change in concept, in order to transfer wealth to the mothers of the lowest income <span class="highlight">families</span> and the largest <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The bottom 10 per cent of <span class="highlight">families</span> receive only 2.2 per cent of aggregate income while the top 10 per cent gain 23 per cent of all income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly,  Senator Button  said that interest rates had risen since the Fraser Government came to power and that this was somehow reducing the real incomes of <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All this is completely consistent with the Fraser social value judgments and with the style of the lord of Nareen, who tells the ordinary wage earners, people and <span class="highlight">families</span> on middle incomes that they have to accept a drop in their real standard of living while he swans around the world in tandem Boeing 707s at a cost to the taxpayer of $20m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the single parent is subsidised, <span class="highlight">families</span> are undermined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we look at the distribution of family income in Australia, we find that the bottom 10 per cent of income earning <span class="highlight">families</span> receive only 2.2 per cent of income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The top 10 per cent of income earning <span class="highlight">families</span> earns 23 per cent of income- almost exactly 10 times as much per family as those <span class="highlight">families</span> in the low income group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These <span class="highlight">families</span> have very little to live on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Recently I have seen unionists, in an attempt to keep money flowing to their <span class="highlight">families</span>, obliged to draw on their holiday pay- to bring into the house a few scant dollars so that food can be bought for the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  has had to admit that the present tax system disadvantages single income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those people include <span class="highlight">families</span> which rely on the breadwinner for their income, but the breadwinner is unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only now that there is a higher level of industrial disputes because in spite of the high unemployment the standard of living of the <span class="highlight">families</span> of this country has been so eroded by this Government’s policies that unions have increasingly resorted in more recent months to industrial disputation and involvement in industrial disputation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Payment of state and other assistance toward the maintenance of children of large <span class="highlight">families</span> is desirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Case loads are so extensive that social workers have not got the time which is emerging as the essence of the healing process in those <span class="highlight">families</span> which are fractured and where the child is at risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need to ensure that funds from governments support those voluntary organisations which are prepared to tap that tremendous resource in the community and make it available for these <span class="highlight">families</span> at risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can think- perhaps we have been blessed in our <span class="highlight">families</span>- that this is not applicable to an affluent and easy going society like Australia and that those rights do not need to be fought for and secured on behalf of our children; but, in fact, they do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am trying to say is that at the moment, given the fact that the law does not provide for compensation for children injured while within the womb, we have hundreds, perhaps thousands, of literally born losers coming into our community without receiving the financial compensation which might make their growing into maturity somewhat easier on their parents and <span class="highlight">families</span>, who have to support them with their deformity or injury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have understandably not prepared ourselves for any fees, and they will constitute a burden beyond the capacity of our <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will get telegrams and letters from university student representative councils and student bodies saying that the average income of these <span class="highlight">families</span> is of the order of $9,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Leader of the Government agree with the Treasurer’s recent admission in Brisbane that single income <span class="highlight">families</span> were disadvantaged in the Budget? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790918_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that the traditional tax scales, tax deductions and tax rebate systems which have evolved over the years and which both the Whitlam and Fraser governments have adopted in various modifications, tend to disadvantage single income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790918_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the recruitment of their members, especially as this relates to children and the impact on <span class="highlight">families</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-The public listening to the broadcast of this debate and members of the public in the gallery would have been shocked to have heard the Leader of the Government in the Senate  (Senator Carrick)  say that the Labor Party is wasting the time of the Senate in bringing to the public’s attention the well known fact that as young <span class="highlight">families</span> seek to raise money in order to buy a home and furnish it, to clothe themselves and to buy a motor vehicle, they are faced with crippling interest rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They need to borrow, to buy credit and to commit themselves and their <span class="highlight">families</span> to repay principal and interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a massive insecurity and unease in the Australian community, a community that should be, given our wealth producing capacity, able to provide goods, services, homes, motor vehicles, clothing and furniture to all Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> without their having to seek loans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have to seek loans because ofthe Government’s policy to reduce disposable real wages and other support for persons and <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly agree that this is a satisfactory situation, but the inference that might have been drawn from the comments made earlier was that some <span class="highlight">families</span> might be existing on $80 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The children were crying- I asked if we could first go home and join our <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have used threats by way of unsigned and signed circulars, unsigned and threatening telephone calls and letters and in certain instances violence was perpetrated, though people were and are still afraid to witness because of threats to them or their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  direct a question to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs which relates to the fact that many Aboriginal communities are fragmenting to quite a degree, w-h many tribal <span class="highlight">families</span> and clans returning to their tribal homelands under what has been termed the outstation movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is positive in the sense that the movement usually occurs away from centres where groups of Aboriginal people from different tribes, <span class="highlight">families</span> and so on have been gathered together and where there has been a growth of tension and a social dislocation resulting in antisocial behaviour and often excessive drinking and things of that sort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is a matter of historical record that Simon Fraser was one of the people involved in floating land banks in Melbourne in the 1 880s and 1 890s and that the fortunes of that family were partially established at the expense of the depositors who lost their money in those banks; that that was not the only fortune in Melbourne that was established that way; and that  Mr Fraser  is not the only descendant of <span class="highlight">families</span> which established their fortunes in that way who currently sits in this Parliament representing the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s refugee resettlement policy is designed to ensure, as far as possible, that <span class="highlight">families</span> are kept together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a point of principle involved in deciding what constitutes a close relationship and whether brothers and sisters of mature age, and perhaps having their own <span class="highlight">families</span>, should be included in the concessional arrangements for refugees, possibly at the expense of reuniting immediate <span class="highlight">families</span> within Australia’s annual refugee program limitation of 14,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not clear from the statements made that in future the <span class="highlight">families</span> of those persons who may be trained and who are presently maintained by unemployment benefit would have that responsibility transferred to them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Families</span> are losing their investments and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is now reflected in the tremendous price which young people have to pay these days for land in order to build a home for themselves and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore the Senate has a responsibility to the <span class="highlight">families</span> of Australia not to adopt this controversial Report and its Recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that some <span class="highlight">families</span> in Adelaide have decided to collect food, such as sugar, milk powder and other supplies, to assist the relief effort in Kampuchea and that they are doing so because they feel that actual cartons of food collected here are more physically visible than money contributions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister also aware that, having collected quantities of food, these <span class="highlight">families</span> now have no way of getting it to Kampuchea and have been unable to get advice on where to go with their cartons of food? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I am aware from this morning’s newspapers that in the past week or two $350,000 has been given by Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> to a Kampuchean aid committee’s fund target of $2m authorised by the highly reputable Australian Council for the Overseas Aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that the present deregistration provisions are not adequate to deal with the special circumstances where organisations, or sections of them, endanger the safety, health or welfare of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These new provisions are designed specifically to protect the job security, safety, health or welfare of Australian men and women and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ordinary working <span class="highlight">families</span> will suffer noise and disturbance during ordinary sleeping hours from the noise created by these unacceptably large domestic units <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For despite the Government’s substantial contraction of the original proposal to construct and convert dwellings to meet the special needs of extended Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span> the rancour has spread and intensified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These houses were constructed many years ago by the welfare authorities as emergency accommodation for <span class="highlight">families</span> in crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But they are still on the training wage trying to bring up <span class="highlight">families</span> of eight to 10 kids. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one goes to Yarrabah one finds that the houses are falling down around the heads of the <span class="highlight">families</span> who live in them because they are riddled with white ants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat my question: For those young people who fall outside such transitional training schemes, can the Minister give a categorical denial that they will be forced back on their <span class="highlight">families</span> for support once they leave school? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department receives regular reports on the activities of officers at our posts on behalf of these persons and advice is conveyed to <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia where this is agreed to by the person detained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Very needy <span class="highlight">families</span> may also qualify for a special supplementary allowance of up to $550 per annum, the maximum of which is payable at an adjusted family income level of $5,800 per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does the Government expect members of the trade union movement and their <span class="highlight">families</span> to live when inflation is on the rise when it will not even grant them the equivalent of the CPI? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It deals with <span class="highlight">families</span> using a sort of conscripted labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of them formed part of that great company of people who survived the journey across the South China Sea and were placed on the island of Bidong, where they were being looked after in an administrative capacity by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and agencies in Malyasia and Kuala Lumpur, such as the Red Crescent organisation, which was carrying out the distribution of food and medical supplies and, indeed, was carrying out an enormous amount’ of detailed work in relation to correspondence and the distribution of the refugees to enable <span class="highlight">families</span> to stay together if at all possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further point I would like to bring up is that it seems to discriminate against <span class="highlight">families</span>, unless there is a family rate rather than the individual rate that is listed in the Minister’s second reading speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we try to analyse the program, perhaps it emerges like this: Many of the homeless are young; they are alienated from their <span class="highlight">families</span>; they did not do especially well at school; and they cannot find work or they are so demoralised they have given up trying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of its main messages is that there is an urgent need for Australians of all backgrounds to draw together in a common endeavour to support our way of life- to give ourselves- individually, our <span class="highlight">families</span> and our nation a better chance in a changing world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposals will add to reforms which have already benefited low income <span class="highlight">families</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that the current family allowance scheme brought increased assistance to some 300,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> with 800,000 children who, simply because of their low incomes did not benefit fully, or at all, from the previous system of tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They remain at the level of $36 a week that they were given in 1975, despite escalating costs, despite a great increase in their numbers and particularly despite the fact that, as was noted by all speakers on the legislation dealing with the homeless persons assistance program, they are increasingly joining the ranks of the homeless in the community because of their own unemployment and because of family stress caused by adult unemployment in their <span class="highlight">families</span> and homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The proposals will add to reforms which have already benefited low income <span class="highlight">families</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to examine this statement and look at the low income <span class="highlight">families</span> to see how they have been treated by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so, I wish to draw attention to an area of need not considered by the Government, and question seriously the priorities that this Government has in dealing with the so-called low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The first is a comparison of poverty lines and the disposable incomes of various low income <span class="highlight">families</span> in the community, produced by the Statistical Service of the Parliamentary Library. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All those single income <span class="highlight">families</span> with the head of the family working are below the poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second list of low income <span class="highlight">families</span> shows that the pensioner or the unemployed person with more than one child is always below the poverty line if he has no income other than his pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These are the lowest of the low income <span class="highlight">families</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We may ask how the Government, which expresses such concern for low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, has treated them under the social services provisions of our legislation in general. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the initial benefit given to low income <span class="highlight">families</span> by the introduction of family allowances in 1976, a family with three children is $20 a month worse off and a family with five children is $39 a month worse off in real terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So much for assistance to the really low income <span class="highlight">families</span> in this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to point out that the low income <span class="highlight">families</span> who increase rapidly in numbers and who, of all the <span class="highlight">families</span> shown on these tables, are worse off are the <span class="highlight">families</span> of the unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The poor <span class="highlight">families</span> and the single unemployed will suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The conservative journal the Melbourne  Herald  stated:   it would be outrageous to deny sustenance to stood - down unionists and their <span class="highlight">families</span> not involved in the dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that by far the majority of those under 1 8 years of age are still supported partially by their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their <span class="highlight">families</span> still provide a roof over their heads. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the majority of <span class="highlight">families</span> are still anxious to support their children, both emotionally and in a material sense, at least until they are 18 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My suggestion-I make no bones about it- is that increases in the amount of money spent on family allowances should, if possible, be distributed more to those in need, the low income <span class="highlight">families</span> which I spoke about and whose position was demonstrated in the tables which were incorporated in  Hansard,  and less to <span class="highlight">families</span> on high incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difficulty that we have- as I pointed out at the second reading stage and in the tables which reviewed the people on low incomes and in poverty in this community- is that the unemployed group, particularly the unemployed <span class="highlight">families</span>, stay in their poverty track because of their low income entitlement, the low allowable income they can earn and the harshness of the means test which is applied to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In October 1979 the  Australian  reported of scuffles which broke out at the Salvation Army offices at Clayton as 500 men and women lined up for vouchers worth some $30 to buy groceries and other items to feed their <span class="highlight">families</span> because at that time they were not able to get the unemployment benefit as a result of a deliberate policy of the Government to delay payment of the unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should the Government penalise them and their <span class="highlight">families</span> when they are already well and truly penalised by having been stood down? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Families</span> of pensioners are hit particularly hard because the extra allowance granted for each dependant has not increased since 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Families</span> of unemployed people with three or four children and <span class="highlight">families</span> of single parents with three or four children are now almost $30 below the poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have been brought up in good homes, so to speak, in good <span class="highlight">families</span>, reasonably affluent <span class="highlight">families</span>, in which a fairly strong line of discipline has been exercised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in addition to compensating <span class="highlight">families</span> for the erosion of family allowances that has taken place the allowances should be taken out of politics and indexed every six months to avoid the difficulties that are being experienced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the Government is going to be in trouble if it does not do anything about the economic difficulties and pressures on <span class="highlight">families</span> in this day and age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there had been indexation of the previous scheme there would have been a substantial improvement in the financial lot of <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the problems in the areas of social welfare and health stem from the fact that <span class="highlight">families</span> are under economic pressure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the family allowance to higher income <span class="highlight">families</span> was limited, and a family income supplement was paid to lower income and larger <span class="highlight">families</span> on the basis of family size and income, the distribution of such funds would be directed to those in need, and therefore do most good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one would argue with that proposition but it may be serious news to those who are receiving the present family allowances that those allowances will be limited for some people and that there may be a family income supplement on a means tested basis for other <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the putting down of an amendment provides a good opportunity to express to the Australian people what the policy is, how this compensation for erosion by inflation would be interpreted, and whether it would be interpreted to cover all <span class="highlight">families</span> and all children at a cost of $330m in a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to  Senator Harradine  that whilst it may provide some compensation to <span class="highlight">families</span> to receive more in the way of family allowances, if as a result of those increased allowances a higher level of taxation is imposed on those <span class="highlight">families</span> who are struggling to support themselves, this may be counter-productive and not the best way in which to assist them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to support in our society the concept of extensive home ownership we need to see that the taxation of people’s incomes is not at such a level that it is made extremely difficult for people to buy homes for themselves and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst it is said that family allowances have not been increased, in social security matters we still draw attention to the fact that family allowances go to the lowest income <span class="highlight">families</span> who did not benefit from the previous scheme of tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst it might be an argument to talk about giving an additional benefit to the lowest income <span class="highlight">families</span>, I think there would be general alarm if this were done at the expense of other <span class="highlight">families</span> who have received family allowances for some years now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The tables which were incorporated in  Hansard  by  Senator Grimes  show the disposable incomes of various types of low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and compare them with the Henderson poverty line figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My main objective would be to see what, in present day terms and conditions, ought to be the line by which we would judge <span class="highlight">families</span> in need in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have acknowledged that there are difficulties for many <span class="highlight">families</span> with a number of dependent children, who have an income either from social security or from one wage earner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Chipp  drew attention to some <span class="highlight">families</span> which are almost $30 a week below the poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He referred to the economic pressure on <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we all acknowledge that that exists, particularly if we look at the level of taxation which we impose on the <span class="highlight">families</span> concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, in their case, pan of the cost of their education at tertiary level comes from Consolidated Revenue contributed in pan through tax by their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No such contribution is made by overseas students or their <span class="highlight">families</span> although many are well able to afford such costs and, indeed, would have to pay fees if the student undertook higher education in the home country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australian students do not pay fees, but funds for their education come from our Consolidated Revenue, which comes from the tax paid by their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 am of the view that those charges will not deter overseas students who are able to pay and whose <span class="highlight">families</span> are able to pay those charges from undertaking studies in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It must be the effect of charging an extra $1,500 to $2,000 a year for undergraduate courses and $2,500 for postgraduate courses on top of the $3,500 to $4,000 a year which <span class="highlight">families</span> and community groups in <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To find an extra $1,500 to $2,500 will put education beyond the limits of certain <span class="highlight">families</span> and community groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, not only will this Bill put education beyond the reach of the helping sustenance of <span class="highlight">families</span> and groups in the communities that the students come from but also it will put certain Australian community aid groups in a position where they cannot offer as much assistance and as much help as they did previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In order to obtain $5m or $6m in revenue this legislation proposes to deny us the possibility of aiding the moderately wealthy <span class="highlight">families</span> of the Pacific and South East Asia from sending their youth to Australia who upon their return will be in positions of influence in the decision-making processes in commerce, industry and public life in their home country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is that all governments have based the TEAS allowance on the concept that it is not to provide total support at all but is to be supplemented either by <span class="highlight">families</span>- the normal way- and/or by incomes derived elsewhere by students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My experience as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has already brought home to me the enormous range of problems facing Australia’s 800 or more Aboriginal communities- and those numerous <span class="highlight">families</span> who live in urban areas but cannot be identified as members of a particular community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The decline in real living standards of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> will be seen as a factor in the upsurge in the demand for a change in the stupid, wasteful boom and bust system- the on and off, give and take away promises and hedge system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government policy which is making it so much harder for Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> to maintain their living standards on their present wages is that which brought about the added cost of health insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I was saying, there is concern amongst the Timorese people because <span class="highlight">families</span> have been fragmented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be good enough for the Government to keep the Parliament sitting after 10.30 p.m., but I do not think it is good enough to keep all these officers away from their <span class="highlight">families</span> until late at night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so, will he assure the Senate that the Government will take whatever action is possible to prevent the introduction of market rents and escalating interest rates within the Commission so as to ensure the maintenance of low cost Commission housing for those <span class="highlight">families</span> and individuals on low and moderate incomes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  advise the Committee where in these estimates money is provided for the type of in-depth survey which would indicate the structure of the work force and provide the opinions of a proper sampling of the work force in the categories I have mentioned, upon which information certain fiscal policies could be based which would overcome a significant part of the present unemployment  problem and which also would provide necessary relief from economic pressures on <span class="highlight">families</span> in this day and age? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One group which was mentioned earlier tonight comprises those <span class="highlight">families</span> in the community who, because they rely on social security benefits or are in the low income bracket, remain well below the poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple facts of the matter are that in this country large <span class="highlight">families</span> relying on unemployment or other social security benefits or receiving low incomes remain below the poverty level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only means we have in this country of redistributing income to those <span class="highlight">families</span> under the current legislation is through the family allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This scheme was introduced in 1976 to replace the previous tax rebates for <span class="highlight">families</span> and the previous child endowment scheme which had become so eroded by inflation as to be almost meaningless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An alternative method of assisting these <span class="highlight">families</span> could be through the taxation system, but we have a taxation system which is so complex and so difficult to amend that in the short term I believe that reform in this area to achieve significant benefits for poor people, particularly low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, would be impossible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any proposal for income splitting- this is obvious to anyone who looks at it- will benefit most those on high incomes and least those single parent <span class="highlight">families</span> who have no one to split their income with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will benefit the low income <span class="highlight">families</span> very little because their income is so low that they are paying very little tax now and will pay very little less tax with such an income splitting proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the family allowance scheme which I believe we can reform quickly and reasonably to redirect funds to low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But even if they had been indexed under the present system across the board through all income levels, the increase in family allowances to the high income <span class="highlight">families</span> would be meaningless because of their incomes and the increase in income to the low income <span class="highlight">families</span> would have been inadequate to raise their income sufficiently to get them anywhere near the poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to use the family allowances scheme we must look, I believe, at methods of redirecting some of the increased payments under that scheme to the low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the bulk of that money should be directed to low income <span class="highlight">families</span> whether or not they are on benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot do it by simple across the board indexation to all <span class="highlight">families</span> with children in the community whether or not they are in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister how she can justify introducing a scheme like that in 1976 with such a fanfare and with such claims of assistance to low income <span class="highlight">families</span> in the community and then leave payments at the same level they had been at since 1 976 and allow them to be eroded by 36 per cent or 40 per cent inflation without any justification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a family income support scheme cannot be introduced which directs funds to low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, certainly we should at least introduce indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that some <span class="highlight">families</span>, particularly one-income <span class="highlight">families</span>, are beginning to wake up to the fact that they are receiving very little incentive or encouragement from governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">families</span> have noted the disappearance of the maternity allowance, the 35 per cent erosion in the real value of family allowance payments, and the way in which they are regularly catapulted into higher taxation brackets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that unless a serious look is taken at the manner in which we are supporting low income <span class="highlight">families</span> in the community generally and avoid the sort of bland reply that we got from the Minister we will get nowhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge the Government to look at the problem seriously because low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, particularly those with a working parent, are in fact becoming those who are left out of our social security and our general system of income support in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are administrative procedures in the Department delaying the handing over of houses and flats to Asian refugees to the extent that: (a) community groups frequently are denied advice of when houses and flats will become available until the last moment; and (b) the Department is reluctant to hand over the keys to government houses and flats so that responsible community groups can put the dwellings in order before refugee <span class="highlight">families</span> arrive in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-127-5">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stress that the real problem facing single income <span class="highlight">families</span> earning up to 1 35 per cent of average weekly earnings whether they live in Sydney or Melbourne is that they are the victims of an almost impossible system when it comes to acquiring a home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
