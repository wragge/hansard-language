<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister agree that this state of affairs represents a desperate situation to the parents of these unfortunate children and other members of their <span class="highlight">families</span> and places a tremendous strain on the health of the parents caring for the retarded? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister consider this to be just in view of the fact that these houses are tied to Commonwealth Railways employment, that the employees have to vacate the houses on retirement and that <span class="highlight">families</span> have to vacate them in the event of the death of an employee? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The total increase in contributions resulting from the contribution adjustments made is estimated to be $20.4m a year, lt was also decided to further, liberalise the Subsidised Medical Services Scheme which, since 1st January 1970, has provided full insurance coverage for persons in receipt of unemployment and sickness benefits, newly arrived migrants and <span class="highlight">families</span> whose incomes did not exceed $39.00 per week (since amended to $42.50 per week). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation passed by Parliament in June 1970 extended this Scheme so that <span class="highlight">families</span> whose income do not exceed $48.50 per week need to meet only a portion of normal health insurance contributions to insurance organisations to be covered for their hospital and medical expenses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should not like this occasion to pass without registering on behalf of my Party, the Australian Country Party, that we wish to join with the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  and the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  in the expression of deep concern and deep sympathy in respect of those who have lost their lives, those who have suffered, and in particular the <span class="highlight">families</span> and relatives of the men involved in this tragedy, and at least to have the survivors and dependants understand that all Parties in the Commonwealth Parliament have expressed deep distress and sympathy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the present taxes on birth control devices are not in Australia’s long-term population interests and that, in addition, they discriminate against poor people and their right to limit the size of their own <span class="highlight">families</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The serious decline in social services has intensified the hardships faced by pensioners and <span class="highlight">families</span> on lower incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think this is well understood, and further I think the practice of Ministers bringing their <span class="highlight">families</span> to Canberra and establishing homes here is welcomed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister for the Army, subsequent to his assurance that all troops will be home from Vietnam for Christmas, and bearing in mind that some Western Australian servicemen have been advised that they will have to travel from Townsville in Queensland to Western Australia by train and that they will arrive in Western Australia after Christmas, either arrange earlier departure dates from Townsville to ensure that Western Australian servicemen arrive home for Christmas or arrange air transport so that <span class="highlight">families</span> and servicemen will not be disappointed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the cost involved in moving themselves, their <span class="highlight">families</span> and their belongings to a new place of residence an allowable deduction for income tax purposes to farmers, farm workers, miners and other people in rural or gold-mining areas who because of the critical situation in those fields have been or will be in the future forced to move elsewhere to obtain employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-17">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am of the opinion, rightly or wrongly, that in the past some judgments in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission have been given by men who themselves, their spouses or other members of their <span class="highlight">families</span> have been shareholders in an interested party to the award. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As Army staffs are heavily committed to their military tasks, I do not propose to authorise the extensive and time consuming survey which would be required to obtain the information sought by the honourable member from over two thousand Army <span class="highlight">families</span> in the Holsworthy/ Ingleburn area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-59-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Treasurer agree that the interest rate increases, wherever they may finish, will lift the cost of living to <span class="highlight">families</span> by $5 to $10 a week by increased mortgage repayments, increased hire purchase repayments and increased prices because of the increased cost of borrowing money incurred by the manufacturers of goods or the builders of homes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will facilitate family reunion, as in the past for financial reasons some Yugoslavs preceded their <span class="highlight">families</span> here, lt will avoid the social consequences of separated <span class="highlight">families</span> in future migration and, by easing the financial strain of migration, strengthen and speed successful settlement in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They pointed out also that as a number of Aboriginals with large <span class="highlight">families</span> would receive from $20 to $30 per week in unemployment benefits, they could not understand why the Government did not make up the difference to at least the basic wage of $42.30 and ensure that Aboriginals had full employment opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With a lack of classrooms, classes larger than the experts recommend, a shortage of teachers, a drift away from Australia of some of our best teachers - attracted overseas by more equitable wages and conditions - we are again disappointed to see that despite the anxiety of the electorate no proper provision for relief in the education field in basic matters affecting all <span class="highlight">families</span> is mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government persists with this idea of excluding them on school holidays and public holidays it will break up <span class="highlight">families</span> and where pensioners would normally be able to go for a. holiday with their <span class="highlight">families</span>, because of the increased cost they may have to have second thoughts on the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Furthermore, if the Government had had a responsible anticipation in this matter, which concerns not only thousands of Australian men in Vietnam but also <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia and the whole standing of this country, then better preparation would have been given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An example of others is the loss of understanding that often develops between migrant <span class="highlight">families</span> and their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This deduction, coupled with the assistance given to low income <span class="highlight">families</span> who pay their insurance premiums, produces this situation: People on below $42.50 a week get Government assistance to pay all their health insurance premiums; people on less than $45.50 a week and more than $61.50 a week get two-thirds of their insurance premiums paid for them; people on less than $48.50 a week and more than $70 a week get one-third of their insurance premiums paid for them; and the people in the middle - that is those on between $48.50 and $70 a week - get least. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, the concluding portions of the second reading speech of the Minister for Health  (Dr Forbes),  when he mentioned the position of low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, bring home to us some of these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result of the increase in the Commonwealth minimum weekly wage in December 1969 it is proposed to increase the eligibility level for full health insurance for low income <span class="highlight">families</span> to $42.50 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Speaker, I make this point as I made  it  earlier: I sincerely hope that this Government will look more carefully, more in conscience, wilh some humility and humanity at this issue of providing homes for our younger people so that they may bring up decent young Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> to live a normal existence in a normal atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The elderly people I speak of are mainly those who reared their <span class="highlight">families</span> during the depression years; who, because of circumstances beyond their control, fought every inch of the way for years in order to feed, clothe and educate their children in a world that at that time was sick with poverty; who, many times denied themselves food so that their children could eat: who would have given anything within their power to have owned their own homes; and who worked 44, 48 and more hours a week at their jobs to earn a meagre living - and when I say worked, I mean worked, not just filled in the hours, because at that time there were 6 men ready to fill 4 men’s jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The prime objective has been to encourage regional development of social services throughout the State so that services for handicapped children are located where the children’s <span class="highlight">families</span> are living or to assist within the immediate region so that family involvement can be maintained with the needs of the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are dealing with children and with the <span class="highlight">families</span> of children who suffer enough because of their handicaps without having an additional financial burden with which to contend, or the addi tional concern that the children are receiving something less than the best attention possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that the problem and the responsibility have rested upon the <span class="highlight">families</span> of people who have been handicapped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the latter half of his speech the Minister expressed his sentiments about the <span class="highlight">families</span> of handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that his sentiments are very real but people with handicapped children or handicapped relatives say that eloquent words are of little help to (heir <span class="highlight">families</span> or to the handicapped children and do nothing to assist them at the greatest point of need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They represent a desperate situation for many <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The burdens carried by these <span class="highlight">families</span> include high medical costs, high transport costs, special safety measures in the home, excessive laundry costs, costs of excessive clothing replacements and other excessive costs which may be incurred by the condition of a particular child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the need for residential accommodation for these people is very great, lt could be lessened if a range of community services were available to help these <span class="highlight">families</span> to keep a child at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suggest that Commonwealth bursaries should be made available for student social workers to encourage them to work with <span class="highlight">families</span> which have handicapped, particularly mentally handicapped, children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say without fear of contradiction that any further responsibility placed on parents associations, other voluntary bodies and local government bodies and on the shoulders of the <span class="highlight">families</span> of these unfortunate handicapped people is only a vicious form of indirect taxation on a section of the public which is now bearing much more than its share of Commonwealth responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me that the key word for <span class="highlight">families</span> who have to make the decision I have mentioned is hope’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any measure, therefore, to alleviate these burdens will be welcomed by the <span class="highlight">families</span> concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am not prepared to stand here and say that the Minister has failed totally in his obligations and that he should bring down a Bill now to cover, in a blanket sort of way, all the deficiencies we have experienced over the years, but he should, out of his sense of responsibility, require his Department to work forthrightly and objectively towards identification of the problem and he should be prepared to say that over a period of years we are going to relieve these unfortunate <span class="highlight">families</span> of this depressing and pressing obligation to which they have been subjected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However; one thing is certain and that is that there should be tax relief for these <span class="highlight">families</span>; there should be special equipment; there should be a more personalised approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I feel that the primary producers, particularly the dairy farmers and their <span class="highlight">families</span> in marginal areas, are so entrenched in dairy production, which is their way of life, that even with this voluntary system it will be very difficult to entice many of them from their farms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-29-55">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps I could point mit the Government’s attitude by saying that the Act at present provides for low income <span class="highlight">families</span> to be assisted with the cost of contributing for medical and hospital benefits and, as honourable members ure aware, the Natonal Health Bill proposes extensions to this assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bases of assessing eligibility are weekly income for <span class="highlight">families</span> below pensionable age and ‘means as assessed’ for <span class="highlight">families</span> of pensionable age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The National Health Act, however, provides for these forms of income to be included when calculating the ‘means as assessed’ for low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment would have the effect of providing that, for <span class="highlight">families</span> over pensionable age, eligibility would be based on means as assessed identical with that applied under the Social Services Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the income falling within the categories I have listed above were excluded when assessing eligibility, then it would place the recipient of the income in an advantageous position as compared with other <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the amendment would involve only a small increase in the cost of providing assistance to low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, the Government rejects the amendment on the grounds that it would introduce a number of anomalies as between <span class="highlight">families</span> in similar financial circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, the Minister for Health  (Dr Forbes)  in his statement said that because these gentlemen, who are directors of the funds, give very substantial time in a voluntary capacity to them - no one will deny that perhaps they do give substantial time in a voluntary capacity - it would be an unfair intrusion into their private affairs to expect their holdings, or those of their <span class="highlight">families</span>, in any organisation in which the fund’s reserves have been invested to be revealed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She has also discussed this with a number of State Ministers and, following on these discussions, has reached the conclusion that this is a matter for the States, several of which are actively engaged in land development and have introduced schemes to keep the price of newly developed land as low as possible to young <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700821_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of informal discussions with the States it has become apparent that the States wish to experiment with new types of estate development which would include, in addition to the building of cottages, the building of a number of terrace houses and groups of cluster housing as well as modest high rise buildings for single persons and <span class="highlight">families</span> without children in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700821_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the discussions which are taking place between the Commonwealth Minister for Housing and the State Ministers for Housing will reveal that the people who need urgent assistance, who need to be given preference in obtaining homes, are those in the low wage bracket and with large <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700821_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, we have reached the stage where the only consideration in relation to housing which is evident in Government policy is how much money will be spent on it; how much interest will be charged; and how much can be extracted from young <span class="highlight">families</span> in order to meet repayments over ever-extending periods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700821_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the average and below average wage earner, especially those with <span class="highlight">families</span>, the new imposts will more than cancel out any temporary cash gain through income tax reduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the conclusion is clear and it is this: Seventy per cent of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> are worse off because of the direct and immediate consequences of this Budget, and the poorer a family is, the worse it is affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second aspect of the complaint is that the problem can be evaded if there is not a progressive system of taxation, lt can be evaded if there is high and increasing indirect rates of taxation which fall on <span class="highlight">families</span> and on working men irrespective of income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is hard to assimilate the purport of these signs as one travels round in such a cursory and superficial way, but in the end it comes down to the fact that people will be affected in hospital, that children will be distracted from their efforts to gain an education, that <span class="highlight">families</span> will be unable to watch television without interruption, that radio reception will be interfered with, that telephone conversations will be impaired, that shiftworkers will be unable to sleep and that other factors of this type will be involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People with large <span class="highlight">families</span> and low incomes who now do not pay any income tax cannot gain any relief from that quarter and they will be obliged to face up to these increased charges, to the additional sales tax and excise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to return briefly to the subject of taxation in order to draw attention to the fact that the Government has once again, as it has for so many years, refused to make any alteration in zone allowances or in zone boundaries despite the fact, which must be obvious to everyone, that under existing allowances and boundaries a number of taxpayers and their <span class="highlight">families</span> in remote and far flung areas are being treated in a most unfair manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If it is considered that these <span class="highlight">families</span> can exist or even subsist on an increase of 50c in their living allowance, I would like some honourable member on the Government side to stand up in this place and tell me the standard at which he expects such <span class="highlight">families</span> to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not a problem which will be easy to solve, but it is one which must be solved in the name of humanity and it must be solved quickly because costs are increasing and the ability of <span class="highlight">families</span> to pay is decreasing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As we are aware, migrants have made a significant contribution to the growth of this country but it is time we looked at our own Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> and did something more positive for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Low income earners and young working class <span class="highlight">families</span> - they constitute a large proportion of the balance of my constituents - who are forced to live 40 or 50 miles from Sydney by the rising price of land near Sydney also have been deeply moved by the Treasurer’s generosity in granting them tax concessions amounting to 75c or $1 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As 1 understand it, the pension was instigated as a supplement to a lifetime of earning and thrift, lt implied that people of a certain age at a certain level of existence would be receiving help from their <span class="highlight">families</span> and relatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the war stopped immediately, in 10 years it will have cost Australia $165m, quite apart from the loss to the work force, the loss in human life and the effect it has had upon the <span class="highlight">families</span> that are left. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I therefore submit that this Government is not interested in promoting young Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> and in removing the necessity for wives to go to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Unless this is done and unless justice is given to all these segments of the community about which I have spoken today - those with <span class="highlight">families</span>, the civilian widow who has so much to look after, the deserted wife, the invalid and age pensioner and these various other sections of our community who need assistance - this Parliament will stand damned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In accordance with my undertaking I will mention briefly that I have been a little disappointed in the last couple of years that the Government has not been able to respond to the situation of widower fathers and deserted fathers on limited incomes supporting <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are mindful of the fact, for instance, that child endowment, maternity allowances, child allowances, wife’s allowances and certain other benefits are very important and necessary for the welfare and reasonable living standard of a large number of <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the inception of the scheme of pensions for the aged and the infirm the concept was to give aid supplementary to that given by the <span class="highlight">families</span> of aged people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We require training in many more skills and the pressure on our education system is attributable largely to the tremendous intake of migrants and migrant <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have seen circumstances in the past where courses of study undertaken by young men, for various reasons - perhaps because of the length of their course of studies, perhaps because of tragedies in their <span class="highlight">families</span> or an inability to continue a course for a year or so, perhaps due to failure in a year - have gone beyond that point where, if they were to continue and complete the course, they would be able to complete their military obligations before reaching 26 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I cannot obviously give a general answer to a particular question of this kind, other than to say that I do not think it accurate to say that there are thousands of <span class="highlight">families</span> who could never be expected to provide a son for service, because where <span class="highlight">families</span> have sons of serviceable age, in all cases those sons have the same chance of being called up as anybody else, unless of course they are deferred as a result of their university studies or unless they decide to take the proper legal course, if they wish to avoid the chance of being called up, of joining the Citizen Military <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Above all, if we want men and their <span class="highlight">families</span> to be happy in the Service we must recognise their preoccupation with the circumstances in which they will find themselves when, at a mature age, they embark on a civilian life, usually in competition with younger breadwinners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To get a family of 6 from Green Valley to the beach or the zoo and back takes most of a day, including half, a day’s travel by car or perhaps 2 days’ wages in’ fares and expenses … 60 per cent of Green Valley’s <span class="highlight">families</span> have no car and 29 per cent have no wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister went on to say that the Government would encourage the construction of better housing for low income <span class="highlight">families</span> who are unable to obtain satisfactory private rental accommodation or who are paying more than they can really afford. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the bead of the list of our national housing aims are encouragement of ‘ the production of more homes, the building of homes specifically for renting to those in need of a decent or cheaper home, and the offer of assistance to low income <span class="highlight">families</span> wishing to own a home of  their  own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have an enormous and increasing number of <span class="highlight">families</span> waiting long periods for homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Requirements were imposed by the Commonwealth which diverted money for housing for low income <span class="highlight">families</span>: 30 per cent of the funds made available was to be diverted to building societies and a further 10 per cent was to provide houses for serving members of the Forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These matters, in my view, needed attention but they should have been attended to without making inroads into the limited housing opportunities available to low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This drift away from the Services can be arrested if full note is taken of the disadvantages suffered by Service personnel by the provision of such things as temporary rental allowances, educational allowances, removal allowances and due compensation for officers and their <span class="highlight">families</span> when they have to move from place to place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All these anti-Vietnam demonstrations, all the howling we hear from the Opposition, all the demonstrations and cries about getting out of Vietnam and of reducing the Services that we hear from the Opposition, including the screaming member from Port Adelaide  (Mr Birrell)  are pressures that are brought to bear upon Service personnel and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The homes and hospitals for the aged are so inadequate and the fees charged in private institutions are so high that an aged or invalid pensioner cannot afford to meet the charges, and <span class="highlight">families</span> are therefore expected to subsidise quite heavily the fees of pensioners in these institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Over a number of years, the Victorian Government, through its Department of Social Welfare, has given assistance to <span class="highlight">families</span> receiving Commonwealth pensions, such as widow’s pensions and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These people are being asked to leave some of the private homes if they do not have assistance from their <span class="highlight">families</span> because they cannot afford to meet the costs when the only income is the pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that <span class="highlight">families</span> such as those of migrants with 4 or 5 children, deserted wives, widows and deserted widowers with dependent children are the ones who are seriously affected in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This would help to give them more incentive to remain in employment, to give their children something better to come home to, to give them the opportunity to come home to <span class="highlight">families</span> of which the father is in employment and is able to feed them well and therefore make them healthier, stronger and more resistant to disease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, if one considers total farm labour costs, which include the labour costs of the owner or owners and his or their <span class="highlight">families</span>, of share farmers and what have you, the increase in the price of a bushel of wheat would be not 2c but 6c. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some more fortunate than others may find emergency temporary camping with a relative or friend who has a home, but it can only be called camping because Aboriginals usually have large <span class="highlight">families</span> and those already living in a house arc living often in sub-standard conditions, leaving only verandahs and outhouses for the visitors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In determining the appropriate content for the social welfare programme one of the greatest difficulties is to decide how much emphasis should be placed on meeting the needs of individuals and <span class="highlight">families</span> in trouble and how much to place on overall schemes which improve the standard of living of the whole community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has certainly granted increases in child endowment to <span class="highlight">families</span> with more than 2 children but this increase can be completely absorbed by increased pharmaceutical benefit charges when sickness strikes, so it is another case of the Government giving with one hand and taking with the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the concurrence of honourable members I incorporate in Hansard the following table which sets out the weekly rates that will be payable for <span class="highlight">families</span> of different sizes: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker, the child endowment increases in the Bill will, as I have said, benefit more than one million children, spread in more than 600,000 <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increases I have just outlined will help ease the financial stress facing many <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assistance is given to <span class="highlight">families</span> via the National Health Act where the family insurance rates for a family with children - however many children - are pegged at the rate applicable to a married couple without children; special assistance is also provided for handicapped children and children of pensioners, the last a matter which I shall deal with more fully in a moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many social workers have drawn attention to the special hardship suffered by what are called one parent <span class="highlight">families</span> and by <span class="highlight">families</span> where the breadwinner is incapacitated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget, as I have said, is especially oriented towards the needs of dependent children, particularly towards the needs of children in deprived <span class="highlight">families</span>, where bereavement or invalidity has struck. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would bring about a situation where they were away from their <span class="highlight">families</span> on only Tuesday evening and Wednesday evening and would be back in their offices first thing Friday morning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How many married <span class="highlight">families</span> are living in single Government accommodation and is it intended to transfer any or all of these persons to Government houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was considered in view of other pressing demands on government construction funds, especially for houses to provide family accommodation, that available resources should be directed more towards meeting the pressing needs of <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Provision to increase child endowment for third and subsequent children in <span class="highlight">families</span> and for children in institutions by 50c per week is contained in the Social Services Bill before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-35-9">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">families</span> are desperately in need of health and hygiene education and education on family planning, ft has been reported that 50 per cent of Aboriginal children are under the age of 15 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span> would remain in their own districts and would not have to travel with their children many miles from home to Alice Springs or some other hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now wish to refer to another aspect of the Budget which aims a further disastrous blow at Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concessional deductions should at least not be used to discourage people from having <span class="highlight">families</span>, as they appear to do at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has extended some small measure of benefit to <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also a matter of lifelong maiming, suffering and poverty for lots of <span class="highlight">families</span> because this is the main cause of people being in wheelchairs and living a stunted and withered remnant of a life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister state the number of people in each State and Territory in each of the categories of (a) unemployed, (b) migrants, (c) sickness beneficiaries, (d) other eligible beneficiaries and (e) <span class="highlight">families</span> with weekly incomes of (i) below $42.50, (ii) between $42.45 and $45.50 and (iii) between $45.50 and $48.50, who have applied for subsidised health insurance by registering with (A) the Commonwealth Department of Social Services and (B) a hospital and medical benefits society since the introduction of the subsidised medical services scheme? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Families</span> with less than $46.50 a week qualify for a full subsidy on hospital and medical benefits costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would estimate that there are tens of thousands of low income <span class="highlight">families</span> who are eligible for assistance under the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For one thing, a lot of the <span class="highlight">families</span> in the community which are eligible for this assistance simply do not know it is there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purely mechanical means of increasing the publicity through the mass media is not, I am sure, going to get through to the tens of thousands of <span class="highlight">families</span> in such situations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I asked the statistical research service to examine what would be the poverty level according to the sizes of <span class="highlight">families</span> on the standards laid down by the Department of Applied Economic Research, which is Professor Henderson’s department, at the University of Melbourne, using the criteria that it used in a survey of poverty in 1966. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the dropping out of employment of married women would not show up in the figures of the recipients of benefits it would very seriously affect the economy of the area and of the <span class="highlight">families</span> concerned because the income of these women has become a part of the normal income of the family and the spending rates and standards of living have been geared accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are these people turning now in greater numbers to register with State housing authorities to enable them to secure homes in which to rear <span class="highlight">families</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Coming back to the substantial increase of $2 in child allowance, no doubt all honourable members have had experience with one-parent <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many parents in this category have had great difficulty in providing for their young <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Socially I believe the right place for them is in the home of their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we become more affluent we seem to care less not only for people in needy circumstances but, as I have said before in this House, also for members of our own <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure this was not the case pre-war when members of large <span class="highlight">families</span> were prepared to share their possessions with a genuine concern for those in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe what they also seek no government can provide - that is love and understanding from members of their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, I repeat that no government should be expected to take over the entire responsibility of caring for those in need while members of their <span class="highlight">families</span> contribute little to their welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Child endowment is designed to help the family - to encourage Australians to have larger <span class="highlight">families</span> and to populate our country with the best migrants we can have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is beyond question that rising costs hit, first, the pensioners, the sick, the old, the low income earners and the people with large <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the increases in this legislation, 85 per cent of endowed <span class="highlight">families</span>, that is, in the first child and 2 children categories, will not receive any increase at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Commonwealth statistics show, those <span class="highlight">families</span> in the lower income brackets have the highest number of children, but many parents today are hesitant about having larger <span class="highlight">families</span> simply because they cannot afford to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this side of the House we have always believed that particular help should be given to <span class="highlight">families</span> with children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assistance to one-parent <span class="highlight">families</span> ranks very high in Government priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The special attention that is being given to assistance to <span class="highlight">families</span> with children stands as a key feature of the social services programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally enough, some of the immigrants who come here, after staying for a number of years and qualifying for an Australian pension by living here and paying taxes as good citizens, might decide to go home and live with their <span class="highlight">families</span> in their years of retirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pensioners in the main are people who have helped develop this country, paid their taxes, reared their <span class="highlight">families</span> and in their years of retirement, are entitled to social services pensions to provide them for their needs and requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The increase in child endowment will cost about $26,500,000 and will benefit 1,020,000 children in about 610,000 <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In many cases aged parents are cared for in nursing homes away from their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it would be well, received by the people and <span class="highlight">families</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These increases will help to ease the financial burden faced by many <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Assistance is given to <span class="highlight">families</span> through the National Health Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even where increases are given, such as in endowment for <span class="highlight">families</span> of 3 or more children, a very large part, if not all, of that increase will be regathered by the Treasury through increased charges imposed by the Government upon several articles which the majority of <span class="highlight">families</span> find necessary to purchase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very people for whom the Government pretends concern, the largs <span class="highlight">families</span>, will be hit the hardest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that parents with large <span class="highlight">families</span> are not being assisted to the extent that they should be and that in turn the whole family is suffering in the areas of health and education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some <span class="highlight">families</span> on farms have other business interests and wool growing is only a sideline for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The examples that I have given deal with the big majority of <span class="highlight">families</span>, because 75 per cent of all <span class="highlight">families</span> have less than 4 children, leaving 25 per cent with 4 children or more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely there is some justification for doing something for the <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think that that in itself is sufficient evidence to deal with the Minister’s claims that <span class="highlight">families</span> and pensioners are better off today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also true to say that in most oases the children of pensioners are forced to leave school at an earlier age, unless they are extremely lucky, because of the incomes of their <span class="highlight">families</span> and the economic circumstances in which they find themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In looking at policies relating to age pensions, <span class="highlight">families</span> and endowment the Opposition has completely ignored that aspect of consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not like to have any <span class="highlight">families</span> existing at a povery level, just as nobody wants to have even 0.1 per cent of people unemployed, but where performance has been good it ought to be recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is due to a much higher minimum wage which lifts nearly all earners’ <span class="highlight">families</span> out of poverty as well as rather more generous pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this is well understood, and further I think the practice of Ministers bringing their <span class="highlight">families</span> to Canberra and establishing homes here is welcomed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710910_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That town housing must be provided for all Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span> where the bread winner has permanent employment or an age or invalid pension entitlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-1-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister whether the policy document which he has sought on the subject of ministerial accommodation in Canberra will cover the suggestion that Ministers whose duties require them to live in Canberra with their <span class="highlight">families</span>, as clearly a Minister for the Interior must, should be able to have accommodation in Canberra during the term of their office as Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does he realise the position of these men and their <span class="highlight">families</span> in having to sacrifice their homes at forced-to-sell prices so that they can purchase homes, if possible, at their new destinations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is my belief that the millions of people who belong to trade unions in Australia are responsible people, people whose major interests in life are to provide themselves and their <span class="highlight">families</span> with a decent standard of living and to live at peace with the community, without taking a very active part in politics - most trade unionists do not take a very active part in politics - without making excessive demands on the community but expecting from the community that which they have a right to expect in a society with a standard of living as high as the Australian society has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We think the scheme should include not just farmers, the <span class="highlight">families</span> of farmers and the work force on those particular farms or those people affected by technology, but also people who work in country towns and are out of work because of the problems in the rural areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The subsidised health benefits plan which has been in existence since January 1970 provides assistance, in meeting the cost of medical and hospital treatment, to persons receiving unemployment, sickness and special social service benefits, to migrants during their first 2 months in Australia and to low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the same way such fiscal or budgetary policies as large domestic budget surpluses, such as the one planned in this Budget of $630m, the siphoning off of funds from the community by higher personal and company taxes and by higher charges for such items as postal and telephone services, broadcast and television licences, petrol and other fuels, the doubling of the patient’s charge for pharmaceutical benefits from 50c to $1 - a wicked charge for so many, particularly young <span class="highlight">families</span> on lower incomes and in many cases large young <span class="highlight">families</span> at that - are but some examples of the methods of this Government in this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Department lifts 42 <span class="highlight">families</span> from Cairns and sends them to Townsville this will disrupt those 42 <span class="highlight">families</span> and make a big difference to the income and economy of the Cairns area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government will have to pay for them to come back into the Cairns area to do the design and engineering work that will be necessary,  and it will cost  the Government a damn sight more than it will cost to shift these <span class="highlight">families</span> to Townsville. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In respect of low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, there was only one category of beneficiary when the Scheme commenced operation on 1st January 1970, viz., <span class="highlight">families</span> whose gross weekly income did not exceed $39 per week, a figure which at that time approximated the average minimum weekly wage payable under Commonwealth awards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As from 1st July 1970, the National Health Act was amended by extending this assistance, on a graduated scale, to low income <span class="highlight">families</span> whose gross weekly income did not exceed $48.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eligible <span class="highlight">families</span> were divided into three categories, viz.. Class A, Class B, and Class C. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only necessary for low income <span class="highlight">families</span> to make application to the Department of Social Services for assessment of their eligibility for assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is he now able to explain the almost total failure of this scheme as shown by figures indicating that only 7 per cent, or 13,000 out of the estimated 184,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> eligible for assistance under this scheme, have been approved by the Department of Social Services and that about only half of this number have been registered with a benefits organisation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What steps has he in train to ensure that all people who are eligible for assistance do so benefit especially as roughly 84,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> earning between $46.50 and $52.50 must be in the scheme for 2 months to benefit? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, as the means test at present victimises large <span class="highlight">families</span> who need a larger income to be above the poverty line than the means test allows, will he broaden the means test to take account of differing incomes needed for differing family sizes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The figures did show that under the category of low income <span class="highlight">families</span> only 11,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> were listed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The information I have been given shows that the figure we should be looking at for an indication of the coverage of the scheme is not 11,000 low income <span class="highlight">families</span> but in fact the 84,000 people who receive benefit which, as I think the honourable gentleman will agree, presents an entirely different picture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is unjustifiable on economic grounds, on the ground of the suffering it causes to people, on the ground that it takes from our nation men who are in the position where they can use their newly attained skills in trades and professions and on the ground of the suffering it brings to the few <span class="highlight">families</span> that are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For tens of thousands of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> it could have helped to provide a break in the poverty cycle in which low income, poor housing, poor diet arid poor hygiene are passed on from parents to children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of over 100,000 migrant <span class="highlight">families</span> and individuals who arrived in Australia in 1970, only about 27,000, or 1 in 4, applied for registration with a health benefits organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Figures given in 1969 and 1970 by the former Minister for Health - the present Minister for Immigration  (Dr Forbes)  - who introduced this scheme indicated that there were approximately 184,000 specifically low income <span class="highlight">families</span> living on the minimum wage or $6 above it - these figures are in black and white - who would have been entitled to full or partial subsidy for the cost of health insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Little wonder, then, that in answering a question last Tuesday, he fell back on the claim that the number of low income <span class="highlight">families</span> receiving benefit under the scheme was not in fact 13,000; instead he said it was 84,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These include migrants, <span class="highlight">families</span> on a specifically low income and people receiving unemployment, sickness or special benefit from the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we can see that the figure which the Minister used in claiming that there were 84,000 low income <span class="highlight">families</span> inflates the success of the scheme by about 300 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One expects that a scheme aimed at protecting low income <span class="highlight">families</span> would be for a long term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us consider those who are specifically low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, who receive the minimum wage or up to $6 more than that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we find from page 64 of the report of the Department of Social Services that 57 per cent of all the <span class="highlight">families</span> in the categories of class A, class B and class C had been enrolled in the subsidised local scheme for more than 6 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us dispel the cloud of confusion that the Ministers have deliberately thrown around the claim that the 84,000 supposedly included within their scheme are’ actually low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For one thing, using the Government’s suggestion that two-thirds of those enrolled in benefits organisations- are low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and individuals, then of all the 300,000 applications passed by the Commonwealth Government last year as eligible for assistance, probably 200,000 should have been chronically low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that were the case, the number registered in 1970 as specifically low income <span class="highlight">families</span> should not have been 13,000 but a far greater figure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing that is most disturbing is the very small number of <span class="highlight">families</span> led by adult male wage earners that are covered in this scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At 30th June this year there were probably no more than 2,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> led by male wage earners in this subsidised scheme, in the class A, class B and class C system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interesting thing about the group of people in the less than $46.50 a week income bracket who have registered is, as the Department of Social Services report indicates, that 6 out of 10 <span class="highlight">families</span> registered are <span class="highlight">families</span> led by women and, in particular, by deserted wives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member criticised, amongst  Other  things, the  low  income benefits and referred, as the basis  for  authority for his comments, to recent Press statements which alleged that because by 31st December 1970 only about 12,000 low income <span class="highlight">families</span> had applied for assistance under the subsidised health benefits plan, which was introduced on 1st January last year, the plan had failed in its objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are, firstly, the low income <span class="highlight">families</span>; secondly, unemployment, sickness and special beneficiaries; and, thirdly, migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A high proportion of the persons receiving unemployment, sickness and special benefits would receive annual incomes less than the annual limit of income which determines eligibility for low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the year ended 30th June 1971, 82,000 unemployment, sickness and special beneficiaries became members of health insurance funds, about 11,000 low income <span class="highlight">families</span> became members and about 28,000 migrants became members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The total of the 3 groups approximates 121,000. lt is estimated that 84,000 of these consist of <span class="highlight">families</span> on low incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also relevant that the original estimate was that 184,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> would become eligible for health insurance assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Projections based on figures for the 1968-69 income year, which are now available, indicate that by now the maximum number of eligible low income <span class="highlight">families</span> is approximately 125,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new procedures involve the introduction of a simplified application form of low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and the adoption of one certificate for all beneficiaries, whether low income <span class="highlight">families</span> or unemployment, sickness or special beneficiaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think I would be performing a useful- and factual - service if 1 were briefly to outline certain aspects of the health benefits plan as they apply to low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, to those receiving unemployment, sickness or special benefits, and to migrant settlers for medical or hospital expenses incurred during the first 2 months in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2550 which was supplied to the honourable member for Bendigo shows that this figure of 11,000 can be quite grievously misleading, lt represents double counting, because when one looks at the breakup of membership of health insurance organisations for low income <span class="highlight">families</span> one finds that it is a total figure covering people registered, in the first place, for medical insurance and, in the second place, for hospital insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In each case, for instance under class A, only a little over 5,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> are registered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So what in fact has happened is that the Government has lumped a little over 5,000 together twice and said that this is 11,000 <span class="highlight">families</span>, but in fact this is double counting and it is fairly obvious that the <span class="highlight">families</span> drawing on low income medical insurance are the same <span class="highlight">families</span> appearing under hospital insurance claims, and similarly for the other groups - the migrant groups and the unemployment and sickness beneficiaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fewer than 4 <span class="highlight">families</span> out of every 100 low income <span class="highlight">families</span> entitled to draw on this scheme have done so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a cost in 1970-71 of about $4.6m, Labor’s scheme would fully meet the cost of all contributions for all low income <span class="highlight">families</span> with one or more dependants on a taxable income of up to $1,730. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor’s scheme will cost about one-third of the Government’s scheme for subsidised health insurance, but it will cover nearly twice as many <span class="highlight">families</span> - about 325,000 <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Low-income <span class="highlight">families</span> make application to the Department of Social Services where eligibility is assessed and a certificate issued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I accept that many of the low-income <span class="highlight">families</span> are poorly educated and some must perhaps be helped in taking these steps, but this is much better than converting it into another government handout. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the graduated scheme was introduced in July 1970 it was estimated that 184,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> would be eligible for assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures represented the maximum number of lowincome <span class="highlight">families</span> which could become eligible for the assistance available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Families</span> in that State, therefore, would not need to enrol under the subsidised health benefits plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would reduce the estimated number of eligible <span class="highlight">families</span> to about 110,000 instead of 180,000 as mentioned by the honourable member for Bendigo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is probable that a large number of eligible <span class="highlight">families</span> have not applied for assistance because they have not needed hospital or medical treatment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hospital treatment would be the greatest cost incurred by low income <span class="highlight">families</span> as they would be accustomed to receiving medical treatment in the out-patient’s departments of public hospitals and most probably would continue to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One recommendation of the Nimmo Committee which was not accepted by the Government concerned additional assistance for large <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government decided finally that health insurance should not be used as the vehicle for assistance to large <span class="highlight">families</span> because other welfare measures such as taxation concessions and child endowment currently provide assistance of this nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This scheme is designed to help <span class="highlight">families</span> which are in a low income bracket. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can assist many people and many <span class="highlight">families</span> throughout Australia who need assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that there is a need to provide special finance for family units so that <span class="highlight">families</span> can extend their homes by the building of self-contained in-law units. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to turn now to the very human problems involved - the depopulation of many areas, the pressures on <span class="highlight">families</span>, the dislocation, the frustrations and the uncertainties that will emerge if we continue to denude the rural areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a fact that 100 <span class="highlight">families</span> have left the Huon Valley in the past 18 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We mean by that that we hope to have them embarked and home with their <span class="highlight">families</span> by that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But honourable members opposite can be assured that we will do all in our power to have those who arrive in Australia before 25th December with their <span class="highlight">families</span> on that date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its range is so vast that it could be said with fairness to affect a majority of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A recent survey in Melbourne reported that the incidence of poverty among <span class="highlight">families</span> without fathers was ‘substantially higher than in almost any other group in the community’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a decline which could be prevented if the Government were prepared to grant just that little bit of extra help which would not only bring about an increase in production but also, much more importantly, would mean that many more men would be employed and many more <span class="highlight">families</span> would be retained in or attracted to the areas concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are approximately 600 canning fruit growers in New South Wales, about 2,000 people on the farms with their <span class="highlight">families</span> and about 10,000 people who depend upon them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The subsidised health benefits plan, which has been in existence since January 1970, provides assistance in meeting the cost of medical and hospital treatment to persons receiving unemployment, sickness and special social service benefits, migrants during their first 2 months in Australia and low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The inadequacy of pre-school education particularly penalises migrant children whose <span class="highlight">families</span> speak at home languages other than English and the 400,000 children whose <span class="highlight">families</span> earn incomes below the poverty line or just above it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Seventy per cent of the children from suburbs where migrant and low-income <span class="highlight">families</span> congregate score below average in the communication skills which are fostered by a pre-school education whereas in more privileged suburbs the incidence of below average scores is only 30 per cent, less than half as great. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The economic crisis is now to hit the student campus and the casualties will be from the lower income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Commonwealth was properly concerned about economic barriers to higher education, the plight of many students and <span class="highlight">families</span> and the crisis in universities finance, it would do precisely the opposite - it would subsidise universities that kept fees down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are ways that can be contrived, as a previous speaker from the Government side has said, to ensure that people from low income <span class="highlight">families</span> receive the opportunity to go on to higher education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, this objection to the spending of Commonwealth funds on rich private schools fails to recognise that there is a significant group of private schools - the Catholic parish schools - which are poor, inadequate and over crowded and in which the children in the main come from poor <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The resultant loss of spending power due to the removal of <span class="highlight">families</span> from Parkes will result in a progressive reduction in the work force in service industries and commerce enforcing a movement of more people to the already over-crowded cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-0-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They include people on sickness and unemployment benefits of $10 a week and whole <span class="highlight">families</span> whose income is $49 a week or less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>its costliness to patients and their <span class="highlight">families</span>, and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to the everlasting credit of a great number of specialists that when treating people in the middle to high income bracket, the specialists, knowing that these people have <span class="highlight">families</span> to rear and are paying off their homes, have been satisfied to take the contribution from the medical benefits funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say this because of the evidence of the gross failure of the Commonwealth Government’s subsidised medical scheme for low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although this has been disastrous in itself nevertheless it exposes to the public only the financial side of the health care of low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and groups in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures show that only 25 per cent of eligible migrant <span class="highlight">families</span> and individuals arriving in Australia last year fully protected themselves in the Government’s scheme by registering with a private benefits organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government over the figures of those who are specifically low income <span class="highlight">families</span> living under or slightly above the minimum wage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suffice to say that even if we accept the dubious Government device of legislating 60,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> out of the low income category so that today not 180,000 but 120,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> are eligible for assistance, the simple fact is that this low income section of the community has been prevented by the over complexity and under publicity of the scheme from joining it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As at 30th June this year, just 18 months after the scheme came into operation, only 6,102 <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia earning less than $46.50 a week were registered with private benefits organisations and thereby protected against the costs of ill health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that as at 30th June this year, 18 months after the scheme came into operation, 6,102 <span class="highlight">families</span> on incomes below $46.50 were registered with a private benefits organisation and properly covered by the Government’s scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the means test should take account of family sizes to cover 250,000 low income <span class="highlight">families</span> or 1 million people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is satisfied with claiming eligibility for only 120,000 <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet only by including the largest number of low income <span class="highlight">families</span> can the scheme succeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here is the Govern* ment’s paradox: If it does not include all these <span class="highlight">families</span>, the whole scheme will not be effective; but if it does, there will be so much red tape and bureaucracy involved in coping with a multiplicity of means tests that, as Scotton and Deeble have pointed out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one of the reasons why the Canadian royal commission on health recommended that for a health scheme to be effective and economically to exempt low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, it would have to be a single compulsory scheme, that is, a scheme along the lines proposed by the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, even supposing every low income family eligible for Government assistance was involved in the Government subsidised scheme, the fundamental questions would still remain: What sort of care do such <span class="highlight">families</span> require, and are these needs being met? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, only a fraction of <span class="highlight">families</span> led by male wage earners on the minimum wage is included in the scheme at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the 1966 survey of poverty, while 17 per cent of intact <span class="highlight">families</span> in Melbourne were not insured, the percentage of fatherless <span class="highlight">families</span> not insured was 25 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1966 there were about 15,000 such <span class="highlight">families</span> in Victoria; so a quarter of these, or 3,750, would be uninsured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet no more than 2,373 <span class="highlight">families</span> earning less than $46.50 or more were enrolled with the Government scheme in February this year, while 4 months later a total of only 658 <span class="highlight">families</span> and individuals were registered with a private benefits organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As it happens, about 60 per cent of all the <span class="highlight">families</span> registered under the category earning less than $4.50 were <span class="highlight">families</span> led by women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus the scheme has massively discriminated against and excluded tens of thousands of low income <span class="highlight">families</span> led by male wage earners and wives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a consequence of all these factors, a very large number of low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and pensioners attend not a general practitioner but the outpatient clinic of the base hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could talk at length about the health needs of the aged, the low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, migrants and the Aborigines, yet of all these groups it is difficult to speak effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will help to lift some of the financial burden from nursing home patients and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This still happens of course in some <span class="highlight">families</span>, and perhaps would happen in more <span class="highlight">families</span> if we could provide the right kind of assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should integrate these municipality based services with municipal social work services, so that a co-ordinated system can exist, with a central reference point to help <span class="highlight">families</span> make appropriate plans for their frail aged members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>incentives for <span class="highlight">families</span> to care for their aged relatives in their homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many people it has meant using up their savings or having their nursing home fees paid out of the wages of sons and daughters who have their own <span class="highlight">families</span> to support as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, in addition, the pensioners’ <span class="highlight">families</span> are going to have to find still more funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last week 1 raised the matter of service men who will be returning home from Vietnam being assured of being home with their <span class="highlight">families</span> at Christmas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The distress of the servicemen and of their <span class="highlight">families</span> must be no less than the distress of people who would have been affected before the Minister’s assurance was given in the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us ensure their safety and the happiness of them and their <span class="highlight">families</span> by extending the Minister’s assurance to those servicemen who are left in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suggestion was that the Government was being very pinch- penny in its attitude in not providing means of transport in order to honour the promise that these servicemen would be able to be with their <span class="highlight">families</span> at Christmas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means only one thing, that men coming out of Vietnam with that withdrawal will not be travelling by train on Christmas Day; they will be with their <span class="highlight">families</span>, if this can possibly be arranged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These men will be flown out to Australia from Vietnam by the means which I have just described, and the Army has undertaken that all these men who are coming out by these means will be able to be with their <span class="highlight">families</span> by Christmas - unforeseen circumstances excepting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is every indication that the promise will be kept and that the men coming out in this main force withdrawal will be with their <span class="highlight">families</span> by Christmas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The table below gives a distribution of head of <span class="highlight">families</span> in private dwellings at the 1966 Census by numbers of dependent children (defined as children under 21 years of age nol in the labour force) without distinguishing between married and unmarried heads. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The resultant loss of spending power due to the removal of <span class="highlight">families</span> from Parkes will result in a progressive reduction in work force in service industries, commerce enforcing a movement of more people to the already overcrowded cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-0-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Dalgety’s were in desperate need of this cash subsidy, as is the case with large numbers of desperate wool growers and their <span class="highlight">families</span>, then this company would He entitled to financial assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The total cash payment to be made by this Government only to those interests to which I have referred is equivalent to the total income tax paid by 2,000 married men and their <span class="highlight">families</span> earning the average Australian wage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already there is a constant everincreasing stream of country people who, out of sheer desperation, being unable any longer to make a living for themselves and their <span class="highlight">families</span> on the land and in country towns, move into the great capital cities of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For 7 years the operations of this scheme have shown that the scheme discriminates massively against the children of low income <span class="highlight">families</span> whether they be in the inner suburban areas or in country areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a lot of money which could be used profitably on children of <span class="highlight">families</span> of low incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have since received many inquiries and representations from honourable members,town councils and others concerning the economic and social effects of the withdrawal of staff and their <span class="highlight">families</span> from country towns, some of which are already quite seriously affected by circumstances within the primary industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, has the Commonwealth considered the implication of this instruction with reference to students from low and middle income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-34-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I would point out that the Commonwealth is aware of the need to provide assistance for students from low and middle income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-34-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that Western Australian soldiers returning from Vietnam have to pay the difference between the rail and air fare from Sydney to Perth if they want to fly directly home to their <span class="highlight">families</span>, the amount being about $60? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that that would be an extremely high percentage of the work force because a large number of that 44 million were children because as is well known these <span class="highlight">families</span> have large numbers of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have in mind particularly the com.nunity at Blair Athol where we see a handful of miners who have been whittled down slowly but surely to just a small group of <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That town housing must be provided for all Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span> where the bread winner has permanent employment or an age or invalid pension entitlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-0-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this scheme local <span class="highlight">families</span> generously extend their hospitality and friendship to individual junior recruits from other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much good can come from an early contact with suitable <span class="highlight">families</span> in the Perth area and the meeting of junior recruit and sponsor should take place as soon as practicable after entry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Low income group <span class="highlight">families</span> and pensioners are deprived of access to public housing and condemned to sub-standard accommodation while spending years on the waiting list for what housing there is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the absence of public housing these people and their <span class="highlight">families</span> must find high rentals or accept sub-standard conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that the other tenants, themselves lowincome earners, are subsidising with their rents those necessitous <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of its long experience in providing housing for Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>, the Division would be an ideal body to undertake these new concepts of housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the increased interest rates for housing loans, a proportion of <span class="highlight">families</span> who previously could have obtained private assistance turned to the Commission when finance at levels they could afford was no longer available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the owners would drop rentals a lot if they could have access to  a  depreciation scale and they might be encouraged not to put up with substandard dwellings plastered here and there, housing <span class="highlight">families</span>, and creating all the associated problems of delinquency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rental assistance grant of $ 1.25m  a  year, for each of the next 5 years, is a general Commonwealth contribution towards the cost to State housing authorities of reduced rents being charged to the more needy <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a measure of the extent to which advances under the War Services Homes Act represent a very generous, fair and just contribution for homes for ex-servicemen and their <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Community resources are affected by the demand created by importation of <span class="highlight">families</span> and considerable strains are imposed by inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, to allow sponsorship of migrants to rest with Australian residents who sponsor <span class="highlight">families</span> and friends - from whatever country - and with well-known pyramid effects, will be disastrous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first of them is this: The Government has been tardy in the extreme in the matter of reuniting <span class="highlight">families</span>, ft took it 20 years to agree to provide assisted passages to enable a man to bring his wife and children to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people had to pay 20 per cent interest on borrowed money in order to get their <span class="highlight">families</span> here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are still delays of up to a year in reuniting <span class="highlight">families</span>, there are also delays of nearly a year in issuing visas for people to come and visit their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier this week the Government announced a deferment of the arrival of 3,000 migrant workers and their <span class="highlight">families</span> in order to assist some of those who are currently registered for employment to obtain jobs which the Government believes may otherwise be taken by migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously the easiest and most economical way to do this is to encourage larger Australian-born <span class="highlight">families</span>, as was pointed out a few minutes ago by my colleague the honourable member for Hume  (Mr Pettitt). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Employment being almost beyond him, the <span class="highlight">families</span> that have nominated him are forced to share his poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While stating that its immigration policy shall be administered with the avoidance of discrimination on any ground of race, or colour or nationality, the same Labor Party Conference adopted a policy to advise Australian mothers to limit their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, at this time, Australians have been asked by the Labor Party to curtail their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have made the suggestion before as a sort of rough improvement in equity that if the concessions for dependants - that is, wives and children - were doubled for everybody - I accept the fact that they would be doubled for the wealthy as well as for the poor - and if all other deductions were eliminated the saving to revenue would be about $200m as a consequence and the majority of taxpayers were dependants, particularly those <span class="highlight">families</span> where there there is only one breadwinner, would be advantaged if that were the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be effective in assisting <span class="highlight">families</span> this concession should be given in the form of a fixed rebate of total taxation for all family people and not be specifically designed to give a concession which increases with the wealth of the individual recipient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a country that has so many natural resources surely <span class="highlight">families</span> can expect something better than this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is competition in that prosperous industry in which a newer model must be secured by the <span class="highlight">families</span> in the suburbs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are, however, a large number of unemployable people and pensioners who, with their <span class="highlight">families</span>, live on pastoral properties at standards which are not satisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy that is now being followed by the Government is the very policy that was responsible for the resessions of 1956 and 1961 and, remember this, the depression of the 1930s which brought misery and suffering to the unemployed who could see their <span class="highlight">families</span> living below the breadline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remainder of the advances were used by State housing authorities to provide housing, primarily for persons of low or moderate means, with the proviso that they could be required to set aside in each year up to 5 per cent of the housing advances made by the Commonwealth for the construction of dwellings for servicemen’s <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Advances under the Housing Agreements with the States have been used to provide reasonably priced rental accommodation for low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and to assist these <span class="highlight">families</span> to own their own homes by the offer of low deposit long term loans at a concessional rate of interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This grant of financial assistance is to be used by the housing authority of the State for the purpose of reducing the rents of dwellings for <span class="highlight">families</span> they consider to have insufficient means to pay the rents ordinarily payable to the authority in respect of those dwellings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me say in rebuttal of what has been said by the honourable member for Angas that there is not a redundancy problem insofar as the sulphuric acid plant is concerned which is affecting the social welfare of some members of <span class="highlight">families</span> both at Nairne in the honourable member’s electorate or in the Largs North area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will probably mean also that a significant number of people and their <span class="highlight">families</span> will be out of work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been estimated that up to 1,000 servicemen could remain in Vietnam, lt is up to the Minister for the Army  (Mr Peacock)  to spell out what is to happen to these men so that they and their <span class="highlight">families</span> can plan for the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole of the work force of the mine and the workers’ <span class="highlight">families</span> would be obliged to move, as also would most businessmen and their employees, and the only place to which they would be likely to move would be the capital city provided, of course, that they could obtain housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present population in Norseman is approximately  1,600  and it is estimated that a closure of the mine would mean a reduction in that population by at least  50  per ‘cent almost immediately and then, as housing became available elsewhere for the <span class="highlight">families</span> of workers, the population would reduce still further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As previous speakers have mentioned, it was thought that the mining development around this goldmining area would in fact make employment available for those <span class="highlight">families</span> which were being phased out of the goldmining industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the major aims of our housing contribution in the next 3 years will be to encourage the States to provide decent housing for lower income <span class="highlight">families</span> who are unable to obtain satisfactory private accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One major group amongst the undeserving poor is <span class="highlight">families</span> who, because of their social instability or their tendency to fall into rental arrears, are excluded from public housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the ‘problem’ <span class="highlight">families</span> who frequent public and voluntary welfare agencies with a variety of social disabilities, such as alcoholism, children at risk, employment instability, marital problems and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A reasonable argument can be advanced in favour of the policy by which State housing authorities exclude problem <span class="highlight">families</span> from public housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be argued with respect to the social problems of these <span class="highlight">families</span> that housing authorities are not social welfare agencies and are not organised to solve the social disabilities of problem <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unfair that other public housing tenants should be required to put up with the nuisance created by problem <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, this position does not cut across the fact that problem <span class="highlight">families</span> have, or can have, an acute housing problem in addition to their other problems - the Bill does not solve that problem - and that under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement these <span class="highlight">families</span> are effectively excluded from receiving public assistance with their housing problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is to say, all that the present situation tells us is that public housing authorities are an unsuitable vehicle for assisting problem <span class="highlight">families</span> with their housing needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The further question of whether or not these <span class="highlight">families</span> should be dented public assistance with housing is left untouched. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this viewpoint is adopted, and if it is also accepted that public housing authorities are not the appropriate vehicle for helping problem <span class="highlight">families</span> with their housing needs, it is necessary to evolve new forms of assistance for these <span class="highlight">families</span> with their housing problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What appears necessary is extensive research into the housing difficulties of problem <span class="highlight">families</span> and into possible mechanisms whereby public assistance can be provided in order to overcome difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These people have an acute housing need but, as with problem <span class="highlight">families</span>, their housing need is inseparable from their complex of other social problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These migrants find strong social needs to live amongst their extended <span class="highlight">families</span>, friend* ft om their former village, ethnic shopping facilities, theatres and clubs, and to accept public housing would involve the breaking of these many social bonds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In particular it will be directed towards meeting the shortage of cheap rental accommodation for <span class="highlight">families</span> of inadequate means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This type of accommodation is not conducive to having young <span class="highlight">families</span> at a time when they ought to have them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The South Australian Housing Trust has carried out some very interesting and valuable investigations of incomes of <span class="highlight">families</span> obtaining rental housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have here the result of the most recent study covering the 5 week period to 1st October 1971, in which 412 <span class="highlight">families</span> were allotted rental homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The study dealt with family incomes and incomes of male heads of <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>More than 46 per cent of the <span class="highlight">families</span> earned $60 or less a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For male heads of <span class="highlight">families</span> the commonest income was $42.50, and 62 per cent of male heads of <span class="highlight">families</span> were earning between $41 and $60 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Trust stated:  lt is obvious that the vast majority of <span class="highlight">families</span> applying to the Trust for assistance cannot afford to buy their own houses, or even pay the relatively high rents that prevail today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This will help the States to reduce rental costs to those <span class="highlight">families</span> they regard as being in need of assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I get complaints - I suppose other members do, too - from <span class="highlight">families</span> who have had their names down tor a State housing commission house and have had to accept a (flat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we have had some very frank discussions with the Commonwealth I must in all fairness to the Commonwealth say that 1 do not doubt for one minute the sincerity of its desire to assist the States in housing low and moderate income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why the Government has neither encouraged nor demanded of the States experimentation in the design of low cost housing to allow for the changing needs of <span class="highlight">families</span> amazes me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may have escaped the notice of the Government that less than half a century ago a 2-bedroom villa, with perhaps an enclosed front verandah, satisfied the needs of most <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The demand is for much greater variation to meet the demands of the various members of the family, even though <span class="highlight">families</span> have decreased in size. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These needs apply to the <span class="highlight">families</span> of low income earners also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill offers no evidence that the government is aware that <span class="highlight">families</span> are not standardised, lt appears to be totally unaware that low income housing, more than any other, should provide for flexibility of use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only myopic vision and lack of openness to the future - not constitutional impediment - prevents this Government from insisting on the States doing the following: Firstly, extending the Holmesglen prefabricated concrete factory’s activities to include competition with speculative bi,i.d:rs; secondly, ensuring that provision is made for expert advice and the granting of loans for the renovation of houses in the inner suburbs; and, thirdly, taking positive steps to ensure that low income houses, which inevitably are small, have sufficient inbuilt flexibility of design to  m?2i  the changing needs of <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Referring again to Dame Annabelle’s address to the building and construction forum in September of last year, I would draw honourable members’ attention to her intention to ask the States to use more of the Commonwealth advances for housing needy <span class="highlight">families</span> on the lowest income scales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only the Commonwealth Government has the powers to ensure that <span class="highlight">families</span> are raised in an environment that does not place strains on the other needs of the <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Advances under the housing agreements with the States have been used to provide reasonablypriced rental accommodation for low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and to assist these <span class="highlight">families</span> to own their own homes by the offer of low-deposit long term loans at a concessional rate of interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Parents of <span class="highlight">families</span> which have grown up and left their homes to live elsewhere or to get married, often find themselves in a home which is larger than they need and which requires a considerable amount of upkeep. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The philosophy of a house and garden for all <span class="highlight">families</span> which can afford a deposit and regular repayments is as central to housing policy and administration  today  as it was in 1918. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a consequence of this many people who are wage earners - the 2- income <span class="highlight">families</span>, the young people who go out to work - find themselves buying homes the value of which excludes them from eligibility under the home savings grant scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was just doing a little mental calculation which indicates that in the total period of the scheme’s operation - I think it is one of the most magnificent any country has ever adopted - a total of 324,217 ex-servicemen have been provided with homes, and with their <span class="highlight">families</span>, which is the way we normally calculate things in Australia, this means that about 1 million people have been provided with homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This, of course, changed the whole social attitude to university education and <span class="highlight">families</span> such as mine could see that not only people such as the odd one who managed to make the distance for some reason or other - the person who became a teacher and then for professional reasons managed to get into university - received a university education but that a university education became a natural social objective for the whole family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As from 1st November 1971 it is proposed to introduce a simplified application form for use by low income <span class="highlight">families</span> when applying for assistance, and provision will be made on the form to enable a responsible person, such as a hospital secretary, to assist a person incapable of completing the official application form and in taking the necessary steps required in applying for the assistance available under the Plan and enrolling in a health insurance fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-45-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that the people who live in the outback represent much of the best of Australia and at the moment they are in a very difficult position in relation to the education of their <span class="highlight">families</span>, and I am very much aware of that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People sell according to their station of life and, of course, some of them come from poor <span class="highlight">families</span> and become some of the greatest citizens of this country and do so much for the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Others from prosperous and rich <span class="highlight">families</span> do nothing at all for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can well understand members of the Opposition saying that this question of parental concern is a matter of no moment or of no concern to them because they would believe that government policy and government actions should replace the obligations and responsibilities that in many areas should properly lie with the <span class="highlight">families</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a typical attitude that the Opposition has adopted in a number of areas, believing that government activity can undertake matters which the <span class="highlight">families</span> properly should do for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, as a result of what I have said, there are some <span class="highlight">families</span> who become more concerned to support their children than otherwise might have done, I will be content. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Where a deliberate action of a government by varying a tariff creates hardship in the form of unemployment of people or resources owned by those people, there has to be a constructive and not destructive policy to compensate those people who, through no fault of their own but because of Government policy, find themselves out of a job or discover that they have to move their <span class="highlight">families</span>, sell their houses and assets and settle in some other place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Authority has no general information on <span class="highlight">families</span> receiving cash and other supplementary help, and therefore the percentage of children receiving free meals was taken as the most accessible measure of this criterion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>More recent and accurate Information on Social Class - Large <span class="highlight">Families</span> was available from the Special Literary Survey carried out by the ILEA in 1968 and this was used for these two measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The longstanding tie between private schools and Australia’s business and landowning <span class="highlight">families</span> scarcely needs “proving”: their continued and current exclusiveness, too, might safely be taken for granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Obviously if there is a crash in wool prices and there are great pastoral <span class="highlight">families</span> who have been prosperous and have developed the habit over generations of sending their children to a school like Geelong Grammar, such <span class="highlight">families</span> will either pay for their sons out of capital or will have to withdraw the children from the school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The former Prime Minister promised to pay special attention to the needs of low income <span class="highlight">families</span> with young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not keen to shove them into units which would move them away from their traditional home site, their home in which they raised their <span class="highlight">families</span> and with which they have had a long term association that is a sort of spiritual relationship with their environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We ought to be encouraging <span class="highlight">families</span> to hold together the extended family unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We, as Australian citizens, should be proud, as the Minister pointed out, that 80 per cent of married age pensioners in Australia today own their own homes and that 50 per cent of single age pensioners also own their own homes, Many of the others are satisfactorily housed in aged persons homes under this Act or are living comfortably with their <span class="highlight">families</span> as they choose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Minister’s view much too large a proportion of <span class="highlight">families</span> with children at state schools didn’t give their children the encouragement in their home environment to encourage them to stay at school as long as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This sort of argument would have much greater force if the Government did anything at all to assist poorer <span class="highlight">families</span> to keep children at school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These principles are: Firstly, a greatly increased expenditure on education; secondly, expenditure on education to be allocated on a basis of need so that education will overcome the disadvantages of those children from <span class="highlight">families</span> with limited incomes - in other words, to provide equality of opportunity; and thirdly, decentralisation of decision making and devolution of power so that maximum autonomy is given to teachers and students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the criteria by which that organisation works in relation to schools are the social class of the personss in the vicinity, the housing stress, the number of large <span class="highlight">families</span>, the question of poverty, the number of immigrants, the number of handicapped pupils, teacher stress, the hours that teachers have to teach, the subjects and the class sizes, pupil turnover, parental interest and the adequacy of school buildings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is all right for those children who are lucky enough to come from <span class="highlight">families</span> which have available to them a substantial body of literature and in which the parents have a substantial body of learning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When you come to the State schools, the Government schools, unfortunately there are still some <span class="highlight">families</span> who don’t give their children- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, as he said only some <span class="highlight">families</span> he corrected himself - perhaps much too large a proportion of <span class="highlight">families</span>- that is, whose children attend State schools - who don’t give their children the encouragement in the home environment which helps them, or encourages them to stay at school as long as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There appear to be reasonable grounds therefore for suggesting that a more effective use of the funds at present devoted to the scholarships might be either in adding to the number of tertiarylevel awards, or in using some form of means test to ensure that awards at the secondary school level go to <span class="highlight">families</span> likely to be in real need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am a little surprised that the Leader of the Opposition should continue to ask questions concerning a child endowment scheme in view of his proposals for matters, such as child endowment, which are intimately concerned with the Australian population and Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would ask him to look a little more closely at his own proposals and attitudes towards the Australian population, the people involved in its development and his proposals for immigration, Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>, the numbers of children born in Australia and the rights of Australian children, old, young and even unborn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>(i) Low Income <span class="highlight">Families</span> - When the subsidy arrangements were introduced on 1 January 1970 there was one category of low income family, namely <span class="highlight">families</span> with incomes of $39 per week or less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-37-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Originally the Government estimated that throughout Australia 180,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> would be eligible for free health insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage there are probably no more than 7,000 <span class="highlight">families</span>, or 4 per cent, enrolled in the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Victoria only 750 <span class="highlight">families</span> are fully covered with free health insurance, yet on the Government figures there should be 60,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, in Victoria only about 1 per cent of all the eligible <span class="highlight">families</span> is actually covered by this health insurance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suppose that in my own electorate there should be at least 3,000 to 5,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> getting subsidised health insurance but the figures reveal that the position is nothing like that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The maximum number of <span class="highlight">families</span> covered for free health insurance because of low income below $51.50 at the moment is 2. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is now inflicting another publicity scheme on poor and low income <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Government take steps to provide funds to ensure that a suitable service of this kind is provided for Service personnel and their <span class="highlight">families</span> at all Army camps. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-42-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Approximately 1,060 adults and 1,570 children live in Army married quarters in Puckapunyal while approximately 540 adult and 530 child members of Army <span class="highlight">families</span> live in married quarters in the environs of the town of Seymour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-42-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>(5) and (6) This information is within the province of the Seymour Shire Authorities and relates to their private dealings with individual <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-42-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The subsidised Home Help Service operated by the Shire of Seymour is available to Army <span class="highlight">families</span> living in the Seymour area, but not to those living in Puckapunyal pending the outcome of the negotiations in (1). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-42-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Representations to the Victorian authorities resulted in 1970 in extensions of the Home Help Scheme to Army <span class="highlight">families</span> living in married quarters in the Seymour area outside of Puckapunyal, since when the situation described in answer to part  7  has continued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-42-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The new scheme will thus provide an incentive to able students and at the same time make available special assistance to those students whose <span class="highlight">families</span> may find difficulty in maintaining them at school for a full secondary education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that this new scholarships scheme for secondary students will significantly assist able children from low income <span class="highlight">families</span> to remain longer at school than they otherwise would. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There appears to be reasonable grounds therefore for suggesting that a more effective use of the funds at present devoted to scholarships might be either in adding to the number of tertiary level awards, or in using some form of means test to ensure that awards at the secondary school level go to <span class="highlight">families</span> likely to be in real need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The form of assistance to the States still lacks any Commonwealth approach to create a fund to bring poor schools up to acceptable standards and to assist poor <span class="highlight">families</span> whose children attend government and non-government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should be the right of this substantial number of children from underprivileged <span class="highlight">families</span> to break some even ground, to overcome the inequalities that exist in this country at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think I mentioned this morning also - if I did not, it remains a fact - that the revised programme of assistance for scholarships will do a very great deal to help an additional number of <span class="highlight">families</span> to have their children pursue their education further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A recent survey of applications for child care conducted by the Sydney Day Nursery Schools Association showed that 40 per cent of all applications were from oneparent <span class="highlight">families</span> - usually a divorced mother, a widowed mother or a deserted wife - in which the mother had to work to support herself and the children, and that 47 per cent of 2-parent applications were from <span class="highlight">families</span> in economic difficulties because of high rents, hire purchase debts or debts arising from illness or accident necessitating hospital and/or medical care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point made in this statement is that while it is very desirable for our normal Australian children to have pre-school education it is all the more desirable so for children of <span class="highlight">families</span> where English is not normally spoken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this Budget $5m is appropriated to provide accommodation and training for specialised staff to deal with the children of low income and special need <span class="highlight">families</span> as well as the children of working parents who must leave their child ren, sometimes in the care of friends or relations or sometimes without care at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said earlier, the method which the Government has decided to use on this occasion in relation to alterations in the taxation scale has further aggravated and further reduced the living standard of the family man and the man on the lower income as measured against those without <span class="highlight">families</span> or in comfortable or wealthy circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second problem encountered by these <span class="highlight">families</span> is the repayment rates, and it is possible to extend these repayment rates over a longer period in order to meet the paying capacity of the <span class="highlight">families</span> concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the magnitude of money that is going to rural industries in Australia; yet we still have the pathetic and tragic stories of young <span class="highlight">families</span> coming to the cities because they cannot be accommodated on rural properties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the report of the Commonwealth’s Director-General of Social Services says that the number of children per family endowed is 2.18. and in only one out of 12 <span class="highlight">families</span> is money coming from the Commonwealth for the third child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole concept has been to stuff old people into nursing homes and not to provide the services which would allow them to stay in their own homes, to stay with their <span class="highlight">families</span>, to stay in the suburbs where they have been born and bred, where they have reared their children and where they have a spiritual relationship, which is a very important thing and which has been wrecked and shattered to the great disadvantage not only of those people but also of society, because there are social costs involved in this sort of thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If genuine concern had been felt, immediate taxation relief by way of tax deduction for money expended on child minding in day care and family care centres would have been provided; These mothers’ efforts to maintain themselves and their <span class="highlight">families</span> should be rewarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the unemployment problems in Western Australia, will the Minister investigate the possibility of immediately curtailing further Commonwealth immigration to Western Australia except of those persons who have guaranteed employment and housing or to reunite <span class="highlight">families</span> and will not displace or add to the employment difficulties of people who are already citizens of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The size of the tax deductibility which has been set to favour the family man and to assist oneincome <span class="highlight">families</span> is not only popular; it is proper, just and immediate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second point which again was mentioned by one daily newspaper only in Australia was the Government’s decision to impose strict controls on fees charged by nursing homes for the aged as part of the Government’s new plan to assist patients and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can just imagine the tumult from all those children from working class and migrant <span class="highlight">families</span> when Melbourne Grammar drops its fees from $1,050 a year to $1,025 a year or when Geelong Grammar drops its fees from $1,000 a year to $950 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to the Government that if there is one area in which this Budget has failed - and failed in a most grievous way - it is in neglecting the children, and also the mothers of <span class="highlight">families</span> who carry the great burden of high costs at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am afraid I cannot agree with my honourable friend from Macquarie  (Mr Luchetti)  when he says that this Government has neglected the <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The sorts of things that are so obvious as symptoms of a general breakdown in our society reach well beyond <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As things currently stand, most people, and particularly those with <span class="highlight">families</span> on lower income levels, would be advantaged if family concessions were liberalised and all other deductions eliminated, and the revenue yield would go up as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The hide of him to stand in this House this afternoon and talk about the workers of Australia and his concern for their security, and to talk about the young <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia when all this Government is prepared to do for young <span class="highlight">families</span> in regard to such an item as child minding centres is to offer them as much as it is prepared to offer the farmers to pull out trees which a few years ago it encouraged them to plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prime Minister to claim that the Government is genuinely interested in young <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly:the Association calls for more Government finance for public housing programmes, especially for cooperative building societies, and secondly, it calls for a reduction in or subsidy on interest rates as a practical means to assist lower income <span class="highlight">families</span> to- obtain- their own home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is genuine in its desire to help young <span class="highlight">families</span> where in this Budget is provision made for this? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is time to consider such things as 100 per cent loans for low income .<span class="highlight">families</span> unable to save the required deposit, ‘which would be some where between 10 per- cent and 20 per cent of the cost of a home? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To most members of the Labor Party and to most members of the community the only real surprise in the Budget is the fact that <span class="highlight">families</span> have been virtually neglected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Families</span> have been neglected and <span class="highlight">families</span> are the life blood of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be too late, although I predict that something will be proposed by the Government in its policy speech, for some <span class="highlight">families</span> in the community if they have to wait much longer for assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Many <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia today live close to the poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is literally true that more taxpayers would pay less tax if the concessions for <span class="highlight">families</span> were doubled and every other deduction was eliminated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know of anyone who can accurately determine the statistical evidence in this respect but I am confident that most of those with high savings bank deposits are young people who are perhaps not yet married and are saving up to buy a home, 2 income <span class="highlight">families</span> and persons in the middle age group whose family is off their hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some are older with <span class="highlight">families</span> off their hands, such as the honourable member who interjects and myself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have all the responsibility of bringing up their <span class="highlight">families</span> and they must do this on the one income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, I suppose, we all remember the Treasurer having his fingers burned earlier this year when he flew a kite about taxing <span class="highlight">families</span> rather than individual units within a family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could make a payment to large <span class="highlight">families</span> where mothers have young children and are unable to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We might be able to provide selective benefits to the low income <span class="highlight">families</span> so that their children could be sent to proper child minding centres, not just somewhere where the children are plonked in front of a television set all day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We might be able to give money to the poorer sections in the outer metropolitan areas which, as honourable members know, have rate problems, or we might be able to give money to low income <span class="highlight">families</span> or to pensioners to help them to pay their rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The House extends its deepest sympathies to the <span class="highlight">families</span> and relatives of the deceased, and calls upon all countries which participated in the Games to preserve this unique institution from attacks on its competitors and its ideals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to the incidence of taxation on the lower income group, especially those with young <span class="highlight">families</span> and more especially those <span class="highlight">families</span> in which there is only one income earner, the average reduction overall is 10 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposals announced in the Budget Speech to provide for the allowance of deductions for self-education expenses, the increase in the minimum taxable income and in dependants allowances, and the reduction in the rates of personal income tax, which will average 10 per cent per annum, will provide substantial reductions in the total income tax payable by all persons, but especially those with <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The zone allowances were introduced by a Labor government in 1945 and were opposed very bitterly at that time by the Liberal-Country Party Opposition although they were granted in recognition of and as compensation for the disadvantages which taxpayers and their <span class="highlight">families</span> suffer by living in zone areas, disadvantages such as the high cost of living, the uncongenial climatic conditions and the isolation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it seems to me that if the court’s decision to grant $300 was correct, then the Government by taxing the allowance is deliberately lowering the living standard of those taxpayers and their <span class="highlight">families</span> in district allowance areas by $2 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was not possible to amend the eligibility level for low income <span class="highlight">families</span> until the following parliamentary session as the change involved an amendment to the National Health Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-39-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The eligibility limits for low income <span class="highlight">families</span> under the Subsidised Health Benefits Plan have been altered on 3 occasions, 1st July 1970, 1st March 1971 and 5th June 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-39-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As from 1st July 1970, the Government decided to provide also graduated assistance toward the costs of contributing for health insurance to 2 additional groups of low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-39-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures for eligible low income <span class="highlight">families</span> supplied by the Department of Social Services are those as at 3rd January 1972 and for unemployment, sickness or special beneficiaries as at 25th December 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-39-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to migrants, it is necessary to take into consideration that the total figures for migrant settlers do not represent the number of persons entitled to be enrolled in the Subsidised Health Benefits Plan because, in the case of <span class="highlight">families</span>, enrolment by the head of the family provides Subsidised Health Benefits entitlements for the whole of the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-39-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The College will play an increasingly important part in educating Aborigines who, in turn, will be able to influence their <span class="highlight">families</span> and other Aboriginals in the community to recognise the advantage of a better educational standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A fully effective programme should both keep up with the growth rate in family formation, which is roughly estimated to be of the order of 1,200 new <span class="highlight">families</span> a year, and overcome at the same time the very substantial backlog. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I estimate that for the first time the allocation for 1972-73, taken along with what the States are doing with funds from their own resources, should provide enough houses to keep pace with the rate of family formation amongst those <span class="highlight">families</span> wishing to occupy houses provided by governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The housing programmes aim primarily to assist <span class="highlight">families</span>, whose children will benefit thereby; a great deal of health activity is devoted to improving the health situation of Aboriginal infants and children; the bulk of expenditure in education is, of course, for younger Aborigines; while the employment training scheme and other activities of the Department of Labour and National Service seek in particular to assist schoolleavers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that money were used in the state sector alone or the Catholic sector, it could bulldoze and demolish some of the decaying and antiquated inner suburban and country schools where children from working class and migrant <span class="highlight">families</span> are suffering under the most squalid physical conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a strong argument for that, because one can argue on the need for decentralisation, that is, the desirability of permanently settling in country areas as many <span class="highlight">families</span> as possible, that is, settlers who will raise their children in those areas as distinct from, say, itinerant workers and who would form the nucleus of small country towns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>About 600 members of the Closer Settlement Association and their <span class="highlight">families</span> have been settled on the land by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those 600 <span class="highlight">families</span> have said: ‘Well, we will stay by the words of those members as members and not as Ministers.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a very nice technical statement, but it does mean that there are <span class="highlight">families</span> and settlers in those locations who are in trouble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a settler walks off his block, other settlers in the area or their immediate <span class="highlight">families</span> are given first choice of purchase by paying 15 per cent deposit and taking over the existing mortgage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If post-1945 exservicemen were able with priority to establish eligibility to take over existing mortgages, current settlers, most of whom are in their 50s and many of whom do not have <span class="highlight">families</span> interested in taking over the blocks, could sell to the younger men who are perhaps fitter and more able to keep this part of the fruit industry alive and progressive in the increasingly competitive atmosphere of today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is through the home environment, through better housing and the obtaining of housing soon after marriage that we can assist <span class="highlight">families</span> in this country to stay together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Home ownership is no longer a luxury; it is a necessity for many of our people and it is the right of all <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite clear that some of the bits and pieces of the cities that do not deserve any attention and do not deserve any precise administration or precise calculation are those bits and pieces inhabited by millions of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> and which in fact involve their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Government supporters cannot show me one direction in which the Government has done anything for the children of <span class="highlight">families</span>, apart from the 75 cents which is granted in respect of the children of war widows, the benefits relating to orphans and a couple of little things like that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a very important aspect because on many occasions <span class="highlight">families</span> engaged in primary production have managed, over a great number of years, to make their farms viable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This should be examined more carefully to ascertain whether greater benefits can be given particularly to those <span class="highlight">families</span> in the categories to which I have referred, that is, immediate relatives and those who qualify under the classification of spouse, children or grandchildren of the deceased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has caused great personal hardship particularly throughout the countryside, led to the destruction of family farms and even to the break-up of <span class="highlight">families</span> themselves in tragic circumstances, trying to meet an impossible tax conceived 2 generations ago and allowed to grow into a mindless, inflexible Frankenstein monster which has devoured and destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As we look around at the deprived areas in Australia and the deprived schools about which We of the Labor Party talk we see that they are, typically, in the working class area - the areas with larger <span class="highlight">families</span>, the areas where both parents go to work, the areas where there is a greater concentration of migrants, areas where there are more <span class="highlight">families</span> dependent on welfare payments and areas where more children have to leave school at an earlier age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately, when one speaks of parents and children in outback areas, there seems to be a tendency in some quarters to believe that one is talking about rich pastoralists or cattle kings and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The major extension of Commonwealth scholarships at both secondary and tertiary levels will help many <span class="highlight">families</span> and bring the opportunity for wider and higher education within the reach of many more thousands of students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking at the new Commonwealth secondary scholarships scheme, the fact that for the first time since 1965 a means test has now been introduced into this scheme is in itself a condemnation of a consistent policy of discrimination in favour of the children from more affluent <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can guarantee right now that not more than 30 per cent of the pupils who will get scholarships in the future will be getting the full allowance of $250, and that is a very generous estimate because the simple fact is that the children who come from low income <span class="highlight">families</span> do not win these scholarships in the first place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What it will mean is that more scholarships will go to children from <span class="highlight">families</span> with average weekly earnings to the higher income <span class="highlight">families</span> but the children who are in maximum need in the community will not get assistance at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the most notable developments one finds if one travels through the country is that following the vicissitudes the farming industry has experienced over recent years many sons of the farming <span class="highlight">families</span>, and daughters too, do not want to continue with the vocation of farming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The great change here is that the greater part of the assistance will go tolow income <span class="highlight">families</span> and the, smaller part will be a reward for academic ability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is a significant advance and one which will assist a large number of low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, and all the talk from members of the Opposition cannot hide that fact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The quality of child care is important not only to parents who, for one reason or another, choose to work, but also to all parents because in today’s mobile society, with <span class="highlight">families</span> living apart from grandparents and other relatives, there are many who have nowhere to turn when they are ill or in need of assistance with their children during the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>and (2) The number of people who can be accommodated in a migrant hostel fluctuates almost daily according to arrivals and departures, the size and composition of <span class="highlight">families</span> including the age and sex of children, whether or not rooms are to be shared by members of <span class="highlight">families</span>, and the number of rooms undergoing maintenance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-38-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>National service not only disrupts the <span class="highlight">families</span> of cockies but also the <span class="highlight">families</span> of apprentices who are undertaking their early training and hoping to be helpful to Australia when they finish their time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A more direct and immediate effect could have been obtained on the economy generally by stimulating the housing sector- by measures to reduce land prices through greater allocations for provision of essential services; by taxation and/ or direct subsidies to reduce effective interest rates on housing loans: by special allocations to assist lowerincome <span class="highlight">families</span> to obtain homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I recall the honourable member for Reid  (Mr Uren)  and the honourable member for Hughes  (Mr Les Johnson)  stating that the waiting lists for all the State housing commissions total something of the order of 90,000 to 96,000 <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of the $l,509m advanced to the States over the 15 years to 30th June 1971, $ 1,024m was allocated to the State housing authorities which up to 30th June 1971 built some 145,000 dwellings with these moneys for rental or sale to <span class="highlight">families</span> and other persons of low or moderate means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a general Commonwealth contribution towards the cost to State housing authorities of charging reduced rents to <span class="highlight">families</span> that they regard as needing assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition, the Minister for Health  (Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)  is introducing 3 new measures: Firstly, to give additional assistance to chronically ill aged patients in nursing homes; secondly, to increase the Commonwealth subsidy paid to organisations providing home nursing services; and, thirdly, a new domiciliary care benefit to encourage <span class="highlight">families</span> and relatives to accept responsibility in their homes for the provision of professional nursing care and supporting services required by an aged infirm person, in order to reduce the demand for nursing home treatment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe one of the things we have to accept is that the Department must readily co-operate with other authorities - State, semi-government and local government - in providing those services which individuals and <span class="highlight">families</span> require. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is that if a child of one of these unfortunate <span class="highlight">families</span> in these circumstances turns 16, and if the child has ability and his family and the community generally want that child to stay at school and perhaps go forward to university, the allowance payable for that child ceases immedi ately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that only about 3 per cent of the student body in Australian universities come from <span class="highlight">families</span> with a gross income of from $50 to $60 a week, which one might say was the basic wage for a family today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that the changed basis of the secondary scholarship proposal which will have a means test attached to it to provide by far the greater part of the total assistance to students from low income <span class="highlight">families</span> will be a significant help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stress to honourable members that Australia makes double the provision of tertiary places that the United Kingdom makes, that scholarship schemes have been very greatly expanded, that now within universities a greater proportion of students than ever before is supported by Commonwealth scholarships, and that those scholarships for next year and from next year on are to be made available on much more favourable terms than ever before in all their history, again providing the greater part of the support for low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would think that the fact that under the old arrangement 40 per cent of the Commonwealth scholarship holders are gaining all or part of the living allowance indicates that they come from lower income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Barton has failed completely to recognise the changed basis of the Commonwealth secondary scholarships which out of the total value of the secondary scholarship over 2 years will provide $500 of the $800 available to students from low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I repeat that no amount of twisting of the figures can get to anything like that figure of very nearly $1,000 which the States and Commonwealth between them make available for students with scholarships from low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and who attend government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Government aware that many primary producers have not qualified for rural reconstruction finance only because of great personal sacrifice on their part and on the part of their <span class="highlight">families</span>,  and that they now need and deserve long term finance to enable them to take advantage of the present favourable prices for many rural products? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am in favour of the Bill on the grounds that <span class="highlight">families</span> who opt to use contraceptives, and particularly those on low incomes, ought not through economic pressures to find the exercise of their choice constrained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The contribution towards extending choice in family planning for low income <span class="highlight">families</span> is a proper social consideration and I believe that the removal of sales tax from contraceptives is justified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The technological revolution has freed most women from the heaviest of domestic work, and while most - not all - feel they ought still to be home with their <span class="highlight">families</span> while they are young, many have been well educated for a non-domestic vocation or, in fact, for a career occupation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The relative boredom of a daytime suburban home has thrown up the serious problem of suburban neurosis among young married women with young <span class="highlight">families</span> and of women whose <span class="highlight">families</span> no longer require the full time care which formerly, when they were younger, the mother gave to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to <span class="highlight">families</span> which, in many instances, are increasing the number of children within them - <span class="highlight">families</span> which are aware of the difficulties that they will encounter in giving to their children the care, education and opportunities for the future which they would wish to give. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are other <span class="highlight">families</span> growing in numbers who do not have a realisation of the proper opportunity and equality that should be made available to their children and, for the objective observer, these <span class="highlight">families</span> are creating a situation in which there is likely to be a perpetuation of the less advantaged people in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the things that has happened m the structural changes in the proprietary companies is that there has been a great deal of finance invested in companies which previously were to a considerable degree locked in because <span class="highlight">families</span> were involved over a successive number of generations and as a result of the death of one or another of the early members of the family it was not possible to apply large amounts of capital to develop or to change the basic operation of the former family based company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On the one hand the Government, through this Bill, has placed the Commonwealth Bank back in the competitive housing loan business, because the Government strongly supports home ownership and wants to help needy <span class="highlight">families</span>; and on the other hand it says that some cases it is not the right solution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All I want to say to him at this stage is that it seems to be the case that for 93,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> or more home ownership in fact has not been the solution to their problem because it has been inaccessible to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is one point to which the Minister did not draw attention - maybe he did not because it overlaps into areas of other ministerial responsibilities - and that is that this problem of migrant children, or of children generally from underprivileged <span class="highlight">families</span> and underprivileged homes, cannot be tackled or solved solely in the school itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill, as other honourable members who have spoken have mentioned, provides $6.5m as an emergency grant to the States for the provision of housing for low income or needy <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The money provided under this Bill is designed to provide more rental accommodation for low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and, as I have said, this is a principle with which there would be general agreement on all sides of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have personal knowledge of many instances in my own electorate where rentals being charged by certain landlords have resulted in the standard of living of many <span class="highlight">families</span> being drastically reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention this fact because it is clear that with low wages and no control over rents, many Queensland <span class="highlight">families</span> are placed in an extremely invidious position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The United States of America - I do not think anybody would suggest that the United States is a socialist country - has a program of assistance for rental and co-operative housing for lower income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the United States of America it is recognised that people on low incomes should be assisted in this way, and a scheme has been devised by which the lower rental <span class="highlight">families</span> are subsidised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1971, the Canadian Government-financed loan company, the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation, was seeking proposals from builders and developers for the construction, ownership and operation of rental housing for low income <span class="highlight">families</span> in 26 centres in Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The financing arrangements and the rentals agreed between the Corporation and the builders and developers would provide rental accommodation at below market prices for low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because this Government had carefully been assessing over the previous 3 years what its policy should be and because it had realised the great need for cheap houses for needy <span class="highlight">families</span>, one of its first actions on assuming office was to announce that emergency grants would be given to provide cheap housing for needy <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He was fortunate enough to live in a Housing Commission home, not in an affluent area but in an area surrounded by people who were bringing up young <span class="highlight">families</span> and who were prepared to give everything they could to the education of those <span class="highlight">families</span> and to give them an opportunity in life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are young people bringing up their <span class="highlight">families</span>, striving hard to do it, and I am sick and tired of those people who try to rubbish the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words we should ensure that cheap housing for needy <span class="highlight">families</span> is not simply housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a poor environment in which to bring up <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister’s clumsy efforts to cover up for the Yugoslav Prime Minister are an insult to the Australian people, to the Australian Parliament and especially to the <span class="highlight">families</span> of the men who were put to death. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The provisions in this Bill will not only enable the scheme to continue making an important contribution to the national welfare by assisting eligible persons and their <span class="highlight">families</span> in all parts of the Commonwealth to obtain homes but will also bring the privilege of these benefits and restore justice to many who were previously deprived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members may remember that in the original second reading speech I spoke about <span class="highlight">families</span> whose income had been annihilated by drought and bushfire and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that it will be a matter for each university to determine who shall receive assistance, but I would expect that grants would be made available to students who are in extremely difficult financial circumstances following misfortune outside thencontrol such as death, injury, serious illness or desertion by breadwinners of <span class="highlight">families</span> on ordinary income; the annihilation of family income in flood, drough or bushfire; seasonal or chronic unemployment of the breadwinner; loss of earning power by the breadwinner for any other reason and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State of New South Wales produced a situation in which fees rose by  I6i  per cent, and this came as a very heavy blow at one university where the income of many <span class="highlight">families</span> was seriously affected by drought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is noteworthy that in this Bill not only students from low income <span class="highlight">families</span> can expect aid, but also special circumstances such as death, injury or serious illness of breadwinners can also be used as qualifications for financial assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From an administrative point of view, I think it would be preferable to involve high school principals in the decision of need because, firstly, they have generally known students and their <span class="highlight">families</span> for up to 6 years in an educational relationship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>You will appreciate the difficulties in catering for these boys, the estimated number within the range of 20 to 25 for each course, due to the fact that many come from low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and will be unable to attend full time courses unless they obtain some living allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, there are always minority groups coming from low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and <span class="highlight">families</span> that perhaps do not place sufficient emphasis on education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is also desired to give parents a full understanding of the reasons why their children need a higher level of training than has been required in the past so that they will provide encouragement for their <span class="highlight">families</span> to become more highly qualified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not in a position to challenge him as to whether that is right or wrong, but I would point out to the right honourable gentleman that whatever was achieved was achieved at very great cost to the 130,000 Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> which at that time found that a member of the family was unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Unlike the housing assistance offered to the States by the former Government, we propose, and the Agreement provides, that our assistance will henceforth be directed towards those <span class="highlight">families</span> and persons most in need of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No less than 85 per cent of the family homes to be built by State housing authorities with our advances will be allocated to <span class="highlight">families</span> where the average gross weekly income of the main bread-winner - exclusive of any overtime and child endowment payments - does not exceed 85 per cent of average weekly earnings per employed male unit as defined in the Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those eligible will be mainly the lower income <span class="highlight">families</span> who are paying too high a proportion of their incomes in private rents or are living in unsatisfactory accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">families</span> and persons include the majority of those in need of decent accommodation at a modest price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Agreement also provides that each State will ensure that the number of family dwellings allocated by its housing authority to <span class="highlight">families</span> who satisfy the needs test shall not be less than the total number of family dwellings built with our advances and become available during the year for allocation for the first time, and 25 per cent of the number of family dwellings constructed by the States with financial assistance under this and. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, we are most concerned to ensure that the benefit of our housing assistance in the form of a relatively very low rate of interest be passed on to needy <span class="highlight">families</span> and persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have suggested to the States that rents charged to <span class="highlight">families</span> with incomes close to the upper limit of the needs test should not exceed 22 per cent of those incomes and that the proportion of income paid in rent should be reduced as income declines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Government is firmly convinced that those most in need of housing assistance are <span class="highlight">families</span> and persons who are seeking rental accommodation, we are certainly not opposed to home-ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Under the proposed Agreement up to 30 per cent of the family dwellings built by housing authorities with our advances may be sold at a fair price to <span class="highlight">families</span> who satisfy the needs test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the most part, these will be <span class="highlight">families</span> who would be unable to borrow privately the finance they need to own their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In line with our policy of ensuring that our housing advances for welfare purposes benefit the more needy, applicants eligible to receive home builders’ account advances will be <span class="highlight">families</span> consisting of a married or engaged couple, or a single parent or guardian with one or more children, where the average gross weekly income of the main breadwinner, inclusive of overtime but excluding child endowment payments, does not exceed about 93 per cent of average weekly earnings, plus $2 a week for each child beyond the second. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the policy of the Government to avoid the development by State housing authorities of estates in which almost all the residents are in receipt of government housing assistance, and there is a tendency on the part of some people to regard <span class="highlight">families</span> living in those areas as being second class citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As, under the agreement, it is proposed that the Commonwealth Minister will determine the amount of welfare housing advances to a State during the next 5 years, the Australian Government will be able to ensure that an increasing flow of finance will be available to the States to enable them to expand the construction of homes for needy persons and <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This project would take out of the metropolitan area approximately 1,000 employees and their <span class="highlight">families</span> into a pollutant-free environment and provide a wonderful opportunity for the economic use of many natural resources within the Central Gippsland region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The previous Government was committed to measures with respect to retraining and reconstruction but many of the 8,600 farmers and their <span class="highlight">families</span> who left the land over the 5 years up to 1971-72 were virtually forced off their land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps only time will tell, and in 20 years time people may point to the speech I have made today and say that as there has been no increase in the number of broken <span class="highlight">families</span> and no increase in the number of divorces in our society I was well and truly out of touch. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Already the legislation of the Commonwealth, through broadening for social security purposes the definition of the term ‘widow’, provides for <span class="highlight">families</span> other than those where the family is fatherless as a consequence of the death of the father. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to express my grave concern about the increasing financial pressures being imposed upon the single income 2-parent <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I support this legislation for what it will do for the children of fatherless <span class="highlight">families</span>, I do urge the Government to look into the establishment of a far more comprehensive family benefits scheme whereby young mothers with very young children can, in effect, be paid to be at home providing the care that they wish to give to their children so that, instead of the community having to pay for substitute mothers, the natural mother of the child can provide care at home, certainly during the infant and pre-school days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We now have a situation where a widow or a person in receipt of this supporting mothers benefit will receive an income considerably more in excess of the acknowledged poverty levels than similar 2-parent single income <span class="highlight">families</span> with dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we need to look at them in a more sensible fashion and to adjust the benefits at levels according to the needs of the <span class="highlight">families</span> to enable them to spread their earning capacity in a way which permits them to provide their children with a reasonable standard of living at all stages of the family’s development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do want to place on record today the need for us to examine the deserving demand of the <span class="highlight">families</span> of the nation in order to place them in a position where they too can have financial benefits to provide their children with the home care and mother care which are so essential to their educational development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the benefit were across the board - available to the children of all <span class="highlight">families</span> - such an intrusion of the private lives of people would not be necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is a bit pathetic if, because some honourable members opposite are being found out in regard to their repudiation of an agreement, they now intend to follow a course of action presumably taken officially on behalf of the Opposition, which would have the effect of preventing the 95,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> who are waiting for housing commission homes around Australia from getting the assistance they urgently need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the same time they want to do the best for their children, and they cannot do the best for their children if one of the heaviest burdens upon them is the burden of maintaining the home within which they wish to bring up their young <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This would mean little difficulty except that certain local government areas may face special difficulties as a result of an influx of migrants or young <span class="highlight">families</span> who place greater demands on community services than do older people because the extra people outnumber the extra ratepayers in any such increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I mentioned when speaking on the second reading of the Housing Bill and also on the Defence Service Homes Bill, the fact that nearly 100,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> are waiting for homes is something that needs urgent and immediate attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The need for good quality, low rental accommodation for <span class="highlight">families</span> with low incomes is easily understood when one considers the economic factors operating in the housing industry at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Minister for Housing has stated, ‘unlike the housing assistance offered to the States by the former Government, we propose and the agreement provides that our assistance will henceforth be directed towards those <span class="highlight">families</span> and persons most in need of it’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No less than 85 per cent of the family homes to be built by the State Housing Authorities with our advances will be allocated to <span class="highlight">families</span> where the average gross weekly income of the main breadwinners will not exceed 85 per cent of average weekly earnings per employed male unit as defined in the agreement and, where the family includes 2 or more children, this will be increased by $2 a week for each child beyond the second. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those eligible are mainly the lower income <span class="highlight">families</span> who are paying too high a proportion of their incomes in private rents or are living in unsatisfactory accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst the Government is firmly convinced that those most in need of housing assistance are <span class="highlight">families</span> and persons who are seeking rental accommodation, we are certainly not opposed to home ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the proposed Agreement up to 30 per cent of the family dwellings built by the housing authorities with our advances may be sold at a fair price to <span class="highlight">families</span> who satisfy the needs test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the beading ‘Immediate Funds for Housing Agreements Soon’, which I believe is a presumption, the Minister for Housing  (Mr Les Johnson)  says that the purpose is to provide housing for letting to needy <span class="highlight">families</span> and persons, which is already a State housing commission role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Labor Government, as announced in the Budget Speech, will provide $60m assistance to the States by way of repayable loans, and $30m is promised by way of grants for the establishment of land commissions designed to provide Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> with land at fair prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His Government - of which he was Treasurer, let, us not forget - had the opportunity to halt inflation but his cure was to take jobs from Australian workers and to deprive their <span class="highlight">families</span> of a decent living standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Similarly, the reverse situation would apply if a rigid commitment were made as a matter of centralised policy making that the priority would be given to programs for the needs of the young <span class="highlight">families</span> while the needs of the aged were ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the rapid price increases have placed burdens on persons on low incomes, persons on fixed incomes, larger <span class="highlight">families</span> and pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever work we do we are all Australians with some common objectives and hopes for ourselves and for our <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this system those in the Australian workforce and their <span class="highlight">families</span> have had a protection for their wages, incomes and conditions of work unparalleled throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>About 11,100 <span class="highlight">families</span> are receiving assistance under the isolated childern’s scheme and this involves about 15,500 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of the 11,100 <span class="highlight">families</span> receiving assistance, about 4,223 <span class="highlight">families</span>, or 40 per cent, are receiving more than the basic $350. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government’s Department of Education has sent circulars to about 2,800 <span class="highlight">families</span> indicating that possibly they are entitled to the further additional assistance of $304 for secondary students or $200 for primary students beyond the $700. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government at present is allocating $100,000 a year to enable <span class="highlight">families</span> on correspondence who use transceivers to turn over to the new transceiver. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Interestingly enough, though the paternal <span class="highlight">families</span> were consulted, the arrangement was usually much more between the maternal <span class="highlight">families</span> of the boy and girl. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This impoverished situation exists not only in Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span> but also in white <span class="highlight">families</span> which are in similar positions, but, of course, it is much more predominant in Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frankly, given the universal acceptance that no improper motives or activities by management committees could possibly be involved - on the contrary that they have earned the highest respect and gratitude of residents, their <span class="highlight">families</span> and the Government alike - I have never been able to understand the general reticence of management committees on this question of taking residents into their confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many <span class="highlight">families</span> who are in need of domestic help and who do not meet the criterion of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of them are pioneers who have paid their taxes over the years, who have reared their <span class="highlight">families</span>, who have accepted their responsibilities in the past and who are now happy to stay in these homes, in which they are extremely well cared for, without having to accept any responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those men were there because they felt their entire future - the future of their farms, the future of their <span class="highlight">families</span>, their lives and their lifetime investment - was in doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This movement of staff will cause a lot of heartburning and disruption of homes and <span class="highlight">families</span> and possible setbacks in the careers of the displaced staff members concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker, this evening I wish to draw to your attention and to the attention of the House the added burdens that are being imposed by the present Government on young <span class="highlight">families</span> of this country and in particular young <span class="highlight">families</span> in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These burdens are being imposed in many directions on young <span class="highlight">families</span> seeking to establish homes, to buy them, to build them, to set them up and to bring up young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is another area in which young <span class="highlight">families</span> in South Australia are bearing a particular burden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a consequence, young <span class="highlight">families</span> expecting children are now faced with an added burden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an indirect form of placing an added burden on young <span class="highlight">families</span> which the Government indicated it would assist when seeking election prior to 2 December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Baker, the Prices Commissioner in South Australia, are, as he claimed, the recommendations of an expert, will he ensure that the Government contribution is such that added burdens are not placed on young <span class="highlight">families</span> in South Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister will not provide money to enable the difference to be made up out of government resources, will he grant approval to the benefit organisations in South Australia to increase their premiums so that the burden on young <span class="highlight">families</span>, who seek general practitioner attendance on confinements, can be reduced from $25 to $5, as is the case now if a young mother seeks specialist treatment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From October 1972 there were 50 Ugandan Asian <span class="highlight">families</span> in the ‘Endeavour’ hostel in Sydney and I think all honourable members will be pleased to know that only 10 <span class="highlight">families</span> remain at the hostel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was pitiful to see the <span class="highlight">families</span> which had spent years and years in the Latrobe Valley having to send their children away from home to get employment because employment opportunities had ceased as a result of the sabotage of the industry to which I have made reference and to which our friend has been alluding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is apparent to all that the program has been controlled by the motive of securing an affluent economy for the nation and virtually nothing has been done towards securing the welfare of migrant <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the age of fourteen or fifteen years, when they are most in need of communicating with their <span class="highlight">families</span> on the abstract and complex ideas of higher education and its demands, they find themselves unable to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some schools in these areas have up to one-third of their total enrolments made up of migrant children or children of migrant <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The needs of children from migrant <span class="highlight">families</span> whether they be Australian-born or not is one such area and the Australian Country Party is pleased to give its support to this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They must be in the schools and they must be part of that bridge building, which has been referred to, with the <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking of the <span class="highlight">families</span> involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Planning must be on a regional basis, not for large institutions, and be planned well away from <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present residential centres are seriously overcrowded and understaffed and yet they are still being pressured to admit more patients by <span class="highlight">families</span> who are waiting in desperate circumstances for a bed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only when we come in contact with these desperate <span class="highlight">families</span> and have witnessed the pressures they are under that we realise there is a great need in many cases for an extension of the number of beds available to these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until that time I had a fleeting understanding and a peripheral concern for the <span class="highlight">families</span> of handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fourth category is: Register - <span class="highlight">families</span> are coping with the retarded child, placement may never be necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real danger area, according to the social workers’ report, is the list of 525 <span class="highlight">families</span> in varying degrees of desperation on the urgent and most urgent waiting lists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that this will not involve the reduction in our living standards which we have been inclined to accept by having an economic system which compels so many young mothers, against their inclinations, to go out to work to support their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem is compounded because most of the <span class="highlight">families</span> are young and are paying for houses at a time when the home repayments form a high proportion of their incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the Committee are concerned at the great problem that the payment of death duties causes to small <span class="highlight">families</span>, particularly to women who unfortunately through a sudden death find themselves widowed and left to shoulder the burden of rearing a young family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They comprised a number of <span class="highlight">families</span> and their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was told that there were 45 <span class="highlight">families</span> that needed housing immediately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Explicit or implicit means tests do not allow legal services to be given to the very groups in most need of them, and I’m talking about men on the basic wage, deserted wives and working men with large <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The New South Wales Government makes a grant to <span class="highlight">families</span> of $88 per child if the child is going to a private secondary school if the parental income is below $7,000 a year - this is the grant that will commence under the new New South Wales Budgetbut it is of no advantage to the school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New South Wales grants $75 a head to schools at the primary level and at the post primary level it grants $88 for <span class="highlight">families</span> towards paying their children’s fees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The areas involved are low income earning <span class="highlight">families</span>, people receiving unemployment, sickness and special benefits and migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are thousands of 2-children <span class="highlight">families</span> in the community in which both parents are working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be that as it may, the point I seek to make here is that while we are committed to a broad based education of high quality, improving the opportunities for all children, especially those who come from disadvantaged <span class="highlight">families</span> and disadvantaged groups and especially those who require special treatment and specially trained teachers - matters which we put in train over a year ago - and while we are committed to better conditions in schools, to which we became committed over a year ago, we are not necessarily committed to the techniques and methods which the Minister is using to achieve the result that he thinks to be necessary, because we are not committed to centralisation of education in the Commonwealth’s hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe, firmly in instilling in all <span class="highlight">families</span> a concern for the needs of education and a desire to encourage their children to maximise their potential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These schools enrol a shade over 2 per cent of the nation’s learners and, at a good guess, at least 80 per cent of the <span class="highlight">families</span> involved are either well-to-do, rich or completely loaded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These increased monthly repayments might come at a stage of their lives when their <span class="highlight">families</span> are growing up and they are faced with extra expense in settling them in life or in making higher education available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, through the Minister for Housing, has expressed a desire to assist <span class="highlight">families</span> on low incomes with their housing problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another very important aspect of the Housing Agreement with the States is that not less than 85 per cent of the homes to be built must be allocated to <span class="highlight">families</span> where the average gross weekly income of the main breadwinner, exclusive of overtime and child endowment payments, does not exceed 85 per cent of average weekly earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of this condition those eligible for homes mainly will be the lower income <span class="highlight">families</span> who now are paying too high a proportion of their income in private rents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is estimated that at present the provision of these homes trails by 41 years the requirement of houses by individual Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We realise also that a nation as prosperous as Australia should not be faced with the present position and that in the years to come every endeavour should be made to close the gap between the demand and the supply of homes for individual <span class="highlight">families</span> by the Government supplying homes at the moderate cost I have set out in my speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an enormous increase in the allocation for welfare housing, and it signifies tha great priority which the Federal Labor Government puis on providing housing for <span class="highlight">families</span> with a limited income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the Opposition would let the private housing sector have its head, and to hell with the hapless <span class="highlight">families</span> -who are queueing up for public housing from State housing commissions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is quite a simple policy to implement, provided one is prepared to disregard the neediest <span class="highlight">families</span> in the community - and that is just what the Liberal government’s record shows they did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should mention also that the Government will be introducing another important measure to assist low income <span class="highlight">families</span> in particular to own their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill before the House and the Government’s housing policies are aimed at diverting the provision of homes to <span class="highlight">families</span> with limited incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we have to be quite ruthless in this field and quite heavy handed with our foreign exchange regulations to ensure that foreign capital coming into Australia is not used to make residential land more expensive for Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is something we could look at because I believe it could mean a great deal of financial relief to young <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are doing time in the Northern Territory and they are moved from the Northern Territory to a gaol in South Australia and their <span class="highlight">families</span> do not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well known thai because of the failure of the previous Government to complete the acquisition of all land in the Australian Capital Territory years ago so that it could be properly developed for houses to be built on it for <span class="highlight">families</span> and people who wanted to live the good life, some pockets of land remained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some 60 or 70 <span class="highlight">families</span> were thought to be involved but the township of Woomera has other functions and it has been designed specifically for fluctuations of this sort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that there are odd <span class="highlight">families</span> in financial crisis - largely <span class="highlight">families</span> that have been left in this crisis because of the failure of Commonwealth Governments in the past to cope with this crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In those <span class="highlight">families</span> there is positive starvation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a question of calcium and protein deficiency; it is a question of those <span class="highlight">families</span> not having enough money to buy food. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Coombs Task Force and the Cabinet have agreed that it is far better to save this Si 2m - the cost has grown in 20 years from $3m to $12m - and make some provision for <span class="highlight">families</span> in need than to try to force milk down the throats of those who do not want it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An article in the ‘Australian’ of 2 October this year carried the heading ‘A long, hungry winter for U.S. <span class="highlight">families</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because emergency services, such as hospitals, ambulances, police, and fire departments would have priority over the common man in getting petrol, oil gas and electricity, whole <span class="highlight">families</span> would suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Consequently the Government intends that care in the community should henceforth be placed, in effect, at ‘shop-front’ clinics and, indeed, ‘at the door-step’ of <span class="highlight">families</span> which might otherwise delay going to an institution for help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But let me concentrate for a moment on what I consider to be our most serious immediate economic problem - a problem reaching disastrous proportions - intiation, increasing costs and prices undermining the social welfare of ordinary Australians, <span class="highlight">families</span>, young and old; inflation with its crippling costs bearing down on industry and services; inflation undermining the morals of the people and leading to inevitable restlessness and industrial troubles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In an electorate such as mine, where there is a large number of young <span class="highlight">families</span>, there are many kindergarten committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the developing suburbs in my own electorate are a large number of young <span class="highlight">families</span> coming from all walks of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed phasing out of the means test would make the age allowance even more anomalous, and the benefits which it now provides to some aged persons with quite large incomes even more inequitable by comparison with the position of young married couples setting up home and raising <span class="highlight">families</span> on the same or smaller incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that we should take up the slack in times of stress but that we should not be making the pace and ensuring that other areas of administration - State parliaments and local governments - and individual <span class="highlight">families</span> and the people themselves have less in materials, in time and certainly in money with which to carry out the work that they want carried out for their own personal and family benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, the Opposition believes that this question of mental illness is something that impacts itself upon human beings and upon <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is one of the greatest tragedies that can impact itself upon <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So, for low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, the difficulties of the passage through university of their children will, I think, be just as hard and just as great. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that it is difficult to tackle this specific problem, but I doubt whether the Government’s objective of providing assistance to <span class="highlight">families</span> or individual students who would not have been able to receive such help under the previous scheme will be achieved by this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general it provided financial assistance for secondary education to those <span class="highlight">families</span> least in need of such assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also needs to be recognised that on average students from high income or higher status <span class="highlight">families</span> will stay longer at school and perform better on tests of scholastic achievement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The awards under this scheme cannot be looked at in isolation; they must be looked at in conjunction with the foreshadowed legislation whereby assistance will be given to students who come from low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the high school, one in which I taught, a great number of the students came from the homes of <span class="highlight">families</span> on a low income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would personally hope that this type of financial assistance to secondary students will be phased out after 1974 and that the money that is at present being used for this purpose will be given to students of <span class="highlight">families</span> on low incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I imagine that the policy that the Government is espousing is that it is trying to help the children of <span class="highlight">families</span> who could not attend post secondary and tertiary institutions if they had to pay fees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Students from poorer <span class="highlight">families</span>, who are grossly unrepresented in the university intake, have a financial as well as an academic barrier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only conclusion that can be drawn is that among tertiary students of all kinds the children of manual workers are under-represented and those of higher status <span class="highlight">families</span> over-represented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The process in which the social selectivity of tertiary institutions is as an end point of education goes back into the schools and beyond them, into the <span class="highlight">families</span> where children are conceived and raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I represent an area in which many of the <span class="highlight">families</span> have raised their level of aspiration for their student children to as high as university level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we are to detect need in children we must face the fact that <span class="highlight">families</span> most at risk are least likely to go voluntarily to infant welfare clinics, least likely to use child care centres, least likely to have the services of competent medical practitioners, social workers or phychological advisers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If those pensioners entitled to benefits under the pensioner medical service were to be covered by the subsidised health insurance program - assuming that were possible because every effort to cover all people so far has failed with only four in every 100 low income <span class="highlight">families</span> being covered so far - many of them would in fact be squeezed out because the income eligibility levels are much lower than they are for the pensioner medical service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In many inner city suburbs where there are large <span class="highlight">families</span>, where often 2 parents are working or where large concentrations of migrants are living, it is essential to provide satisfactory pre-school centres staffed by adequately trained teachers who can apply themselves to problems which face these young people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surveys conducted by the Inner Suburban Education Committee in Melbourne have shown how a comparatively small number of schools which include Melbourne’s oldest, least well equipped and least generously staffed schools, have been obliged to bear the brunt not only of the influx of children who speak little or no English, but also of the children from low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and broken <span class="highlight">families</span> who are attracted to the inner suburbs of Melbourne and Sydney by the availabilaity of low cost housing commission accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting that the Inner Suburban Education Committee identified, among the enrolments of these schools, a great proportion of large <span class="highlight">families</span> and a great proportion of <span class="highlight">families</span> in which only one parent or the other was present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The result is that whether one looks to retention rates or to the students who are able to proceed to a tertiary education, one finds that children who come from lower socio-economic status <span class="highlight">families</span> are in no way proportionate to their numbers in the overall population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition to the greatly increased capital, recurrent and library grants which will apply to almost all students, there will be extra millions of dollars in each of these and other aspects of education for those in disadvantaged schools - children of lower income <span class="highlight">families</span>, many migrants with low incomes and language and social adjustment problems, Aborigines and children living in isolated areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My amendment continues:  and that therefore this Bill and associated Bills should be withdrawn, because the Government’s alternative proposals to the existing health scheme will (a) lower the quality of medical care for Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>, (b) increase total costs for the Government and thus for taxpayers, (c) increase total costs for the majority of taxpayers, because they could only maintain the present quality of their health care by additional heavy commitments for private insurance, (d) reduce freedom of choice, (e) jeopardize the future of religious, private and country hospitals and (f) by design and intent be the first stage of nationalisation of health and medical care in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most importantly, as I said at the outset, we claim that the Labor scheme will lower the quality of medical care for Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Private hospitals will have empty beds because the cost of additional insurance for private hospital treatment to Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> will necessarily be so heavy that they will simply be unable to afford intermediate or private ward accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will add to their taxes and force most of them and their <span class="highlight">families</span> into public wards whereas 70 per cent of them already choose to insure for intermediate or private accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will lower the standards of health care for the majority of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister says that his scheme will be cheaper for 3 out of 4 <span class="highlight">families</span> and 7 out of 10 single people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the costs I have quoted, let the Minister do what he has refused to do to date and make available to the House the statistics which show that his scheme will be cheaper for 3 out of 4 <span class="highlight">families</span> and 7 out of 10 single people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it will result in a lowering of the standard of health care for Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister has sought to claim that this scheme will be less expensive for 75 per cent of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has made a great deal of an argument, without providing facts, that 3 out of 4 Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>” would pay less under his system, but that is to say that they would pay less for what he is offering, which is standard ward treatment in a public hospital and, perhaps, in a private hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In countries where medical expenses are still met from personal purses with or without an element of private insurance, any long or complicated illness may spell financial ruin for <span class="highlight">families</span> which, until the illness, were not poor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It does nothing to solve the problem of <span class="highlight">families</span> who are faced with crippling bills for elderly relatives in nursing homes which charge more than the standard fees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 22 November last I asked the Minister to table in this House the documents and calculations on which he based his assertions that health insurance under his proposals will be cheaper for 3 out of 4 <span class="highlight">families</span> and 7 out of 10 single persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the new program we can not only make a general rule which is equitable, but we can also provide for further exemptions for low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and other special groups, which leave everyone protected but which do not add significantly to administrative costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Several groups, including <span class="highlight">families</span> in which the wife works, will pay more for a service that will not be as good as the present scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a system will only continue if <span class="highlight">families</span> are able to pay for extra private insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We consider many <span class="highlight">families</span> will be prevented by the scheme from doing this, especially when both husband and wife are working and both pay the 1.35 per cent levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such <span class="highlight">families</span> will seek admissions to public hospitals, which will adversely affect the concept of a dual system and also impose unnecessary burdens on accommodation available in public hospitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister places no significance whatsoever on the <span class="highlight">families</span> of these workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, there are at least 2 studies which indicate that the intake of milk is greater on average among low income <span class="highlight">families</span> than among high income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The evidence today is that this is not so except in those <span class="highlight">families</span> who are literally starving, who are so poverty stricken that they cannot get even adequate calories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the sorts of deprivation that are evident in the more deprived <span class="highlight">families</span> in the community, we believe that the $12m spent on the scheme last year, which would increase every year, is far better spent on the sorts of benefits that have been brought forward under our social security policy to help low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and to enable them to choose their priorities for nutrition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme will operate to the disadvantage of <span class="highlight">families</span> where the husband and wife are both working, as they will each pay 1.35 per cent of their net taxable incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My colleague will also point out the hypocrisy of a Party which carps at the grant to the Government’s insurance program from Consolidated Revenue and which at the same time proposes to cover the services of pensioners and other low-income <span class="highlight">families</span> in the most expensive possible way by the reckless infusion of another SI 80m or so into existing private insurance funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member may support the Bill which has been introduced in another place by the Democratic Labor Party, by which it is proposed that the Australian Government subsidise private insurance contributions of <span class="highlight">families</span> on incomes up to $69.50 a week and single persons up to $30 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, the people in those areas are denied medical care when they or their <span class="highlight">families</span> need it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand the thrust of this Bill, it provides for the establishment of these centres by the Commonwealth in order that those people and their <span class="highlight">families</span> can be attended to when they are ill or need medical care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The utilisation patterns of 31 multiproblem <span class="highlight">families</span> were studied for 30 continuous months of comprehensive care provided by a family-oriented health tare team (physicians, nurse, health aide, and social worker), with continuity, co-ordination, and constant availability of care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The changing pattern of medical care behaviour of these <span class="highlight">families</span> created an effective utilisation of allied health personnel, with physician-sparing results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is more likely that those people, especially mothers of large <span class="highlight">families</span>, deny themselves medical services because they do not wish to embarrass their <span class="highlight">families</span> financially. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Have any of them left <span class="highlight">families</span> in Colombia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, what action does the Minister propose regarding these <span class="highlight">families</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I give the honourable member this assurance: I hope in the next few weeks to be able to determine the cases with a view to seeing that justice is done to the migrants and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member is quite right - the <span class="highlight">families</span> are still in Colombia, wondering very much what is going to happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In still other cases, of course, there are special circumstances within <span class="highlight">families</span> which necessitate children attending boarding schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we have decided, on the advice of experts in the National Health and Medical Research Council and in the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine in Sydney who have actually sponsored surveys in this area using school medical services and other sources, that it would be more productive to use the money which has been dissipated in this area to upgrade the services available to <span class="highlight">families</span> that are in fact suffering from malnutrition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the school milk scheme and despite all the other schemes which have been adopted on an across the board basis, we believe that the proper way to assist <span class="highlight">families</span> that are nutritionally in trouble is through the Australian Assistance Plan which will discriminate in favour of those <span class="highlight">families</span> that need help and give them the sort of help they need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This meeting of representatives of Australian Federal and State Public Service Organisations representing over 400,000 public servants and their .<span class="highlight">families</span> throughout Australia rejects any attempt to repudiate the Australian Government’s clear undertaking to introduce a new quantum and conditions of long service leave for Australian Government public servants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With that awareness, I extend the season’s greetings to all members of this great institution, the Australian Parliament, and to those who serve it and to their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This will result in fewer Aboriginal children having to leave home to attend school, and those who must still live away from home will at least be within easier reach of their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-72-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will he investigate the possibility of making low interest loans available to <span class="highlight">families</span> wishing to install such a flat for their parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-72-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is understood that in one State a scheme is being developed under which the State Housing Authority will build self-contained flats for aged parents on their <span class="highlight">families</span>’ blocks on a rental basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-72-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If these evictions take place, will it (a) affect the schooling of the <span class="highlight">families</span> of strikers and disrupt family life, (b) cause hardship by way of cost of transfer of household effects and (c) cause further industrial unrest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-72-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(a) and (b) Had these evictions been enforced and the employees and their <span class="highlight">families</span> been required to move elsewhere the education of the children, and the family life of the people involved, would obviously have been affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-72-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned that companies could consider utilising employee entitlements such as the provision of accommodation as an industrial weapon with which to threaten workers and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-72-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  professionalism then restored many ill bodies and his understanding and kindness removed much worry without in any way causing any sense of embarrassment for patients’ <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I express sympathy to the <span class="highlight">families</span> and relatives of those who lost their lives in the recent floods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is asking pensioners, fixed income earners and lower income <span class="highlight">families</span> to cope with increases in food prices of 23 per cent a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that some 100,000 <span class="highlight">families</span>, covering I would presume 400,000 people, will be waiting for homes at the end of the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to add the sympathy of the Government to the men, women and <span class="highlight">families</span> in his electorate, particularly in such large cities as Lismore and Murwillumbah, who have now been stricken as were so many people further north a month and two months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Three factors were evident in his excellent report: The unbelievably high proportion of aged people, the growing numbers of young <span class="highlight">families</span> with children and the need to provide improved health care in the community and at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As can be appreciated, with an average annual increase in population within this western area of 25,000 people, practically all of whom are young people with young <span class="highlight">families</span>, the probems associated with the hospitalisation and care of children are practically impossible to surmount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir, you  would have been equally astonished to hear the honourable member for Henty advocating the discredited system of Commonwealth secondary scholarships which this Government has replaced with a system of bursaries for low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The system was a betrayal not only of logic and humanity, but also of the wish of Prime Minister Menzies that secondary scholarships should provide assistance for needy students and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">families</span> of 100,000 Australians lost their incomes, some of them for a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a direct result of Government policy it is estimated that 100,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> or 400,000 people in this country will be waiting for homes at the end of this calendar year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">families</span> will be either unable to obtain the funds required because those funds are not available or unable to borrow because they cannot afford the increased cost of borrowing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, of course, there was the willing response of the Federal Government in regard to the providing of immediate relief for <span class="highlight">families</span> amounting to $3,000 a family and $15,000 a household in respect of major repairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such policy initiatives, which the Minister claims to have introduced, as the development of new and expanded welfare services, the schools program, the examination of the problems of over 60 inner city schools in Melbourne, the emergency telephone service, expanded facilities for teaching English, the policy of re-union of <span class="highlight">families</span> - which was announced in 1968  -  and expanded migrant counselling services were all announced before the Minister came to power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another effect that this second class status has on the system is that people who come to technical colleges tend to come from poorer <span class="highlight">families</span> which cannot afford the true costs of technical education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been necessary to create special courses for these mature people who in many cases have already raised <span class="highlight">families</span> but who wish to stay in their chosen occupation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is forcing women to work at -the expense of their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By stealth it is impoverishing the nation and impoverishing in particular the young who are seeking to buy their homes and bring up their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Likewise their <span class="highlight">families</span>, if they are young, will, of course, face an impossible situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We, as the majority of people, can look only at what is good for the majority - which comprises ourselves and our <span class="highlight">families</span> as citizens of Western Australia - and df we look at the facts and statistics of what has occurred for the good of the general population since the inception of the Labor Government, we will indeed be loath to see any diminution of this progress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inevitable increases that took place in the prices of staple items in the budgets of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> then generated claims for wage and salary increases which could not in equity be denied by our wage fixing authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the policy of the reunion of <span class="highlight">families</span> was first mentioned and emphasised by the present Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  in 1968. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would remind honourable members that until we came into office, it was part of a conscious policy pursued by previous LiberalCountry Party governments to maintain unemployment benefits at a depressed level so that there would be enormous financial pressure and social stress on <span class="highlight">families</span> - the people who had to live in the inadequate rate of benefit - to go and take any sort of work at all, no matter whether it was of a lower status than that which they normally pursued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister ensure that the needs of school children from low income <span class="highlight">families</span> are fully protected by the Australian Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The one million Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> who are likely to benefit from the tax deductibility of mortgage interest rates will certainly not acquiesce in the honourable member’s contention that the proposal is socially regressive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas 40,000 grants were made in 1972-73 under the homes savings grant scheme, one million <span class="highlight">families</span> will be assisted under the scheme I mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was for the disabled and for the <span class="highlight">families</span> of those who died that the repatriation system was created over 50 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They must consider their <span class="highlight">families</span>, their husbands and the occupations of their husbands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More than one million <span class="highlight">families</span> will benefit from the tax deductibility scheme, not on one occasion only but every year they have a mortgage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We maintain that the children of Australia are entitled to decent housing and that adequate help should be given to the <span class="highlight">families</span> of those children to achieve that end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore the more to be regretted that he chose to involve himself today in an attempt to palm off on this Government the blame for the shortages of housing by which so many Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> are currently disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is increasing evidence that sufficiently widespread motivation for limiting family size cannot be produced without more <span class="highlight">families</span> becoming aware that their standard of living is rising, including benefiting from a higher level of education, especially for women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To be ranked (1) in political rights it has to be assumed that the great majority of persons or <span class="highlight">families</span> in the state have both rights and opportunities to participate in the electoral process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Public statements by the Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and the repeated failure of the Cabinet to accept the Superannuation Board’s recommendations on at least 4 occasions have led to widespread anxiety amongst both past and present Commonwealth public servants and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am glad that the <span class="highlight">families</span> of deceased members who were, at the time of their death, either beneficiaries receiving benefits from the Fund or indeed were contributors due for lump sums are to receive a benefit from this distribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When these men received salary increases they were automatically entitled to take out additional superannuation units, and because they did not know what the future would hold they felt, for the protection of their wives and <span class="highlight">families</span>, that they had to take these units and contribute to the Superannuation Fund at higher rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What has happened is that this Government and this Minister have approved rising charges to patients but have done nothing to reduce the gap between the Governnent subsidy and the charges which the patients or their <span class="highlight">families</span> must pay for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed it would throw out the tax deduction scheme which is going to provide benefits to the tune of SI 20m a year to well over one million Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did he receive a letter from  Mr Thompson,  former Minister for Community Welfare in Western Australia, requesting that a subsidy be paid to <span class="highlight">families</span> based on the number of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-42-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, did  Mr Thompson  assert that this would overcome the fact that women with large <span class="highlight">families</span> could receive more money if their husbands deserted them or were unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-42-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer to the right honourable member’s question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) I have no record of having received a letter from  Mr Thompson,  former Minister for Community Welfare in Western Australia, requesting that a subsidy be paid to <span class="highlight">families</span> based on the number of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-42-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was felt that more oppropriate funding could be made to <span class="highlight">families</span> who were in special need through our social security program and other measures which the Government was undertaking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it would lower the quality of medical care for Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>; it would increase total costs for the Government and thus for all taxpayers; it would increase total costs for the majority of taxpayers, because they could only maintain the present quality of their health care by additional heavy commitments for private insurance after having paid the 1.35 per cent super tax; it would reduce freedom of choice and it would jeopardise the future of religious, private and country hospitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, we claim that the Labor scheme will lower the quality of medical care for Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The main objectives of the purchase of the estate are to avoid the sudden displacing of the existing population and to avoid any disruption to existing community networks, and to retain the opportunity for low income earners and <span class="highlight">families</span> and aged people to live close to the city as part of the wider community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make the point that on the one hand we have a meat industry which is being rapidly forced into bankruptcy while on the other hand the consumers of Australia, the housewives - we are concerned for the housewives - and their <span class="highlight">families</span>, have to put up with high meat prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only are the Government’s policies causing severe damage to the industry; they are also grossly inflating the price of housing and eating into the accommodation available to low income and needy <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will discriminate against <span class="highlight">families</span> with children as compared with those without children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Revised figures just made available to me by the Treasury now put the number of <span class="highlight">families</span> who will benefit from the scheme at 1.4 million and the annual cost at $130m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Snedden does not seem to worry about the one million <span class="highlight">families</span> who would lose $250 a year or $5 a week if Labor’s home mortgage tax deductibility scheme is not introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, it was the Minister himself who said in an election campaign that one million <span class="highlight">families</span> would receive $250 each. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The likely employment prospects for migrants and their <span class="highlight">families</span> are surely an important consideration in ensuring that the migrant is satisfactorily integrated into the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He gave no direct answer to that very great problem which confronts a large number of the elderly sick in our community, and the <span class="highlight">families</span> who have a concern for their welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that puts in proper perspective what 1 have been contending, namely, that the $250 rebate will be not for every one of the one million <span class="highlight">families</span> but for the average family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  now tells me that it is more likely to cost $130m and to benefit not the one million <span class="highlight">families</span> I contended would be the likely beneficiaries but 1.4 million <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those 2 statements are not in contradiction; they are only a further implication that there are one million average wage-earning <span class="highlight">families</span>, all of whom would benefit by $250 a year or $5 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The investigation that was carried out by social workers and welfare organisations in the municipalities of Springvale, Dandenong and Berwick showed that the groups most affected were, as one might imagine, the one parent <span class="highlight">families</span>, particularly deserted wives; <span class="highlight">families</span> who were evicted from their houses; the elderly; and also, in areas like those centred in Dandenong, quite a large group of young people and <span class="highlight">families</span> who come to those areas in the expectation of easy employment because cities such as Dandenong are reputed to be boom cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People have lost their life savings and their businesses, and <span class="highlight">families</span> have been broken up, all as a result of participation in pyramid selling schemes - schemes that were presented as sure-fire successes but which, as far as the participants were concerned, were doomed to failure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 preface my question, which  is directed to the Minister for Housing and Construction, by asking him to bear in mind that the Prime Minister is on record as saying at the Premiers Conference that more low income <span class="highlight">families</span> are to be given the opportunity tobuy homes of their own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the Minister’s answer to the honourable member for Isaacs, will the Minister acknowledge that he has before him numerous requests for both subsistence expenditure and capital expenditure for new and existing child care centres and pre-schools, particularly a number from my own electorate with its large number of 2- income earner <span class="highlight">families</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since that time the situation has deteriorated very markedly to the point where aged sick people and their <span class="highlight">families</span> in some instances have been paying as much as $60 to $100 a week over and above their pension income in order to have the type of accommodation that they deserve and require. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People, the sick aged and their <span class="highlight">families</span> and those who understood the problem, spoke out and took action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what about the additional fees that patients and their <span class="highlight">families</span> are committed to pay in respect of the weeks leading up to 1 August? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did not provide the necessary subsidies, such as housekeeper services and so on, to help people who did not have <span class="highlight">families</span> to look after them or who had <span class="highlight">families</span> who could not care less about their aged parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everything costs the same for <span class="highlight">families</span>, regardless of morals, and I do not think we should stand in judgment on them when we are handing down pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Minister for Labor and Immigration gets up in this chamber and boasts that because of these economic stresses these women with young <span class="highlight">families</span> have been forced to take employment which they would not take of their own choice, I find it, if I may say so, a little distasteful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Government is doing this it should look at the whole structure of the tax scale at the bottom end so that those <span class="highlight">families</span> with small incomes also have the benefit of paying no tax on an income which can only be described as meagre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consider the situation of a young person with a wife and several children, who has to pay off a house and pay for furniture, a car - an essential item for most people these days, just by the nature of labour requirements - education, health and a multitude of obligations which we all accept, and gladly accept, in our desire to give our <span class="highlight">families</span> an opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So their <span class="highlight">families</span> got together and raised the necessary resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Families</span> with a gross weekly income of $68:50 or less will not have to pay health insurance fund contributions at all, provided they apply for the subsidy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been occurring in the community already that young <span class="highlight">families</span>, knowing that the wife is expecting a baby, book into a hospital and insure up to the total limit sufficient to cover the hospital bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They know of its ability to wreck <span class="highlight">families</span> and drain friendships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I am concerned that the high cost of accommodation is preventing <span class="highlight">families</span> on low incomes from taking a holiday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-45-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This represents an average across the nation level of 10.2 per cent of <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rural Australia accounts for 142,000 of those 399,000 below the poverty line <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So 14.4 per cent of rural <span class="highlight">families</span> are below the poverty line compared with the national average of 10.2 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>employed <span class="highlight">families</span> whose breadwinner’s gross income does not exceed $121 per week or where there are more than two dependent children $121 per week with an additional allowance of $2 per week for each dependent child in excess of two. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-36-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The additional cost of that extra insurance is an allowable deduction for taxation purposes and that cost, with the basic levy of 1.35 per cent of taxable income, for most people in the community and for most <span class="highlight">families</span> will still be less than the cost of hospital and medical insurance under the present scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The subsidised health insurance program at best could cover only four out of every 100 low income <span class="highlight">families</span> which it was supposed to cover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every baby born in Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> requires hospitalisation and the best of medical care for mother and child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The points we made were, firstly, that it would lower the quality of medical care to Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>; second, that it would increase the total cost to the Government and thus to the taxpayer; third, that it would increase the cost to an individual because, in addition to increased taxation, expensive additional private insurance would be required to maintain health care standards; fourth, that it would reduce the freedom of choice of doctors and hospitals; fifth, that it would jeopardise the future of religious, private and country hospitals; and, sixth, that it would be the first stage of nationalisation of health care in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present the bulk of the population must insure themselves and their <span class="highlight">families</span> through one of the multiplicity of health insurance funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is a personal responsibility, and it is for each and every one of us for ourselves and our <span class="highlight">families</span> to accept that responsibility; but surely it is also a responsibility that should be shared by Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are people who, in the main, are the sorts of people for whom the community must take responsibility- age pensioners, single mothers, people on low incomes with large <span class="highlight">families</span> and people who just do not think about the necessity for cover and who are irresponsible but who, with this Government’s scheme, will be forced to discipline themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every word we heard this morning from the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  and the Opposition spokesman on health and social security, the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp),  showed clearly that they are out of touch with the health care services upon which an overwhelming majority of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> are obliged to rely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members opposite are no more able to understand the state of ordinary medical and hospital services to which they would never dream of entrusting themselves or their <span class="highlight">families</span> than they are able to understand the ordinary schools to which they would never send their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The possibility of restraint from all sections of the community will be enhanced by the decisions I will announce designed to reduce the burdens on and increase the benefits for wage earners and particularly low and single income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In addition to the reductions in tax on low incomes in general under the new rate scale, we see a particular need for tax relief to low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-57-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The total cost to revenue of the restructuring of the rate scale and the special rebate for low income <span class="highlight">families</span> is of the order of $430 million on a full-year basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-57-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The great majority of wage and salary earners, and especially lowincome single-income <span class="highlight">families</span>, will pay less tax as a result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-57-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all for employees we have ensured a rise in their real standard of living as members of the Australian community, as members of <span class="highlight">families</span>, as parents, as city dwellers, as public transport users and as road users. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Inflation causes uncertainty and even fear from which few members of the community can be exempt, least of all employees and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But what the situation calls for is a lot more versatility on the part of the private sector and a greater preparedness to work in a co-operative way with the Housing Commission so that we can fulfil our aspiration to break down the waiting list for low income <span class="highlight">families</span> who have been seeking houses for such a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe, as does the Minister, that the people of Australia want to get down and work and that the <span class="highlight">families</span>, wives and children of people employed in industry, whether it be the building industry or any other, want to be able to rely on receiving a weekly income that is not interfered with by any person outside or any influence which they themselves do not commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No government can meet the great clamour from the people for better services, better education, better welfare services, better defence, better roads and all the rest of it, while it does so many things to damage the nation’s productive capacity, to discourage people from investing their earnings and their savings in producing industries, and to persuade people that they are wrong, if not stupid, to seek to advance themselves and their <span class="highlight">families</span> through hard work and thrift. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s decision to reduce the income tax deduction for education expenses strikes not only at the non-government schools, which was its intention, motivated by the desire to restrict freedom of choice, but also at the young mothers and the single parent <span class="highlight">families</span> who depend on pre-schools and kindergartens, which are often costly, while they make a living to support their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that respect I do not mean the boarding schools in the traditional sense that many honourable members on the Government side of the chamber immediately think of, but the boarding schools which are of social value to children of broken homes, in particular, and to the children of <span class="highlight">families</span> who live in country areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While we recognise on the one hand that there is an enormous number of mothers in this community who are obliged to go out to work by economic circumstances and who have a pressing need for child care centres, equally there is an enormous number of women in the community who would simply welcome an occasional break away from their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to put to the Government for considerationI do not say this in any critical sense- the proposition that an examination might be made of our social services to see whether it is possible to give some incentive to <span class="highlight">families</span> to care to a much greater extent for the elderly members of their <span class="highlight">families</span> in their own home environments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am in total agreement with him that the home environment is undoubtedly the ideal one, but with so many <span class="highlight">families</span> now in small homes and so many parents working it is not feasible for a large number of elderly people to live with their relatives, and therefore we desperately need homes for the aged where they can retain independence and nursing homes for those who are no longer able to care for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>True most of those retrenched are the second wage earners in the family and even then their wages are being continued for 6 months by the Government but how few <span class="highlight">families</span> can afford a sudden cut in income now or in 6 months and how many of the women retrenched are, in fact, supporting their <span class="highlight">families</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-49-2">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether the Minister is interested in this problem, but it seems to me to be the nub of the issue of the Government’s making money available to low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both of these factors are working against housing not in the sense of bricks and mortar but in the sense of <span class="highlight">families</span> wanting to obtain them, whether they are well-to-do <span class="highlight">families</span> or poor <span class="highlight">families</span> because everyone has the right to purchase a home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It still seems that Hargreave’s Law applies with respect to the family situation and it still seems that <span class="highlight">families</span> with more than the average number of children tend to be poorer <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is obviously much easier for people who are in receipt of a more substantial income to provide housing for themselves and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This comparison, more than anything else, illustrates the commitment which this Labor Government has to housing <span class="highlight">families</span> of limited financial means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But they certainly do prove that home ownership for low income <span class="highlight">families</span> was a nonexistent priority for the last Liberal-Country Party Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added to that is a further $60m special rebate for lower income <span class="highlight">families</span> and another $ 130m is lost in revenue as a result of the new mortgage interest payments deduction scheme which is also involved in the Bills about to come before the House for consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The special rebate is to assist low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and the mortgage interest payments deduction is also structured so that the proportion of payment that can be claimed as a tax deduction is reduced by 1 per cent for each $ 100 of net income over $4,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The first relates to the surcharge on property income contained in the Income Tax Bill, which has just been passed, and the second relates to the rebate for low income taxpayers with <span class="highlight">families</span> as proposed in the Income Tax Assessment Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In other words, those who thought that they had protection for their <span class="highlight">families</span> by providing certain life insurance with established bonuses flowing to those policies in response to certain policy commitments, now in the twilight of their lives find that these benefits are being rapidly eroded not only by inflation but also by the actions of this Government which is taking away bonus benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But when one looks at what these proposals have done to the small people and to the honest Australians who have tried to protect their <span class="highlight">families</span> into the future, one finds that these actions go very much beyond the philosophy that I have just mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But, for the purposes of a political exercise, in order to achieve leverage, the Premier of Victoria refused one of his instrumentalities the right to recruit labour in a situation which would relieve unemployment and thus give the <span class="highlight">families</span> of those people who would be employed the wherewithal to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are: Firstly, the maintenance of those parties and their children unable to support themselves without social security assistance; secondly, the administrative costs associated with increased demands upon either the existing legal system or the establishment of the Family Court of Australia; thirdly, the increased demands upon the Australian Legal Aid Office, as is provided for in clause 117(3) and (4); fourthly, the probable increased demand for child care centres; and, fifthly, the increased demand for services to deal with the psychological and physical ill-health of disadvantaged one-parent <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Aristotle saw the village as a union of <span class="highlight">families</span> and the state as a union of villages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The family unit produced stability for the overall society and the state helped to create circumstances in which <span class="highlight">families</span> could prosper and be protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In matters which affect the wellbeing of the state- the collection of <span class="highlight">families</span>- majority views may need to be enforced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In laws governing <span class="highlight">families</span> as single units the historic principle should be maintained and the state should interfere as little as possible with the freedom of action and responsibility within the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thus, agricultural societies usually have large <span class="highlight">families</span> providing social security and sharing in production and consumption in a subsistence economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thus the size, structure, economic circumstances and attitudes of members of <span class="highlight">families</span> have changed greatly with industrialisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Once the accepted Christian principles of the family are eroded the end result must eventually be a lack of respect for the traditions of marriage with the resultant growth of fragmented and broken <span class="highlight">families</span> and a consequent lack of parental control and a possible increase in anti-social behaviour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we are to maintain stability in our <span class="highlight">families</span>- the framework of our nation- it is absolutely essential that divorce be granted only after a searching inquiry based on time honoured and acccepted grounds such as adultery, cruelty, desertion, and true separation and incompatibility over a reasonable period of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Change in the economic status of the family in the modern urban society is also creating increasing stresses on relationships within marriage and without and this again is an area in which we need to adjust our approach to and our thinking on that marriage relationship- the fundamental cornerstone of <span class="highlight">families</span> in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Housing Corporation proposed in this BUI permits us to explore a fresh field of endeavour, that of direct relations between government and private enterprise, and between government and non-profit organisations, in the housing of the large number of ordinary Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That scheme, effective as it has proved, concentrated on one area of action- State enterprise in the housing of the poorer <span class="highlight">families</span> in our Australian population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, so far as it can within its resources, the Corporation will make housing loans available to <span class="highlight">families</span>, using the family allowance provisions in the Austraiian Constitution, and it will also make loans to those other specific categories of home-seekers for whom the Australian Government has a constitutional responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the achievements of the Commonwealth Railways would not have been possible without the dedication of its staff who, with their <span class="highlight">families</span>, are required to live in some of the remotest parts of Australia and under some of the harshest climatic conditions this continent has to offer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am attracted to the proposition that the family allowances power in the constitution will be utilised in order to help certain <span class="highlight">families</span> and certain classes of <span class="highlight">families</span> who presently are not eligilbe to obtain the finance that is available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Corporation could be directed to lend to <span class="highlight">families</span> who did not meet the eligibility conditions set out in the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, but who could not meet the repayment burden imposed by the much higher interest rates charged by permanent building societies and banks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is all very well for the Governments of New South Wales and Victoria to say that they want to encourage home ownership, but this does not justify their harsh, in fact punitive, attitude to those <span class="highlight">families</span> who cannot, or for various reasons do not wish to, buy their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There could be many mechanisms involved in the process over the last half century which has led to the egalitarian distribution of wealth I have mentioned, and in particular by which today some 99 per cent of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> have increased their share of the nation’s private wealth from 61 per cent to 91 per cent- a very high proportion indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The matter on which I wish to speak tonight is one of concern to 9 members of the Commonwealth Police in Bendigo and, of course, their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These men have raised their <span class="highlight">families</span> in Bendigo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can only hope that the Minister will take urgent steps to protect the 9 <span class="highlight">families</span> who are concerned in Bendigo and also will take necessary action to ensure proper protection and security for the 2 undertakings concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This may be the case in some professional <span class="highlight">families</span>, but in the majority of working <span class="highlight">families</span> where the wife has no professional qualifications it would impose severe hardship upon her and, if there are some children- in most cases they wish to remain with their mother-it would also impose severe harship on these children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legislation should do what it can to positively support the family and it should, in seeking to be compassionate and just to those leaving the marriage, be very careful of the needs of all <span class="highlight">families</span> and of other members of that family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather than undermine <span class="highlight">families</span> and marriage, the Bill strengthens them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me it is a tragic matter that Parliament should be asked to approve this Bill which must deal a devastating blow to our <span class="highlight">families</span> and which places marriage on the basis of a yearly contract, because that is what the Bill does in clauses 48 and 49. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would think that this would have been a monumental piece of legislation to strengthen and protect <span class="highlight">families</span>, not for the easy, speedy, quickie divorce for which the legislation before this House at present provides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only hope that, if the contingent motion proposed by the Minister for Tourism and Recreation is carried, the Bill will be redrafted in a sense that it will strengthen homes, strengthen <span class="highlight">families</span>, protect women, protect children and help to advance this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘If one could abuse the privilege of confidentiality and read some of the letters people have written to me on this matter setting out the details of the divorce or the break-up of their own <span class="highlight">families</span>, I think we would all look at this Bill in a new light. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Families</span> regulate such intimate and personal matters, and so many of their rules are vague understandings arrived at by experiment and mutual adjustment, but there seems to be an especially strong case for leaving them alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legal rules, for instance, governing the property rights of husband and wife are quite irrelevant in <span class="highlight">families</span> where all property has always been pooled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I instanced was the fact that under section 51 ofthe Constitution, placitum (XXIIIa) there is a power to make allowances for <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We want to make it clear that the Housing Corporation can provide rental subsidies direct to <span class="highlight">families</span>, on the one hand, or indeed to do in Australia what is done in other parts of the world, that is, to assist even the entrepreneurs because the fact is that this sort of thing is done in Canada, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and in Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can shilly shally around as much as it likes on this legislation but if it rejects it the Opposition wil take away the prospect of supporting <span class="highlight">families</span> whose income is such that they are unable to afford adequate rental housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At least 25 per cent of <span class="highlight">families</span> had no medical insurance although only one family answered that they used the subsidised medical service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nothing can overcome the problems of <span class="highlight">families</span> when children come home from school and say: ‘Why is my father not at work today? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite unfair and ridiculous to suggest that people should make a sacrifice that would affect their <span class="highlight">families</span> or their future simply because of the old concept that people who are elected to Parliament need not be paid anything at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reversion to the old system would mean that those <span class="highlight">families</span> who, at very great sacrifice, have got their children through the fifth and sixth forms on very low incomesthis would involve some 14 000 children at present- would lose vital assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill is being denounced as a conspiracy to wreck marriages, break up <span class="highlight">families</span>, spread immorality, tear the social fabric and destroy the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As the vote is on a personal and individual basis I put it to honourable members that they have a great responsibility for the future happiness and security of large numbers of people and <span class="highlight">families</span> who can only benefit if the Family Law Bill is carried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, since I have been a member of this place I have seen the breaking up of many <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think too that most people would also agree that it is inevitable that some marriages will break down, that <span class="highlight">families</span> will be placed under stress, and that human failings, bad judgments, community pressures and all sorts of other influences will place many people in situations which they can no longer tolerate, which they should not be expected to tolerate, and which are bad for them, for their children and for society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The loss to the <span class="highlight">families</span> of the 500 people who are now unemployed is a bad one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this matter, the sole role of the Australian Government was to bring eligible children to suitable adoptive <span class="highlight">families</span> as promptly and as safely as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As soon as the Australian Government received advice that the first requirement had been met and that, on the second, the States had approved 246 adopting <span class="highlight">families</span>, arrangements were made to bring the orphans by Hercules transport to Bangkok and by chartered Qantas jet to Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Faced with this fact, my Government determined that it could do nothing in the matter of allocating children to <span class="highlight">families</span> as this was clearly a State responsibility and therefore if there was to be any disagreement between adoptive <span class="highlight">families</span> about the children then it was a matter for the States to determine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at legislation which will affect <span class="highlight">families</span> and family life and which will have an effect on children, the relationship between parents and the interdependence of one individual on another if a relationship is to continue no longer, I believe that there must be- and it is very difficult to escape from- a situation where fault is taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Marriage is the very basis of the family and it has been the motivation of the bread winners in the <span class="highlight">families</span> which has kept our society as we know it today going. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the end it comes down to the point that the people on the Aboriginal councils are able to discriminate against <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore we are considering a fundamental question of the freedom of movement of people and the right of reunion of <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These amendments are put forward as perhaps not the perfect answer to the problem but certainly to recognise the fact that the nonAboriginal administration should not be able to to take away from the Aboriginal people who have been born on these reserves, who have lived there and whose <span class="highlight">families</span> have lived there, the right of entry or otherwise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said before, self determination for communities does not include an absolute right over freedom of movement and the reunion of <span class="highlight">families</span> that is implied in the present situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In moving to establish the Children’s Commission the Australian Government has recognised that changing social patterns have put considerable pressures on <span class="highlight">families</span> with infant and school-age children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These changes include a growing number of <span class="highlight">families</span> where both parents work, and of single parent <span class="highlight">families</span>, as well as a frequently increasing sense of isolation affecting women looking after children at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Priority will also be given to <span class="highlight">families</span> in economic or other distress, and to groups with particular needs such as Aborigines, migrants, handicapped children and isolated children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole object of the personal income tax cuts, of our support for wage indexation and the substantial improvements we have achieved in the provision of health, education, public transport and community services has been to sustain and raise the real standard of living of <span class="highlight">families</span> beyond that provided by the pay packet alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view the establishment of a commission with the purposes set out in this Bill will not enable the Commission to do what many like the New South Wales Federation of Infant School Clubs think it should do, namely ‘establish a philosophy in relation to ultimate goals incorporating standards, innovations, needs and priorities in relation to <span class="highlight">families</span>’- and I emphasise ‘<span class="highlight">families</span>’- ‘and the community’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> either choose to care for their pre-school age children especially those of 3 years of age and under, or would like to be able to make that choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Governments, and the community itself, must take positive action to counteract some of the economic and social pressures affecting <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must endorse the trend to family orientation of child care by strengthening the capabilities of <span class="highlight">families</span> with measures designed to improve their social and economic conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such matters as taxation policies originally designed for a nation of single income <span class="highlight">families</span> or taxation concessions and child endowment and other benefits which have lost their real value are matters that are in need of urgent attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Growing numbers of <span class="highlight">families</span> find themselves unable to reconcile the financial difference between the childless, 2 -income situation of early married life with the single income family role that comes with parenthood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much legislation discriminates against the normal 2-parent family and, in addition, places 2 -income <span class="highlight">families</span> in an advantaged position when compared with those <span class="highlight">families</span> where the wife and mother stays at home to care for her children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">families</span> are to be given the opportunity of providing adequate home based care for their young children, measures with both direct and indirect consequences must be introduced to ensure that a real choice is available where today no real choice exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the most significant way in which support could be given to individual <span class="highlight">families</span> to overcome the financial difficulties that now face them when the mother chooses to provide full-time home based care is to change those laws and practices which now discriminate against <span class="highlight">families</span> which make this choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to continue to have working <span class="highlight">families</span> and if we are to encourage working parents to raise <span class="highlight">families</span>, then governments must make provision for the care of these children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that in my electorate there is a need for someone to check hospital admissions of mothers in order to see what can be done for their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is obviously a trend towards 2-income <span class="highlight">families</span> and we are all aware of the reasons for this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The progress of a people- naturally, I refer to the progress of the Australian people- is very intimately connected with the progress of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> and the progress of the children in those <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But so far I have not heard the Government say, as a government needs to say, what its philosophy is concerning Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> and what is its philosophy concerning the role of mothers in the Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the Minister who said that Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> would be protected from unemployment, yet during his term of office more <span class="highlight">families</span> have suffered the hardships of unemployment than in any period since the great depression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During that time it was my aim to look at the total philosophy of the Government in relation to this Bill and its philosophy towards <span class="highlight">families</span> in the community which is being exemplified in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously that meant it was the Government’s deal with respect to the <span class="highlight">families</span> of Australia which are raising children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interim committee to set up the Commission must establish a philosophy in relation to ultimate goals incorporating standards innovations needs and priorities in relation to <span class="highlight">families</span> and the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ultimately, when a government intrudes into intimate institutions such as the family and when it intrudes into the responsibilities of <span class="highlight">families</span> with respect to children, the power of that government will play a very great role in determining ultimately the values of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned at the transfer from home to community of services organised through this Bill and through other measures of assistance to <span class="highlight">families</span> that have existed in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that $75m an addition of resources available to children in the community and to the <span class="highlight">families</span> caring for children in the community? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only part of a subtraction from the resources available to <span class="highlight">families</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the one measure of assistance that has not risen with inflation but has been kept absolutely constant are the <span class="highlight">families</span> assistance programs, all of which are nominated in the national accounts for mothers’ maternity allowances, bonuses, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One must take into consideration the amount involved in lost taxation deductions for the education of children which, for many <span class="highlight">families</span>, represents an extra cost of $2 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all of this, through the power of the purse, the power of an interventionist government, there is a decreasing of the ability of <span class="highlight">families</span> to make their own decisions concerning their own children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I deny the proposition which seems to be ignored in the Bill that poor <span class="highlight">families</span> somehow or other do not reside in those communities where there are -2 parents, only one of which is working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the poorest <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia are <span class="highlight">families</span> where there are 2 parents and only one of them is working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frankly, that is a philosophy with respect to <span class="highlight">families</span> which I do not support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously rigid controls and frequent checks on <span class="highlight">families</span> who conduct these family unit care centres will be required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Returning to the question of child care being paid for by the Government- that is, if the Government pays for the care of children of working parents- that amounts to a redistribution of income away from single income <span class="highlight">families</span> towards 2-income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might well be asked: Why should a family with one breadwinner have to pay for the care of children of <span class="highlight">families</span> who have 2 breadwinners? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether one agrees with the principle of women in the work force or not, the fact is that many <span class="highlight">families</span> with modest incomes forgo the second pay packet because of a firm belief that being a full time mother is more important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That being so, why should such a family be penalised by having to pay through taxation for the care of children of <span class="highlight">families</span> who are receiving that second pay packet? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a penalty on single income <span class="highlight">families</span> which I do not believe can be justified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned that money has been outlaid already for child care centres but the charges that are being made on the <span class="highlight">families</span> will recover only some of the recurrent costs of the organisations which are running them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It discriminates against <span class="highlight">families</span> which have 2 incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It discriminates against <span class="highlight">families</span> vis-a-vis single people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It discriminates against people with <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a very bad statement, a statement which sounded the death knell for many young Australian couples engaged in a struggle to obtain the necessary funds to bridge the deposit gap to own or build homes in which to bring up their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well over 70 per cent of <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia are buying or own their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has taken over the greater part of the burden of the lower income <span class="highlight">families</span> with a mortgage on their homes by allowing the mortgage interest to be tax deductible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is regretted that when a Labor Government introduces measures such as this that give greater assistance to low income <span class="highlight">families</span> we hear the cry of the Opposition that it is socialism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say it should be questioned because it is not the only form of providing adequate long term shelter for individuals and <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since over 70 per cent of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> own or at least are paying off their own home and nearly all Australians aspire to this state, the political advantages of both the Government and the Opposition in helping them out are evident. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Large <span class="highlight">families</span> who had difficulty in finding suitable accommodation under $22,500 were excluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By contrast, <span class="highlight">families</span> in real need of assistance with housing may not be able to obtain the benefit of the grant because of their inability to accumulate savings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at the number of people who have been assisted by the homes savings grant scheme on an annual basis- in the vicinity of 40 000 <span class="highlight">families</span>- one can see that here again the benefit is extremely limited compared with the tax deductibility scheme in that close to 1.5 million famines will benefit, not only once but every year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a difference between 40 000 <span class="highlight">families</span> on the one hand, and 1.5 million <span class="highlight">families</span> on the other hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Since its establishment, the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation has assisted 168 000 <span class="highlight">families</span> obtain homes by insuring loans totalling $2,040m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Millions of Australians now rely on the life insurance industry for their long-term security and the welfare of their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The compelling answer is that insurance fulfils a necessary or essential social need; it provides financial protection against unpredictable losses and a means for individuals and <span class="highlight">families</span> to provide for their own long term economic security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is trying to create in those who are in the industry the greatest fear of all- that of unemployment- without regard to the effect it has on the bread winners of the family or the dependants of the <span class="highlight">families</span> employed in the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In foreign affairs language, unilateral declaration of independence is a dirty expression but in the case of <span class="highlight">families</span> a unilateral declaration of independence can be made under this Bill by either spouse whether either or neither of them is guilty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I simply say that I genuinely believe, over a period of time of taking an interest in these matters- I note that persons in the Senate after an exhaustive investigation concluded the same way- that in the majority of circumstances it is the second year of separation which leads to so much bitterness, divisiveness, heartburn and breaking asunder of <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so, will the Minister explain whether the Government has any manpower proposals for the building industry which will marry the wish of workers to find jobs to the wish of <span class="highlight">families</span> to buy houses? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I am concerned to see that <span class="highlight">families</span> are strengthened and that the interests of children are protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recognise that it involves counselling a large number of <span class="highlight">families</span>; but the price involved in providing that counselling for a large number of <span class="highlight">families</span>, if it gives a happy family life in a 2-parent situation for a significant number of children, is worth paying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believed that circumstances- geographical, climatic and personal- were so varied and so different that we had to handle the matter on an ad hoc basis and with enormous sympathy and care for those to whom damage had been done, and those whose livelihoods and <span class="highlight">families</span> might have been affected in a traumatic and difficult way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But that is a most misleading figure because it includes married couples who would draw only one rent allowance and it includes a number of people- a majority of them- who are living with their <span class="highlight">families</span> and do not pay rent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the flexibility within the Act is extremely interesting and will lead to a lot more <span class="highlight">families</span>- particularly <span class="highlight">families</span> of deserted wives and those Aborigines who are not able to move into home ownership- being able to buy a home, which is the dream of most of us, through the Australian Housing Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-From listening to the honourable member for Darling Downs  (Mr McVeigh)  and for that matter to the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Ellicott)  one would believe that aU the problems associated with housing Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> eventuated in the last 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can remember one occasion since I entered this Parliament in 1969, a Minister for Housing in b.e Liberal-Country Party Government, the honourable member for Lilley  (Mr Kevin Cairns),  at one stage being asked about a survey to forecast housing needs of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this Government were sincere in the matter the answer is not to disguise the progress of ever increasing unemployment by stopping the input of people and causing loneliness and despair among individual migrant <span class="highlight">families</span>; the solution needs to be sought elsewhere- in better management and in reasoned policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All too often it is those programs at the fringe which are cut back while the rest of the community goes on upgrading the services that are available to it and the young <span class="highlight">families</span> pay the price of having to live in inadequate accommodation because they are unable to afford to purchase their own home, unable to realise the dream of home ownership? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The entire constitutional upheaval that this country witnessed, the personal bickering between <span class="highlight">families</span> and friends, was simply the result of a greed for power that could not wait 1 8 months for a legitimate election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government is going to give something to everybody all over Australia, if, for example, it is going to provide child care services all over Australia, it will be terribly expensive, but if it can be argued that such things should be provided only in certain geographical areas or to certain disadvantaged <span class="highlight">families</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately the subsidised health benefit plan did not work as it was originally intended, when introducing this scheme in 1970 the then Minister for Health,  Dr A.  J.

    <p>There was an extension in June 1970 to provide for a further 84 000 <span class="highlight">families</span> or over 250 000 individuals to be catered for under the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The final part of my amendment refers to the question of the economy and refers specifically to the fact that middle and low income <span class="highlight">families</span> are going to suffer most under this Government’s administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, the amendment of the honourable member for Scullin stated:  … the proposals outlined in the Speech are so framed as to cause a major transfer of resources from the middle and low income <span class="highlight">families</span> to those on higher income levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people most harmed by the inflationary excessed, by the high unemployment and by the high interest rates that existed over the last 3 years were those very people, the middle and low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is also a novel way of justifying the cutting of deferred mortgage repayment schemes for housing loans for the low income <span class="highlight">families</span> who are already struggling to exercise their independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An Australian Labor Party government by now would have been lending money on more flexible repayment terms to assist <span class="highlight">families</span> in making their housing repayments in accordance with their means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not my intention to dwell on that disaster, but I should like in my maiden speech to extend my sympathy to the <span class="highlight">families</span> who lost their loved ones and to pay a tribute to the many people who worked so genuinely and so hard during those months in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know of <span class="highlight">families</span> who are very well off and still claim these special allowances simply because they have some small amount of Aboriginal blood in the family, even though they own large properties or have high incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Fraser Government, on coming to office, tackled the fundamental problems facing the Australian community, namely, to bring order where chaos now exists in the economy, to provide an economic climate where people can find employment, and to provide an economic climate where the stresses on the <span class="highlight">families</span> of the nation are reduced so that mothers who wish to care for their children at home are able to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So much of its legislation put on the family pressures that created a need for child care services where <span class="highlight">families</span> were previously able to provide and wished still to provide those services for their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was the Opposition when in government that destroyed the aspirations of <span class="highlight">families</span> and those children who need child care, by creating a huge pool of unemployed in the country and by fanning the fires of inflation so that the value of the services that a government could provide out of the Budget resources available in real terms did less for the community than those resources should have achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The inequalities in our community now reflect not so much gross disparities in income but the failure of successive Liberal governments to create opportunities for the overwhelming majority of our people- the lower, the modest and the middle-income <span class="highlight">families</span>- opportunities which only governments can make and increasingly in Australia the national Government must initiate those opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition claims that the Government is transferring resources from middle and low income <span class="highlight">families</span> to those on higher incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As all honourable members probably know the social security beneficiary- the widow, the would be breadwinner who is an invalid, the unemployed and the sick- who have dependants in their <span class="highlight">families</span> are worst off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The elitism and reactionary style of this Government cannot be better evidenced than by the fact that- and I quote from the amendment- ‘the proposals outlined in the Speech are so framed as to cause a major transfer of resources from middle and low income <span class="highlight">families</span> to those on higher income levels’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the proposals outlined in the Speech are so framed as to cause the major transfer of resources from middle and low income <span class="highlight">families</span> to those on higher income levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It refers to the economic situation and the major transfer of resources from low income <span class="highlight">families</span> to those on high incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I could easily continue to enumerate the instances where this Government has clearly demonstrated its intention of transferring resources from the middle and low income <span class="highlight">families</span> to those on higher incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remainder, by necessity, battle on in an effort to achieve an after tax income which enables them to support their <span class="highlight">families</span> and complete the purchase of a home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many inequalities in society essentially reflect differences between <span class="highlight">families</span> rather than between individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is done in the United Kingdom but there most <span class="highlight">families</span> pay less tax than they would had the spouses been taxed separately because the rebates available to those taxed separately on the family unit are not otherwise available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are over 90 000 <span class="highlight">families</span> already buying their own homes with loans from these societies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many young <span class="highlight">families</span> will be slugged for another $4 or $5 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such people are accumulating wealth; but they also have pride- a pride in their own person, a pride in their <span class="highlight">families</span>, a pride in their own homes which flows on to a pride in their community and nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Queensland Government has seen fit to try to alleviate the situation by providing some funds out of its own Budget, but the backlog at the moment is something like 6500 <span class="highlight">families</span> with applications before the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In this way, with the same amount of money, if houses can be constructed more economically by the use of new techniques, more dwellings can be constructed, more <span class="highlight">families</span> can be accommodated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that way <span class="highlight">families</span> can be housed in a much shorter time, and the people can have a house perhaps at a lower cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During those 3 years too many Australians, too many Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> in too many areas, had insurmountable problems of access to housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The frustration of many Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> in not being able to obtain housing was contributed to by an unsympathetic Labor Government which was unable to control interest rates and to provide encouragement to the private sector to build houses in all areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This figure represents <span class="highlight">families</span> with no permanent home because of the strategies and policies of the Australia Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the southern area of Tasmania there are 2178 <span class="highlight">families</span> waiting for homes; in the northern area there are 837; in the northwestern area there are 751; and King Island, Flinders Island and other isolated communities take up the balance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that the other 2080 <span class="highlight">families</span> who are waiting have not yet got around to contacting their new member or perhaps they have contacted somebody else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where does one bring into account the costs borne by students and <span class="highlight">families</span>, including the income forgone during a period of study to gain employment later at a higher level and, presumably, with higher remuneration, and the cost of educational subsidies both direct and indirect? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet only a short time after that remarkable statement, farmers have been walking off their properties to find work in the dues as labourers, unskilled factory workers, and to work at any job they can get to support their <span class="highlight">families</span> and to help to maintain and service the debts that have been built up on their farms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In some quarters it has been suggested that the decline in fertility since 1971 is a temporary phenomenon due largely to a recent marked change in attitudes towards starting <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While there is some evidence of deferment of first births in some <span class="highlight">families</span>, this in itself seems to have been only a minor factor in the severe fall in fertility since 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposals outlined in the Speech are so framed as to cause a major transfer of resources from middle and low income <span class="highlight">families</span> to those on higher income levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They now know that the proposals outlined in the Governor-General’s Speech are so framed as to cause a major transfer of resources from the middle and low income <span class="highlight">families</span> to those on higher income levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These were not the pleas of so-called bloated capitalists but the cries of people who wanted to be left to themselves to strive and achieve, to be given the right to express themselves, to enjoy their <span class="highlight">families</span> and not to be told: ‘Give me your earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might add that, after surviving many years on pocket money, which in most <span class="highlight">families</span> did not amount to much, the unemployment benefit was an extremely attractive and generous gift. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that pension on a long term basis to be merely related to the consumer price index will not ensure that those pensioner <span class="highlight">families</span>, whether they be the aged or the widows with dependent children, share adequately and equitably in the growing wealth of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, the changing pattern of single income and two-income <span class="highlight">families</span> in themselves must throw into some doubt the adequacy in the future- in 10, 15 or 20 years time- of merely adjusting pensions against the income of one of a two-income family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the honourable member for Stun pointed out, there are many <span class="highlight">families</span> in the community that are receiving 2 incomes and the person relying on benefits is likely to be receiving 1 income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is hedged about with unreasonable means test provisions and I do not think it has really operated as it should have done to the benefit of pensioners’ <span class="highlight">families</span> because of its relationship to what I would call the funeral industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not known how long all these children will be in the area; it is likely that <span class="highlight">families</span> will be moving away from the hostel to other parts of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Entry to home ownership is quickly becoming restricted to three types of <span class="highlight">families</span>- those who inherit money, the top 30 per cent of income earners and <span class="highlight">families</span> with 2 incomes who are acceptable to the lending institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Migrants who come to this country from overseas and who bring with them their life savings to invest in the new country in which they will be dwelling, raising their <span class="highlight">families</span> and contributing so well to our community, will have those life savings considered as part of this program and gain additional finance to establish their home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is applicable to all sections of our society, from the young family to the older <span class="highlight">families</span>, from single people to married people, and it is applicable to all permanent residents in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 hope that it will give hope eternal to the 6490 <span class="highlight">families</span> in Queensland who at present are homeless and are at present unable to obtain homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We decided to substitute the home savings grant scheme for tax deductibility allowances which involved an expenditure of $ 130m and was likely to assist about 1  Vi  million <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we have this new situation which will disadvantage many many thousands of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> because the scheme is now to be limited to people who are making repayments in respect of their first home and only during the first 5 years of those repayments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To return to the handout mentality of road funding is to court disaster for thousands of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me that the people who have come to this country as migrants have settled in an area of work in which, unless we do something about lifting their potential in the workforce, they are destined to remain, like a lot of the children who come from Greek <span class="highlight">families</span> in my own electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have been concerned not to add unnecessarily to the distress of the immediate <span class="highlight">families</span> of the newsmen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be disturbed indeed if I thought that any of my Ministers held shares in companies in those circumstances or if they had adopted the device of transferring them to their wives or dependent members of their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the predominance of people- people rearing young <span class="highlight">families</span> and incurring family costs- are going to lose the benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman would well know that because of the increased proportion of money that has been saved in recent times there is a great capacity amongst individuals and <span class="highlight">families</span> of Australia to make such purchases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I would have thought it was quite plain from the experience of the last two or three years that merely adding to money wages and leaving ills in the economy, as has been the case, will not do anything for the recovery of the economy in a way which will assist individuals and <span class="highlight">families</span> all around Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course the sad reality is that many growers and their <span class="highlight">families</span> will suffer subsistence levels of income and be forced off their places before this rationalisation comes about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think it is without question that subsidies often encourage people to stay on the land when they and their <span class="highlight">families</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am saying that subsidies encourage people to stay on the land when they and their <span class="highlight">families</span> would be much better off making the break and setting up in another field of endeavour which would give them a more acceptable standard of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is just a matter of an individual making a choice for himself, it is not so questionable; but, when young <span class="highlight">families</span>, wives and mothers are concerned, they are deprived of normally accepted amenities which other people often enjoy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Quite frequently their only regret is that they did not make the decision much sooner and that they delayed the decision for far too long, to the detriment of the welfare of their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Farmers and their <span class="highlight">families</span> are suffering badly, and not even the most blinkered city dweller can dismiss this as the ‘cockies whingeing again ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the factors that may not be known to the community is the tremendous effort that has been made by the wives and <span class="highlight">families</span> of fruit growers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The wives and <span class="highlight">families</span> of fruit growers have stood by them, particularly in the picking season, to enable the farms to continue to operate for the time being at least. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many wives have worked in the industry for years so that their menfolk and <span class="highlight">families</span> might be able to carry on into a period of greater prosperity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the wives and <span class="highlight">families</span> are not compelled to assist the fruit growers to the extent that they do; but this has been the spirit with which fruit growing has been conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That means people from my area have to go to Melbourne, which I think it is a most unfortunate social depredation for those people and for their <span class="highlight">families</span>  and the communities that they leave behind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we are to discourage people from going to nursing homes unless they really need to do so- if their <span class="highlight">families</span> and outside support services can help them- we should be looking at increasing the domiciliary nursing care benefit in line with the rate of inflation, we should be providing as much help as possible for these people in the way of community services, such as district nursing services, and perhaps we should be extending the flexibility of the domiciliary nursing care scheme not only to allow for a change in the ratio of registered nurses to nursing aides but also in relation to the requirement of a medical assessment for the domiciliary nursing scheme as distinct from the medical assessment that is required for the aged at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How do honourable members opposite reconcile that with the sort of stuff the Government is going to put over tonight about giving with one hand purportedly to the poorer <span class="highlight">families</span> in the community and taking away from the same group in another way, that is, by the imposition of a levy on Medibank that is probably going to be something of the order of $ 1, 000m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>More than one million <span class="highlight">families</span> are at present benefiting as a result of this provision which I understand is incurring or involving expenditure in excess of $120m a year <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I have said, one million <span class="highlight">families</span> have been benefiting to a very considerable extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is more intent on giving money to wealthy people rather than continuing this benefit which has provided assistance to one million <span class="highlight">families</span> or more throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would mention here, however, that the Government’s proposed new arrangements for assistance to <span class="highlight">families</span> will be of particular benefit to Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Consideration is being given to changes in the program designed to ensure greater emphasis on child care to children of needy <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Assistance  to  <span class="highlight">Families</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is also proposing a major reform of present arrangements for assistance to <span class="highlight">families</span>, so as to direct much more support to those <span class="highlight">families</span> in real need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These arrangements discriminate against <span class="highlight">families</span> in which the income of the main or sole income earner falls short of the minimum taxation threshold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such <span class="highlight">families</span> are unable to take advantage of the taxation rebates for children which are available to the great majority of <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A system under which low-income <span class="highlight">families</span> are denied the main form of assistance to <span class="highlight">families</span> is clearly a matter of very great inequity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The broad effect of these changes will be to increase the weekly level of child endowment paid to <span class="highlight">families</span> by between $3 and $4 per child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the weekly equivalent of the present maximum taxation rebate is $3.85 in respect of most children, the overall position of <span class="highlight">families</span> able to take full advantage of these rebates at present will not be greatly changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are, however, about 800 000 children in low income <span class="highlight">families</span> which pay little or no taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new system will provide greatly increased assistance to 300 000 such <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another effect of the new system will be to bring about some redistribution of income within <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be payable by Australian residents who do not have appropriate cover for themselves and their <span class="highlight">families</span> with a registered private insurance fund, or through payment of a premium to Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposals outlined arise from a review til” the manner in which assistance for <span class="highlight">families</span> is now available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most <span class="highlight">families</span> receive assistance for children under 16 years of age and students by way of child endowment and personal incometax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the benefits that arc available to some taxpayers by way of tax rebates for children do not apply to some 300 000 <span class="highlight">families</span> whose incomes are insufficient to enable them to take advantage of those tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government regards it as of first importance that these <span class="highlight">families</span> who, as a class, are those most in need, should receive the additional financial help which this Bill will provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increases in the sole parent rebate and the rebate for a dependent spouse will be of benefit to all single income <span class="highlight">families</span> which are subject to taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For such <span class="highlight">families</span> they will more than offset any reduction in assistance for children arising from the substitution of increased family allowances for personal income tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Too many members of the work force of this country, unfortunately for the honourable member, are now appreciating the absolute folly of wage increases which to them and their <span class="highlight">families</span> have become illusory as the process of inflation induced by the honourable member and his colleagues has continued unchecked in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it will greatly assist <span class="highlight">families</span>, particularly those in the poorer financial brackets, and as I think I said in the statement, it will directly have a very advantageous impact upon the 300 000 poor <span class="highlight">families</span> with some 800 000 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The withdrawal of hospital subsidies, the destruction of Medibank, the drastic increases decreed in public hospital charges for intermediate and private wards will put the best medical care beyond the reach of even moderately well-to-do <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were told by the Treasurer that more than 300 000 <span class="highlight">families</span> and 800 000 people will benefit from that measure alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some relief is provided to the suffering of the poorest <span class="highlight">families</span> in our community, particularly by a measure directed at the children of poor <span class="highlight">families</span> and is deserving of support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only trouble is that the rest of the package combined with this Government’s policies for the reduction of real wages and the maintenance of high levels of unemployment in order to temper wage claims will guarantee that more and more <span class="highlight">families</span> and more single people, both old and young, will be sucked down below the poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has become increasingly obvious that the system of taxation rebates was of little benefit to <span class="highlight">families</span> whose taxation was either at a very low level or even non-existent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increase in child endowment and the abolition of the tax rebates for children mean that <span class="highlight">families</span> will have less cash in their pay envelopes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, in the announcement of its final decisions it ensured that special considerations will be given to the future of the problems of low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and the needy to provide justice to the individual taxpayers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Shortly before question time the Minister for Health and other people were in my office looking at a draft of a simplified document which will enable people throughout Australiawhether they be single people, married people with one income between the two, or 2-income <span class="highlight">families</span>- to determine the choices available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will allow them therefore to make the proper choice depending on whether they want universally available health care under Medibank, which will provide for all people in Australia the cheapest form of health cover of a good and high standard- both medical and hospital cover- or wish to make a decision which would enable them, for themselves as single people or for their <span class="highlight">families</span>, to take out some additional insurance to enable them to be treated in hospital by their own doctor in either an intermediate or private ward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The benefits for those 200 000 or 300 000 poor <span class="highlight">families</span> of which the Treasurer spoke will tend to erode year by year after the first year and will provide little alleviation of the problems of those in need, because of the inroads of inflation solely because these benefits are not indexed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst this is welcome for that reason alone it is especially welcome because there are many primary producer <span class="highlight">families</span> today which have little or no income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The very serious depression in the cattle and dairy industries in particular, and in some other rural industries as well, has resulted in many farm <span class="highlight">families</span> receiving a very minimum income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the basic change now to be made with the introduction of family allowances at a much higher rate than the previous child endowment will prove to be of major assistance to many of these low income farm <span class="highlight">families</span> about which I have spoken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, it was under the Labor Government that the number of permanent residents entering the country to join <span class="highlight">families</span> steadily increased as a proportion of the total migrant intake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least the presence of members of their <span class="highlight">families</span> who have already settled here will soften the blow of these cuts that I have mentioned, cuts that have destroyed most of the support systems available to our new arrivals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many cases, particularly when both parents are deceased, where the people involved wish to join their brothers or sisters in this country to reunite what is left of their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further most disturbing aspect of this inquiry was that it revealed that there were 250 000 dependent children in very poor <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this context it is of great significance, in relation to the Government’s decision to use the vehicle of family allowance to direct resources away from the relatively well off to the poor, that the report showed quite clearly that the group of people in the community whose incomes fall below the poverty line by the biggest percentage were in large <span class="highlight">families</span> whose fathers were earning the minimum wage or a little more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, one of the most disturbing aspects of the situation was that there were a quarter of a million dependent children in very poor <span class="highlight">families</span>, many of them in 2 -parent <span class="highlight">families</span> with the father in full employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We therefore recommend that substantial increases be made in rates of child endowment and that taxation allowances for children be replaced by tax credits which should be added to child endowment to help poorer <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In further support of these proposals I also mention that the Government has paid particular attention to the needs of <span class="highlight">families</span> with only one breadwinner, especially sole parent <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a group, sole parent <span class="highlight">families</span> constitute a large <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proportion of the 300 000 <span class="highlight">families</span> and their 00 000 children who do not receive the full benefit of the existing rebates for children and students and accordingly who will be among the principal beneficiaries of these measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has recognised that the previous system of taxation rebates for dependent children benefited those in the high tax brackets and did little for the really poor <span class="highlight">families</span>, particularly those who did not pay any income tax at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government regards it as imperative that the poor <span class="highlight">families</span> who did not benefit much if at all from the rebate system should receive the additional financial help which this Bill will provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have always felt that this was an abuse of scarce government resources, particularly when there were many poor <span class="highlight">families</span> who needed much more in the way of family allowances to provide better food, clothing and other basic or essential items for their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although child endowment is not means tested, the impact of the combined measures- that is, the increases in endowment payments and the abolition of tax rebates for children- has a similar effect to that of a means test and quite properly will ensure that resources will be directed away from the relatively well off <span class="highlight">families</span> and into the hands of the poorer <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have alluded already to the fact that by redistributing the benefits of family allowances to the poorer <span class="highlight">families</span> this money will be spent on more essential items for the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conversely, because of this redistribution, if wealthier <span class="highlight">families</span> wish to purchase less essential and more luxury items for their children, obviously more of this kind of expenditure will have to come from their own resources and less from the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further advantage of the new system is that <span class="highlight">families</span> will not have to wait until the end of the financial year to receive the benefits of family allowances, as occurred under the tax rebate system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To those who suggest that it is wrong for the Government to subsidise those who have children and to penalise those who do not, I simply say that in the aggregate there has not been any significant increase in government resources directed to helping <span class="highlight">families</span> who have children, whether these resources be measured in the form of direct expenditure via child endowment payments or in the form of a loss to revenue through tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The total amount has simply been redistributed to poorer <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other criticisms I have heard- I repeat them- are that this scheme is an incentive to have more children and that in particular it gives encouragement to certain irresponsible people who have large <span class="highlight">families</span> but cannot afford them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the people who make these kinds of criticisms about poor people and large <span class="highlight">families</span>, I say that it is morally questionable to suggest that the capacity or incentive to have children should be judged solely by pecuniary considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our migrant <span class="highlight">families</span> are a particular group in the community who will benefit very substantially from the introduction of the family allowances proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those <span class="highlight">families</span> where there are a large number of children- these are normally the poorest people in the community, particularly the non-British migrant <span class="highlight">families</span>- the allowance will provide substantial regular income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The changes that have been made in the means of distributing funds in this area are to the advantage of the large <span class="highlight">families</span> on low incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The money that is to be paid in child endowment to a substantial number of <span class="highlight">families</span> but not all <span class="highlight">families</span> will be more than offset by the losses of expendable income in areas in which people have greater reserves and are more likely to spend that income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many people banked the tax concessions that have now been taken away by not claiming them at the time but leaving them with the Taxation Office to draw at the time that they submitted their taxation returns, which happened to be a very convenient time for most <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Subject to the grace of the Commissioner of Taxation, the taxation refund usually arrived in October, November or, at the latest, early December- immediately prior to Christmas and just prior to the period of greatest expenditure for most <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The new scheme of family allowances which benefits those worst off <span class="highlight">families</span> the most is a major advance in social welfare in Australia and is recognised as such by all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>I refer to statements that have been made to the effect that the family allowance proposals will benefit the 300 000 <span class="highlight">families</span> and their 800 000 children throughout Australia who could not take advantage of the previous system of tax deductions for dependants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I started by speaking about Medibank; but I want, in passing, to make one point on another matter; that is- I will not deal with it for any great length of time- the tax tables and the prose and cons of the benefit figures which were published last week by the Taxation Office on the situations of <span class="highlight">families</span> with different compositions and different incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me quote from the section of the report entitled ‘Measures to Assist <span class="highlight">Families</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The most urgent need of poor <span class="highlight">families</span> is for income support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More money will alleviate the stress on these <span class="highlight">families</span>, provide greater security, and increase the <span class="highlight">families</span>’ choices in the way they organise their lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have seen that poverty among 2-parent <span class="highlight">families</span> is related to family size . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The- earnings of heads of large <span class="highlight">families</span> are, in fact, very similar to those of heads of small <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an immediate measure, therefore, the Commission would concentrate help to <span class="highlight">families</span> through child endowment and abolish taxation deductions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These measures will help 300 000 low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and their 800 000 children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Special Study of the Medical Care Program for Steelworkers and their <span class="highlight">Families</span>, a study encompassing over 1 million steelworkers, ‘corroborated the United Mineworkers of America findings by revealing that the 38 879 who obtained their health care through a prepaid, direct service, comprehensive group practice plan, where doctors were on salary, had similar experiences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Families</span> on higher incomes can, if they so wish, obtain the type of services that the honourable member for Maribyrnong mentioned- the services available in our great public hospitals- and can take out, in approximate terms, a $300 family premium or package that will cover them for the cost of treatment in standard wards of public hospitals with hospital staff engaged by the hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, if there were not that sort of arrangement whereby people or <span class="highlight">families</span> on the $13,000 to $ 14,000 income level could opt out of Medibank, people earning $40,000 a year would be paying enormous amounts, far beyond what would be judged to be fair, to remain in Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While there is a continuation of these programs and commitments in the forthcoming year, what we would want to do is to see that a greater part of Commonwealth funds goes to providing genuine child care for those in need- for single parent <span class="highlight">families</span> who wish to be independent; who want to work and cannot work because they cannot get adequate child care facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Entry to home ownership is quickly becoming restricted to 3 types of <span class="highlight">families</span>- those who inherit money from their parents, the top 20 per cent of income earners or <span class="highlight">families</span> with 2 incomes acceptable to lending institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that an analysis of those speeches of members of the Opposition will make known to the Australian people the undeniable fact that the Opposition is pledged not to allow Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> and their children to own their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That this House expresses its deep regret at the deaths of Thomas Louis Bull, O.B.E., a former senator for the State of New South Wales; William Edward Aylett, a former senator for the State of Tasmania; George Irvine Whiteside, a former senator for the State of Queensland; and  Mr Laurence  John Failes, a former member of this House for the electorate of Lawson; places on record its appreciation of their long and meritorious public service; and tenders its profound sympathy to their <span class="highlight">families</span> in their bereavement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760817_reps_30_hor100/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In offering our condolences to the <span class="highlight">families</span> of these former members of this Parliament, I think it is worth remembering those responsibilities, the way they are borne and, of course, the loneliness of frequent separation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760817_reps_30_hor100/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was obvious that <span class="highlight">families</span> above $ 10,000 a year that wanted this extra insurance would be driven out of Medibank by the size of the levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only action taken by the Government was to give a subsidy estimated to cost $ 15m to keep the cost of premiums for shared room intermediate ward hospital accommodation within the reach of low and medium income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many <span class="highlight">families</span> did that because they wanted to be treated by their own doctor in hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the last few years the wages factor has resulted in a big downturn in the service that has been provided to the visitors to that pan of the world, so much so that it has become completely a family concern, with <span class="highlight">families</span> running these individual organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The new system of family allowances, which is helping 300 000 <span class="highlight">families</span> and over 800 000 children, was and is hailed as one of the most far-reaching social reforms in the history of Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will assist large low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, and they will do more for Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span> than the moneys wasted by the Australian Labor Party over the last 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those governments ensure, not only that private enterprise prospers, but that individuals and <span class="highlight">families</span> have a minimum standard of living and social welfare and that the private sector accepts its share of the cost of providing it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the advent of increased education, job expectations in that area have grown but the job opportunities are available only in the capital cities, with the result that there is a buildup of pressure on young people to leave the provincial and country centres, to move into the cities, to leave their <span class="highlight">families</span> and thus to be lost forever to those areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Programs, which were initiated by the previous Government and which have virtually been discontinued by this Government, to provide the amenities of life to people who have been forced into the capital cities and who are rearing <span class="highlight">families</span> in those cities were stop gap measures which at best were unsatisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, it involves funds which go directly to Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span> and gives them an independence and capacity to spend those funds as they believe best in their own interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Two major areas into which a number of these projects have a substantial input are the development of services relating to <span class="highlight">families</span> and social welfare manpower planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In reference to the former, wide ranging research is being conducted on family services in each State and the Territories, to ascertain current and future service needs of <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This has made a very great difference in my electorate, particularly in the beef areas where I know of some large <span class="highlight">families</span> with no income who were finding it increasingly hard even to feed their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under our new policy, some 300 000 low income <span class="highlight">families</span> involving 800 000 children and with income levels that previously derived little or no benefit from rebate schemes will benefit the most. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Finer Report, the report of a community on one-parent <span class="highlight">families</span> in the United Kingdom in July 1974 found that even at the level of disposing of everyday chores and despite the degree of merger between the traditional roles of male and female which has taken place in the last decade, many household tasks still tend to be allocated sexually. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This scandalous decision to subject the settlement income to tax comes as a serious setback for the <span class="highlight">families</span> of these children, who for some 15 years have suffered anxiety and uncertainty in the protracted negotiations and legal actions aimed at securing compensation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>All of this is due not just to the elimination of the taxation rebate for <span class="highlight">families</span>, which has caused hardship for many <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting to find that Meredith Evans, whom I have quoted previously in this House and whose views are basically different from my own, made the point in a recent article that a guaranteed income scheme is designed, amongst other things, to redistribute income vertically towards <span class="highlight">families</span> in poverty and that the introduction of a guaranteed income scheme could lead to many wives in low income households ceasing to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1963, evidence of the living conditions for Theiss Peabody Mitsui mineworkers and their <span class="highlight">families</span> at Moura appalled Judge Gallagher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidence in the case, which followed a strike by the Moura workers, had revealed that workers and their <span class="highlight">families</span> were subjected by the company to conditions which Judge Gallagher described as ‘nauseating, revolting and degrading’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The best way to assist them in most instances is to put money into the hands of the mothers of those <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As my colleague says, in this way poorer <span class="highlight">families</span> including, as the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  stressed recently, Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span>, receive a significant net addition to their incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, about 300 000 low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and their 800 000 dependent children are benefiting in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is more than an indexing of this amount; it has been done in the interests of assisting single income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, so far as real disposable income is concerned, any judgments regarding the effects of the new health service financing arrangements would also need to take into account the introduction from 1 July last of full personal tax indexation and significant improvements in the manner of assisting <span class="highlight">families</span> through family allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The lives that are lost as the result of his Government’s decision to reduce expenditure on safety standards and procedures on the roads and in the air under the smokescreen of re-allocation expenditure will be on his head, and before he, as Minister, makes such decisions he should give some thought to the distress and hardship that he will be creating for thousands of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, reduced take-home paythe impact of the Government’s fiscal measures relating to the introduction of personal tax indexation, the increase in child allowances, the abolition of tax deductions for children and the imposition of the Medibank levy- will have the combined effect of disadvantaging many <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The family allowances program, after allowing for the abolition of the tax rebates for children, will provide a net income gain for low income <span class="highlight">families</span> which have a relatively high propensity to consume, as do pensioners, who with full and automatic indexation are assured of having their incomes increased proportionately by at least as much, and probably more, than the general working population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>4 is due to the loss of tax rebates for children, but this has been more than countered by the increased transfer payment to <span class="highlight">families</span> through the family allowances scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Quite apart from incentives, the wage brackets consisting of incomes of $5,000 to $8,000 are urgently in need of review because <span class="highlight">families</span> in these brackets face a daily battle for survival and can ill afford the inroads taken into this bracket of income by taxes at the rate of 35 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Budget shows, before young <span class="highlight">families</span> and people in need benefited under the generosity of our Government, family allowances were very small and under the inflation that exists today did not do very much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to have been able, through representations and discussions with the Minister for the Capital Territory  (Mr Staley),  to temper this economic necessity with the introduction of a flexible and thoughtful lower interest rate and rental rebate system which ensures that those people and <span class="highlight">families</span> in Canberra needing special consideration are cared for by an understanding administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People higher on the income tax scale will pay according to their taxable incomes, that is, according to their means, unless they choose to pay the Medibank ceiling premium of a maximum of $300 per annum to cover their <span class="highlight">families</span> for full Medibank medical and public ward hospital benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the proposal of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Australian Labor Party, 85 per cent of the <span class="highlight">families</span> which now are insured for hospital-only cover would be worse off and 90 per cent of the single individuals would be worse off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only those <span class="highlight">families</span> which have an income ranging between $8,400 and $9,400 would have been better- and then only marginally better off-by paying the ACTU-ALP levy of 1.6 per cent of their incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of its recommendations was that a national health insurance commission be set up to supervise the funds, to arrange for the insurance funds benefit tables, the basis of payment of medical and hospital fees, special assistance for low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, surveillance of operations of insurance organisations and observance by them of the conditions imposed by and under the National Health Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But a large percentage of young working <span class="highlight">families</span> are expected to pay only the health insurance levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you carry that supposition into the lives of individuals and <span class="highlight">families</span>, the cost of day to day life must decrease and the net benefits to those <span class="highlight">families</span> and individuals conversely increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is, however, in the large silent majority of <span class="highlight">families</span> a strongly held view that the primary care of young children should be given by their mother in a comfortable, secure family setting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The family allowances that have been introduced will relieve to some extent the economic pressure on <span class="highlight">families</span> that up until now have faced increasing difficulty in gaining sufficient resources to enable the mother to be the primary care giver of young children during the preschool years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have said, there are many people in the community who would like to see the young children of this country become the primary responsibility of the State rather than being the primary responsiblity of their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget, containing as it does provision for the necessary funds to enable the new family allowances to continue to be paid, will assist those young <span class="highlight">families</span> to meet the financial commitments involved in caring for young children.In a question I asked the Treasurer about a fortnight ago I urged upon him that when reviewing family allowances he do 2 things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those support services include the provision of a higher family income to enable parents to provide for their <span class="highlight">families</span> the standard of living the community has now come to expect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is possible when the children of a family are at school for the mother to work and she chooses to do so- and over 50 per cent of mothers in the community make that choice- then in those circumstances the family has 2 incomes, but <span class="highlight">families</span> with young children are very often dependent on only one income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an urgent need for careful examination of family incomes to ensure that <span class="highlight">families</span> with young pre-school children have sufficient income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, such <span class="highlight">families</span> need the support of a whole range of childhood services that are not based upon the idea of child care, which in the minds of so many people conjures up the idea of substitute care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They need support, but the type of support that they need is not the type of support that is needed or wanted by the great majority of 2-parent <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The comparative tax take from those <span class="highlight">families</span>, which are equal in all respects, places the single income family at a considerable disadvantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think careful consideration should be given to the possibility of introducing in the case of the family with preschool children an optional income splitting system in the form of some concessional family tax that recognises the need of <span class="highlight">families</span> with young children to have larger resources available to them than the present tax system allows. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is our best hope of not allowing ourselves to fall into a situation such as the one facing us now, in which we have not made a decision upon whether we should have a shipbuilding industry and in which we have a Government which may allow 7000 workers and their <span class="highlight">families</span> to be added to the list of unemployed people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have 120 children enrolled at our Centre at present and we have 200 names on our Waiting List and these people want Sessional Pre-School, not full day care for their children, but they and many thousands more children in the future will be deprived of this, if the Government funding is to cease or decrease, as it will put the fees well and truly out of the reach of the people in our community, as the estimated parent contribution without the Government Grants would be approximately $3-$3.50 per hour, and as you can see, this is a completely unrealistic figure that could not be met by <span class="highlight">families</span>, and here the Government will be affecting the group they most want to help- the needy children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The main bulk of consuming units in Australia are the <span class="highlight">families</span> with a male breadwinner and the <span class="highlight">families</span> where the wage is the source of consumption expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So we are talking about the shifting of 2500 or 2600 men and women and their <span class="highlight">families</span> from the industry in Whyalla to another area where we hope that they can find jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The reports of the Social Welfare Commission established quite clearly the overlap in indentifying low income <span class="highlight">families</span> in old, established inner city areas and new settlers in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of these prejudices has been a broad social stigma attached to single parent <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It does not recognise the position of <span class="highlight">families</span> where the mother is lost from the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This prejudice is reflected in the way welfare benefits are provided automatically for fatherless <span class="highlight">families</span> but not for motherless <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Professor Henderson’s research has shown that a very significant percentage of motherless <span class="highlight">families</span> had incomes below the poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is no question that improved income support, improved domiciliary care, improved child minding facilities and a more equitable disbursement of welfare funds between lone fathers and lone mothers would go a long way towards relieving some of the pressures on these <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that the Minister for Social Security  (Senator  Giulfoyle) is  aware  of  this problem and is very concerned about these <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These poor <span class="highlight">families</span> will benefit most. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are the poor <span class="highlight">families</span> who the honourable member for Chifley was denying the opportunity of finding out what benefits were available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I should mention here that the family allowance scheme, which is estimated to provide $16m directly to Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span>, is not regarded as a substitute for special Aboriginal programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will however have special significance for Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  pointed out to the House on 25 August the family allowance scheme involves funds which go directly to Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span> and gives them an independence and capacity to spend those funds as they believe best in their own interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They should go to Broome, for instance, and look at the disgraceful and degrading conditions in which a hundred or so <span class="highlight">families</span> live there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The action of your Government will create and perpetuate over-crowding of <span class="highlight">families</span> in sub-standard conditions. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Additionally he fails to take note of the fact that those people coming into Australia under the present polley are skilled workers for trades where there are shortages of people in this country, and are being reunited with their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is saying that when certain members of <span class="highlight">families</span> want to come to Australia under the policy of the present Government they should be left where they are because members of the Labor Party do not care about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did not the Minister and indeed the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  immediately the disaster was made known to them communicate the total support of this Government in terms of financial commitment and in terms of offering to the relatives of those victims in Australia the assistance of the Australian Government in having their <span class="highlight">families</span> brought to Australia without the normal formalities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those here are usually young men who came as forerunners for their <span class="highlight">families</span> to establish themselves in Australia and then to bring out their <span class="highlight">families</span> afterwards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I talk of the Italian organisation called FILEF (Federation of Italian Labourers, Emigrants and <span class="highlight">Families</span>) which until this year had been serving a purpose which the present Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  said was valuable among Italian migrant workers in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the present immigration restrictions there are large numbers of migrants who have raised immigration queries relating directly to members of their <span class="highlight">families</span> who may or may not, in the final analysis, qualify for entry to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reunification of <span class="highlight">families</span> or of persons with close ties is important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman finished his speech by saying- and I tried to write down what he said- that this Government will make it easier for Rhodesians to come to Australia than for reunions of <span class="highlight">families</span> from the Lebanon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know perfectly well that the Tahweel family and the Juaclid <span class="highlight">families</span> and four or five others from Tripoli have been able to get here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, that system has been changed to the system of family allowances which does most to assist low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, the people whom I hope, and I am sure, the honourable member would want to support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In line with the criteria established in relation to that exercise, split <span class="highlight">families</span> were reunited whenever possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In those circumstances and in line with the general policy relating to the reuniting of <span class="highlight">families</span> in this program, assisted passages were granted to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With inflation running at 12 per cent, even to maintain the dollar value of the Labor Government’s commitment this Government should have outlaid $21m as against the $14.5m it has allocated to an industry where thousands of farmers are leaving their farms, where farmers’ <span class="highlight">families</span> are dismayed and distressed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The decision to have talks in relation to refugees who want to reunite with their <span class="highlight">families</span>, whether that reunification is here or elsewhere, was also taken to help the refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>I remember very clearly the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition in relation to people who were in that city and to requests made by people in Australia regarding their relatives, fiancees, husbands, wives and <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To that end not only have we provided help through the Indonesian Red Cross, but the Prime Minister has also initiated negotiations to see in what way help might be provided to enable some sort of reconciliation of <span class="highlight">families</span> or reinvolvement of <span class="highlight">families</span> either from Timor to Australia or, if they so request, from Australia to Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it has been demonstrated quite clearly by myself as the responsible Minister, and by this Government since we came to office, that we have a compassionate approach in relation to the reuniting of <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is having the effect of splitting <span class="highlight">families</span> and is solidifying a situation which denies access to Australian authorities by those without any financial clout. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This sorry record could have been averted if the proper administrative arrangements had been made at the appropriate times and if the Minister had not raised Lebanese hopes unduly earlier in the year with his confident assertions about the <span class="highlight">families</span> and relatives of Australianresident Lebanese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We realise that there are some other <span class="highlight">families</span> that are going through great difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In all cases, <span class="highlight">families</span> are worse off each week, and if they are paying Medibank tax on top of that they are considerably worse off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This situation may not present great hardship to all young people, especially those with <span class="highlight">families</span> capable of supporting them, but for many others very real hardship results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is now in operation and with the large increase in rates it will benefit in particular large <span class="highlight">families</span> with low incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The rate of handicapped children’s allowances has been generously increased to try to overcome the impact of inflation, which is affecting <span class="highlight">families</span> with handicapped children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It looks as though the news is bad and the future is bleak for <span class="highlight">families</span> because there is no intention on the part of the Government to increase the payments for dependants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I seek leave to have incorporated in  Hansard  a table which takes into account the tax rebate system which we introduced and which represented a significant redistribution of resources to <span class="highlight">families</span>, indexed with the personal tax indexation figure of 13 per cent plus the cumulative child endowment for different size <span class="highlight">families</span>, and which shows that under the new arrangement <span class="highlight">families</span> are worse off financially than they would have been if the old system had been retained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I say that because the Henderson Commission’s report clearly showed that the greatest incidence of poverty in Australia occurred in large <span class="highlight">families</span> whose breadwinners were earning the minimum wage or a little more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The allowances under the family allowances scheme were made available not only to taxpayers, as were the rebates under the Labor Party’s rebate system, but to all <span class="highlight">families</span> with dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, 300 000 <span class="highlight">families</span> with 800 000 children will receive family allowances in circumstances where those allowances in no way replace a tax benefit, because they were not taxpayers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now, as the inflation rate comes down and people are receiving some of their own funds, we are achieving a stability and a sense of security for <span class="highlight">families</span> and people who have benefited by some of the previous Government’s programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the other hand, for quite practical reasons such as the provision of humanitarian aid and the reuniting of <span class="highlight">families</span>, we have to accept certain realities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commission also considered that existing State extension services and appropriate Commonwealth departments be expanded to cater for the counselling needs of farm <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Farm <span class="highlight">families</span> can adopt a number of different adjustment strategies in order to stay on the farm under the pressure of declining net farm income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A more recent survey this year, to which I have previously referred in this House, that of the Presbyterian Church of Australia in Victoria in a survey of farmers in central Gippsland, showed that 65 per cent of farm <span class="highlight">families</span> find it necessary to seek work away from the farm for at least one member of the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The design of human settlements should aim at providing a living environment in which identities of individuals, <span class="highlight">families</span> and societies are preserved and adequate means for maintaining privacy, the possibility of face-to-face interactions and public participation in the decision-making process are provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-41-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was an urgent interim measure aimed at relieving the financial hardship of many farming <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The program would have helped the low and middle income <span class="highlight">families</span>, particularly oneincome and one-parent <span class="highlight">families</span>, to obtain adequate housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was our intention that these funds initially would be made available to <span class="highlight">families</span> whose regular weekly income, excluding overtime and child endowment, did not exceed 1 10 per cent of average weekly earnings in each State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Housing Corporation proposed in this Bill permits us to explore a fresh field of endeavour, that of direct relations between government and private enterprise, and between government and non-prom organisations, in the housing of the large number of ordinary Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Housing Commissions have concentrated on caring for poorer <span class="highlight">families</span>, but other forms of assistance for housing are needed in Australia at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Government certainly wanted to assist people overcome the deposit gap because one in five of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> at present have to go to finance companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This could subsequently be extended, if it is possible financially, to include a communication network between all deaf people and between them and their <span class="highlight">families</span>, relatives and friends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That system concentrates the benefits of assistance in low income <span class="highlight">families</span> who just could not take advantage of the previous arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that way this Government has been able to assist some 300 000 low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and 800 000 children of those <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This proved, as far as I was concerned, that the early whalers, the Mahoneys and the Hentys, and the other <span class="highlight">families</span> there, had not pillaged the ship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Politicians’ <span class="highlight">families</span> are probably the most long-suffering in this country and none of us could do our jobs as well as we do- whatever degree of effectiveness or virtue there may be in our performance- without the support of our <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will these <span class="highlight">families</span> be denied benefits of home ownership- like those in our community who earn between 95 per cent and 135 per cent of average weekly wages- by a mechanism of high interest rates and the creation of the arbitrary repayment gap? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As we follow what the Minister for Transport has done and said nation-wide and what the honourable member for Braddon has suggested, the following situation emerges: The Minister for Transport has put people out of work; the honourable member for Braddon now says: If those people who are out of work seek some level of assistance to pay off their homes to feed their children and to educate their <span class="highlight">families</span>, is it not reasonable that they should go out and dig some holes in the road, clean up some parks, or do some other kind of public work? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Henderson inquiry into poverty in Australia recognised, for example, the plight of large low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and the Government immediately introduced the family allowance scheme in order to provide greater help to those who needed it most. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But we have to take into account the psychological effect that such a situation has on people who are sitting a few hundred yards away from guns trained on homes and <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, this is not an amount upon which growers may live and maintain their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The remarks of the honourable member for Moore ignore the social implications to <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He refers to the reform by the introduction of family allowances that enables individuals and <span class="highlight">families</span> to spend government financial assistance in the way that they choose, not in the way that the Government sets down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is little evidence that the size of <span class="highlight">families</span> can readily be manipulated by the Government of a democracy to achieve specific population goals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some countries have used economic incentives … to discourage large <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any event, incentives to have larger <span class="highlight">families</span> could be very costly, even to the point of drawing resources away from other welfare programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has worked out for some <span class="highlight">families</span>; it has not worked out for others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think many migrant <span class="highlight">families</span> coming to Australia who have had to meet the cost of their own passage- substantially that is now the case- would be in a position to enter into contracts to purchase houses at other than disastrous rates of interest, almost usurious rates of interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think many migrant <span class="highlight">families</span> would be in a satisfactory position to start using resources such as requirements for housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He talked about the Government perhaps invoking policies that would encourage larger <span class="highlight">families</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the question of any stepping up of the immigration program on the basis of family reunions this will necessarily mean that because most migrant <span class="highlight">families</span> live in Melbourne or Sydney there will be an increase in the population in those 2 cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously <span class="highlight">families</span> will want to have relatives as close to them as they possibly can be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, we must encourage the reunion of <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Failed to recognise that the inequitable rating system places a burden on low income <span class="highlight">families</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is happening today in the treatment of <span class="highlight">families</span> with young children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This may be appropriate in a majority of cases; nevertheless many taxpayer <span class="highlight">families</span> are disadvantaged by this system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of 2-income <span class="highlight">families</span> is rising rapidly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many do so because they choose to care for their own children in spite of the high price they pay by way of the personal income their <span class="highlight">families</span> forgo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, let what we have done be taken into consideration right now in wage deliberations, along with the new system of family allowances, which has also operated since 1 July last year and which is of very great net benefit to some 300 000 low income Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are a number of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span> who do live in normal average standard housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The number of <span class="highlight">families</span> of Aborigines in Australia is unknown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means that there are probably 20 000 <span class="highlight">families</span> who need immediate and urgent housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The housing for an Aboriginal family in Arnhem Land, is different from the kind of housing that is required at Port Hedland, and the housing in either place would be completely irrelevant to the houses of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span> who live in the capital cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An attack upon the nutrition of many Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span> would solve some of the problems in other health fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government Departments will have to be more adventurous in appointing Aborigines to executive positions and in appointing Aborigines to managerial positions on reserves, ensuring Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span> do have the opportunity to live in houses in the same standard of living as the rest of us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They saw a way out- a rural environment in which they could bring up their <span class="highlight">families</span> in their traditional way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>About 100 <span class="highlight">families</span> sold up their homes and moved into the Goulburn Valley to grow tomatoes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most migrants to Australia come here either because they have <span class="highlight">families</span> already here and as a result can integrate into the Australian community relatively easily, or have job qualifications that ensure that they will be readily employed and whereby able to sustain themselves in their new home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only interpretation that that can be given is that there should be no income test for <span class="highlight">families</span> in relation to unemployment benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Third, the health and welfare of their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What would his Cabinet of wealthy graziers know about the problems of working wives, women with disabled husbands, women who travel hours to work each day to support their <span class="highlight">families</span>, migrant women with language barriers, women who break down from overwork or stress or the pressures of large <span class="highlight">families</span>, women caring for elderly relatives on pensions or low incomes, women cut off from any chance of recreation or enjoyment, women condemned to drudgery and isolation in poor houses or dreary jobs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is time we recognised that women not only have a right to work if they want to but in most cases they need to work to support themselves and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In other words, those benefits would go directly to a number of wealthy <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a joint communique issued at the conclusion of the visit to Indonesia in October 1976, the Prime Minister and  President  Soeharto announced that they had agreed that Australian and Indonesian officials should meet to resolve the problems of the East Timorese evacuees who came to Australia without their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government has agreed in principle to a visit to Australia by an Indonesian team to consider applications by any Timorese who wish to be reunited in East Timor with their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government has very much in mind the distress occasioned by the separation of <span class="highlight">families</span> and arrangements are proceeding for the visit to East Timor to take place as early as circumstances permit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is seeking from sponsors details of the disposition of their <span class="highlight">families</span> so that all relevant factors may be considered in assessing the eligibility of their nominees for entry to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, many East Timorese <span class="highlight">families</span> are divided and are living in different parts of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not evacuees-  who had gone to Australia without their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some instances children are now living in Hong Kong, husbands in East Timor and wives in Australia where they are earning a living to supply the wherewithal to enable their <span class="highlight">families</span> to exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have proof that <span class="highlight">families</span> are placed in such circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that these categories ought to be interpreted in a wider sense, but the criteria should not restrict the Minister’s capacity to make sure that there is no impediment to reuniting <span class="highlight">families</span> which have been divided as a result of this terrible thing that has occurred in East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maintenance and reinterment of the remains of early pioneers would be the main expense, but I envisage that many <span class="highlight">families</span> would be happy to cooperate if they knew that their ancestors or relatives were to be given a place of national honour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister whether he will apply the same conditions to the <span class="highlight">families</span> of refugees- and they are refugees- presently in Australia as he applied to the people from wartorn Lebanon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was of greatest benefit to low income <span class="highlight">families</span> from wherever they may come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While aged relatives may not have contributed through taxes they are an important part of family and community life and the cost of supporting aged relatives of migrants is one which must be recognised and borne by the country inviting immigrant <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the chapter on Italians in Australia attention was drawn to the sizeable proportion of Italians in the lower income groups and the consequent considerable strain on such <span class="highlight">families</span> of bringing out elderly parents mainly because they do so under a system of maintenance guarantees which leaves them for a time ineligible for government assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the unfortunate things that has occurred in the Western World in recent times is the necessity for the 2-income or 3-income family because this prevents women who wish to stay at home and increase their <span class="highlight">families</span> from doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As you will know, the Government has been anxious to reorient the Children’s Services Program to give greater emphasis to the provision of child care services for <span class="highlight">families</span> in need, particularly single parent and low income <span class="highlight">families</span> where it is necessary for the mother of young children to go to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That factor must surely be an important item in the budgets of average income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding the arguments I have advanced for increasing our immigration program over the longer term, I submit that this Government and all future Australian Governments have an obligation to ensure that we amend the present social and economic structure of Australia so that those women who wish to raise a family are no longer penalised or discriminated against as compared with the typical 2-income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many workers see migrants as a threat to job opportunities, either to themselves or to members of their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many of the source countries from which our migrants have come the family means not merely a dependent parent or a dependent child but brothers and sisters and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has changed the basis upon which our <span class="highlight">families</span> have been built. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Periodically, I suppose, those of us who were born in this country and those of us whose <span class="highlight">families</span> have lived here for generations remark on the supposedly volatile nature and temperament of a good many people who have come here in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State governments’ offices in London are undoubtedly being used as a back door way of bringing British migrants to this country in preference to persons from other countries who, I believe, have just as good a claim to come to Australia to make new lives for themselves and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the most significant of all is that any reversal in declining fertility or 2-child <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia is unlikely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, one in six <span class="highlight">families</span> in Sydney and Melbourne had unsewered homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, a lot of <span class="highlight">families</span> rely on the wife working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In many cases they make out very persuasive arguments of this nature in favour of the reunion of their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There no doubt that the best way in which we can bring about the reunion of <span class="highlight">families</span>, particularly the brothers and sisters of people already in Australia is to bring about a swift resolution of the economic climate in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was a tragedy and a great national loss because the loss of family security and cover could mean financial hardship for thousands of <span class="highlight">families</span> should a breadwinner suddenly die. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In particular, those people who are unemployed, who are unable to get work, who have <span class="highlight">families</span> to support face a far more difficult time than other persons in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most cruel, inhumane and callous exercise of all is that conducted against those people who are continually unemployed, those people who through no fault of their own do not have any say over the job opportunities that are available to them, who have <span class="highlight">families</span> to keep and who are persecuted by the Government and its back benchers as being some kind of bludgers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The housing allowance vouchers are an innovation to provide a subsidy direct to <span class="highlight">families</span> according to their personal needs and will commence in an experimental form at the beginning of next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under this approach, <span class="highlight">families</span> who cannot afford even a modest standard of accommodation will receive a special housing allowance based on family size and income and the cost of a standard house or flat in the local housing market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I also suggest that the State governments which build pensioner units should endeavour to give greater consideration to allocating units or flats- whatever one may wish to call them- in areas in which the occupants can be near their relatives and particularly their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I was saying, I think it is very important that we ensure that this accommodation is allocated to people in areas where they can be close to their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have stressed in the past and I stress it again that those people who earn up to 135 per cent of the average weekly earnings find it extremely difficult to meet the repayment gap- it is a repayment gap situation- particularly single income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am trying to find the right words to express the situation without downgrading the excellent residents of that sort of area- persons who are underprivileged because of lack of understanding through migrant origin, lack of opportunity, lack of economic means, single parent <span class="highlight">families</span>, latch-key children, people fromousing commission areas and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, in view of these findings, does the Minister think it advisable to consider a change in the direction of support for <span class="highlight">families</span> by placing more emphasis on means tested income support schemes for parents of young children rather than devoting more resources to the building of child care institutions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most of the balance is spent on a range of services of a nature designed to support the family and in particular to give expression to the Government’s wish to give child care to needy <span class="highlight">families</span> where the children otherwise would be without care of any kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At a time when this nation is suffering from record unemployment, an entrenched high level of inflation and a record deficit, the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  has flitted overseas to escape the problems at home, being more concerned about the quality of his sleeping accommodation on an international airliner than about the awesome difficulties being faced by the 350 000 Australians who are unable to get work and who are trying to provide for their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was responsible in the first instance for taking up with the then Minister for Immigration and Ethnic affairs the question of  Mr Salemi’s  readmission to Australia after he had been out here at the special invitation of the Italian Federation of Migrant Workers and Their <span class="highlight">Families</span>, known as FILEF, had gone back home and then had come back again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Outside my electorate, I believe, the problems facing migrant students are being exacerbated by the demographic trend of migrant <span class="highlight">families</span> to move out of inner suburbia or not to settle there as they traditionally did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Suddenly they are disillusioned by the reality of underpaid assembly lines in industry stripping initiative and motivation from <span class="highlight">families</span>, inadequate housing, the desperate struggle for survival, adequate food, clothing and accommodationlet alone the promised luxuries- followed by the ultimate disillusionment, unemployment, with weeks of no income and then receipt of the shameful pittance which this Government expects the unemployed to survive on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am appalled that the Opposition seeks to decry the very substantial and revolutionary tax reforms introduced by this Government, especially as such reforms, in proportionate terms, will assist lower income <span class="highlight">families</span> more than higher income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The resulting huge additional take in taxation meant that they as individuals and as <span class="highlight">families</span> had no capacity to be self-sufficient and had a limited capacity to seek employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite the problems of the building industry there are irresponsible individuals whom we all deplore, who would hold the industry to ransom, who would prevent people from working, who would stop people with <span class="highlight">families</span> from earning a weekly wage because they wish to establish their position of power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I again give an assurance to the House and to nursing nome patients that there is a clear intention on the part of the Government to bring about a new sense of security to nursing home patients and to their <span class="highlight">families</span> throughout Australia as a result of the amendments which we have made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It put additional funds into the hands of large low income <span class="highlight">families</span> where the help was most needed, but in a period of inflation when prices and wages are still rising, when taxes are subject to indexation and social security pensions are indexed, the relative values of those family allowances declines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So, despite all the propaganda about tax cuts, there has been an increase in the tax burden, That, together with the cuts in real wages, means that <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia are worse off in real terms, as I mentioned before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Tell it to the parents of this year’s school leavers- the best educated generation we have so far produced, a generation in which the community and <span class="highlight">families</span> have invested so much and whose expectations were correspondingly and properly higher than those of any previous generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Budget is the first of the last three in which the income position of <span class="highlight">families</span> (as <span class="highlight">families</span>) has taken a step back, rather than a step forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first big improvement for people with dependant <span class="highlight">families</span> came in  Mr Hayden  ‘s tax reforms of 1 975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the rub for taxpayers with <span class="highlight">families</span> has come this year -not with what the Government did, but by what it didn’t do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is on this basis that the Opposition is arguing that ‘the vast majority of taxpaying <span class="highlight">families</span>’ would have been better off had the Government maintained the child rebates and indexed them in 1976 and 1977 in the same way that the other rebates were indexed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Allocations to the State housing authorities are to assist with the provision of dwellings for rental or sale on a concessional basis to low income <span class="highlight">families</span>; those advances bear interest at the rate of 4 per cent per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771004_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The vital difference between voucher funding and current Australian practice lies in formal recognition at law of the fact that basic aid moneys are due to children or <span class="highlight">families</span> and not to institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely most of us can agree that, apart from the growing number of unemployed who are also harshly treated in this Budget, those amongst taxpayers who need most help are lower income group citizens who are bringing up <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As was outlined in the Budget, people in Australia will benefit also from the indexation of dependent allowances, which is also very generous and will go a long way to help Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is time that the States exercised their responsibility and allocated greater proportions of funds into the area of childhood services, not merely into child care or pre-school education but into services to support the family in order that children can be brought up by their <span class="highlight">families</span> and given appropriate care and education so that when they do start school they can begin their formal education without disadvantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposed means test of $1 10.60 per week, which is the level of the minimum weekly wage, plus the allowance of $6 for each child would naturally have the effect of excluding a very large number of <span class="highlight">families</span> who at present receive the benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the 1975-76 system of tax rebates and child endowment had continued and if the child rebate had been indexed in line with other rebates, thousands upon thousands of taxpaying <span class="highlight">families</span>, the vast majority- in fact all on $240 a week or less, which I believe constitute about 80 per cent of tax-paying <span class="highlight">families</span>- would be better off now than under the proposed tax scales we are now debating, plus the present family allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words the cumulative effects of the Fraser Government’s tax changes in distributing income away from low income <span class="highlight">families</span> can be seen by comparing tax rates in 1978-79 as they will be with those that would have existed under the fully indexed 1975-76 scales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Budget is the first of the last three in which the income position of <span class="highlight">families</span> (as <span class="highlight">families</span>) has taken a step back, rattier than a step forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The switch left the income of most <span class="highlight">families</span> pretty much unchanged, but its significance was that it provided greatly increased assistance to about 300,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> with very low incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is on this basis that the Opposition is arguing that ‘the vast majority of taxpaying <span class="highlight">families</span>’ would have been better off had the Government maintained the child rebates and indexed them in 1976 and 1977 in the same way that the other rebates were indexed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Due to the lack of data on supporting fathers- their number, the size of their <span class="highlight">families</span>, their income distribution- and a lack of knowledge as to the number likely to seek assistance and the period for which they would seek it, it is not possible to estimate the exact cost of paying supporting fathers the same benefits as are available to supporting mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are in extreme need at the present time and there is an urgent requirement that governments should look at the needs of <span class="highlight">families</span> to give them support so that they can fulfil the role that has traditionally been theirs and that I believe the Australian community wants them to continue to perform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have been moving inexorably towards a new way of rearing children without giving a second thought to its consequences or the aspirations of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the last two decades <span class="highlight">families</span> have been under immense pressure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes the policy initiatives that have been intended to assist <span class="highlight">families</span> have had a counterproductive effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In many instances, policies are introduced and measures are put onto the statute book without consideration being given to their impact on the viability of <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, many of the responsibilities formerly shouldered by <span class="highlight">families</span> have been transferred to the state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Policies to assist <span class="highlight">families</span> have been given lower priority than those to replan them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet appropriate adjustment has not been made to the financial viability of <span class="highlight">families</span> to take account of changes in wages policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also recommended that, as there are now so many two-income <span class="highlight">families</span> in which both husband and wife are members of the work force, each should when unemployed be eligible for unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increasing number of twoincome <span class="highlight">families</span> makes it imperative that we decide whether women with family responsibilities should be able, if they so wish, to remain within the home to bring up their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These policies must ensure that the standard of living of a family with children and a single income does not compare unfavourably with that of twoincome <span class="highlight">families</span> and of single men and women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Other <span class="highlight">families</span> with dependent children receive no such payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view they are in need of at least as much help as twoincome <span class="highlight">families</span> which suffer hardship when one member becomes unemployed or cannot find a job when he or she is available for work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the survival of many <span class="highlight">families</span> depends on two incomes because one income is insufficient, as concluded by  Dr Myers,  how can society expect <span class="highlight">families</span> with young children to survive on one income? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the criteria used for determining wages no longer takes account- nor should they- of the needs of those wage earners supporting <span class="highlight">families</span>, we must look to the tax structure and the social security system to recognise the needs of <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The social impact of both the tax structure and the welfare transfer system must be looked at to find out the extent to which <span class="highlight">families</span> need more support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These movements stopped temporarily the erosion of public support for <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed the support for <span class="highlight">families</span> must be increased to more realistic levels and must be maintained in value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indexing family allowances at their present levels would not provide <span class="highlight">families</span> with the support that they need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As resources are limited, those <span class="highlight">families</span> with the greatest need should be assisted first. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the <span class="highlight">families</span> which include children under six years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The majority of these <span class="highlight">families</span> are single income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Economic equals, that is <span class="highlight">families</span> with similar incomes, should be treated equally but they are not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor is the system such that <span class="highlight">families</span> are not influenced to choose one course of action rather than another solely because of the greater benefit to their taxation position under one of the options. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also many two-parent <span class="highlight">families</span> with two incomes pay less tax on the same aggregate income than a single income family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tax liability on <span class="highlight">families</span>, especially those with young children, should be independent of the proportions in which the income is received by the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly it could be done by allowing <span class="highlight">families</span> with young dependent children to split their incomes on a notional partnership basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alternatively, the same result could be achieved by increasing the spouse’s rebate in respect of those <span class="highlight">families</span> who are supporting young children from $550 a year to $ 1 ,040 a year and at the same time making an adjustment in the rate at which that benefit is withdrawn by having it withdrawn at a rate equivalent to the standard rate of tax- 32c in the dollar- as the nontaxpaying spouse ‘s income rises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of other things should be done to assist <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We should require that all Government legislation that is likely to have an effect on the viability of <span class="highlight">families</span> is subjected to a family impact statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want it to convene a conference on <span class="highlight">families</span> to assist in the development of a national family policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should also acknowledge the importance of removing the penalties now imposed on <span class="highlight">families</span> by the tax structure either by allowing income splitting or replacing the dependent spouse rebate with a parent allowance at a substantially higher level than present rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely the huge number of migrants returning home indicates the blatant neglect by the Liberal Government of the continuing needs of our migrant <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The effect of this immoral attitude is reflected in the educational and social deprivation of significant numbers of migrant <span class="highlight">families</span> who are brought to this country and then virtually abandoned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the family allowance scheme, the supporting parents’ benefit and the new policies of” expanding the domiciliary care benefit and helping those <span class="highlight">families</span> which have a handicapped member, which are designed to relieve the additional burdens on the parents of handicapped children so that their financial costs will not be greater than those of parents who have normal children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The drop in interest rates will still mean that purchasing a home will be well out of reach for most Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> that are seeking homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government has revised the home interest tax deductibility scheme in such a way that it concentrates on assisting home buyers in the early years of home ownership and those people who battle against circumstances to establish a way of life and a home for themselves and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They stayed in these homes and often people with large <span class="highlight">families</span>, people from broken homes and people who were on the poverty line were unable to obtain this rental accommodation consistent with their capacity to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, 86,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> and individuals below the poverty line, out of a total of 146,000 with incomes less than 120 per cent of the poverty line, were renting privately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The aim and hope of many Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> to own their own home is certainly brought within the reach and grasp of ever so many people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time, there were 26,735 <span class="highlight">families</span> on the waiting list. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is equally as bad, if not worse, in Victoria where only 2,531 dwellings were completed in 1976-77 and there are 20,359 <span class="highlight">families</span> on the waiting list. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conservatively estimate that at least 300,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> are waiting for housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means that there would be 100,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> on the government housing commissions’ lists and at least 200,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> looking for loans from banks, credit unions and building societies to build their own private dwellings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will be a national tragedy if this Government succeeds in winding down and destroying by stealth and denial of finance such an instrument that alone, in these days of high inflation and high interest charges, can satisfy the aspirations of so many working class <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can understand the desire of <span class="highlight">families</span>, which have rented housing commission accommodation over a long period, to purchase what is in fact their home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member said that this legislation would in no way reduce the backlog of <span class="highlight">families</span> waiting for Housing Commission homes, that under this agreement we would build fewer houses than we built in 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the assistance which will be provided in the form of rebates on the basis of the charging of market rents will mean that many lower income <span class="highlight">families</span> will pay substantially less than 85 per cent of the market rate which was suggested as being appropriate by the honourable member for Reid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore the real household disposable income of <span class="highlight">families</span> will increase and that will also reduce their hardship situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The point is that Government expenditure cannot continue to escalate in line with the trend of recent years because if it does the opportunities for people to do what they want with their money, for the benefit of their well-being and that of their <span class="highlight">families</span>, will be reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Acting Prime Minister recall the stringent criticisms made by the members of this Government when in opposition of the acceptance of gifts by the Prime Minister and Ministers and their <span class="highlight">families</span>, and the precise procedures set by the present Government to be followed in respect of such gifts? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why is his Government now refusing to disclose, as promised, the number, value and location of gifts received by Ministers and their <span class="highlight">families</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As the Government claimed at that time that this decision would facilitate the reunification of Timorese <span class="highlight">families</span>, I now ask the Minister: Firstly, how many East Timorese <span class="highlight">families</span>, if any, have been reunited since the integration was recognised? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, how many East Timorese people in Portugal have been reunited with <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia since the recognition? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are working assiduously to bring about the reunification of <span class="highlight">families</span> from East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet the position of lower income rural <span class="highlight">families</span> continues to decline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>But the assistance given by this Government has not only enabled those men to stay on their farms with their <span class="highlight">families</span> but also given them a prospect of carrying on to the point where it seems the beef market is about to improve significantly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">families</span> of the producers, the <span class="highlight">families</span> of rural workers, the businesses in the country towns, the builders and other tradesmen are the people who feel the brunt of the failure of the Government to protect the rural industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They include the unemployed and others receiving government benefits, such as the lone parents; low wage earners supporting large <span class="highlight">families</span>, and people with chronic recurrent illness which results in  short  periods of absence from work and consequent loss of wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only do the healthy subsidise the sick but the single person subsidises the married person, the young subsidise the old, the middle-aged person subsidises both young <span class="highlight">families</span> and old contributors, small <span class="highlight">families</span> subsidise large <span class="highlight">families</span>, and males subsidise females in most age groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the present time if a large fund such as the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia or Medibank Private offered deductibles it could assume that the healthier persons subscribing to the fund would take out the deductibles- younger people, single people, persons with small <span class="highlight">families</span>, people who have reason to believe that it is a fair bet that they will not be spending $ 100 or $200 on health care during the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true that low income <span class="highlight">families</span>- in his speech the honourable member for Prospect recognised that there are low income people, particularly those on unemployment benefits- could be disadvantaged by some of the changes, but I put it to the House that these people on low incomes, those whose pensions do not enable them to benefit from what are commonly called the fringe benefits, could go to their doctor if they are chronically ill or have a long term illness and claim from their doctor the right to one month’s supply of pharmaceuticals and two repeats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think that is fair because it imposes a further burden on people who are already handicapped- large <span class="highlight">families</span>, those with sick people in the family, people in the older age groups and the very young age groups who need medical or hospital attention more often. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is that the guidelines for the acceptance, valuation and disposal of gifts recieved by the Prime Minister, Ministers of the Government and their <span class="highlight">families</span> in association with their duties were laid down in March 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think in the end one has the philosophical attitude- I certainly have it- that the whole community should contribute towards the health costs of those who have larger <span class="highlight">families</span> and sicker <span class="highlight">families</span>- some members of the family are chronically ill- and who therefore have to take out extra insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780815_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-84-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last Wednesday, when the impact of the 1978-79 Budget became known to the people of Australia, there was revolt amongst the wage and salary earners of this country and amongst the <span class="highlight">families</span> of this country and there were celebrations in the stock exchanges and by foreign investors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They would have to have rocks in their heads if they thought that 250,000 workers in the Public Service of this country would bow to the dictates of this Government; that unless they and their <span class="highlight">families</span> accepted a substantial reduction in their living standards they would be dismissed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Few people seem to be aware that, on a constant basis, servicemen are required to move with their <span class="highlight">families</span> from place to place throughout Australia, often on a two-yearly basis, thereby disrupting home life, family life and the schooling of the children and thereby causing the onflowing effects which appertain in relation to the wellbeing of the children, their development and growth and their capacity to cope with the educational system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The great majority of these people had come from an environment, prior to 1914, which generally speaking would certainly not have equipped them to purchase, almost ad lib, homes for their <span class="highlight">families</span> when they returned to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor alternative would see $450m injected into housing and capital works where there is such a catalogue of pressing need- for example, public rental housing to reduce the waiting list of more than 90,000 <span class="highlight">families</span>; construction in the Macarthur development centre; Aboriginal hostels in remote areas; community health centres, and aged persons accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let there be no doubt: This Budget will lead to improved economic performance over the course of the current financial year and to better living standards for Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a Budget which is specifically designed to ensure that the burden, the costs and the suffering which are afflicting Australian people should be borne by the ordinary wage and salary earners, by the people who are unable to take a place in the work force- by the unemployed, by the pensioners, by the sick and the aged- and by the <span class="highlight">families</span> of this nation which traditionally have produced this country’s wealth but which are rarely in a position to influence the way it is distributed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So for perhaps half or less than the current maximum health insurance levy of $300, on a family basis, Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> will be able to receive the benefits that are currently provided by Medibank Standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is, those 20 units of five per cent each-  in total net worth have been calculated after arranging the <span class="highlight">families</span> in ascending order of net worth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The table shows that the top 5 per cent of the <span class="highlight">families</span> in terms of net worth has 24.6 per cent of total net worth and the top 5 per cent in terms of assets holds slightly more than 22 per cent of total value of assets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bottom 50 per cent of <span class="highlight">families</span> has about 1 5 per cent of total net worth, which means that the top 50 per cent <span class="highlight">families</span> has almost 85 per cent of total net worth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As my colleague the honourable member for Lalor  (Mr Barry Jones)  pointed out last night, the top 10 per cent of <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia possess 36.5 per cent of total net worth, whilst at the other end of the scale the lowest 20 per cent of <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia possess one per cent of total net worth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Dealing with broken marriages and the splitting up of <span class="highlight">families</span> is one of the saddest, most heart-rending aspects of the work of a private member of parliament in his electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government’s action will have the effect of placing extra, and intolerable, financial burdens on many <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An inevitable by-product of these decisions will be that many more <span class="highlight">families</span> will need to become dual income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the only way that many <span class="highlight">families</span> will make ends meet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, while it has robbed the family budget and increased financial pressures on <span class="highlight">families</span>, the savings the Government will make from its changes in this area are meagre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Budget is clearly a direct attack on <span class="highlight">families</span> and on family life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will have an adverse effect on family budgets, on young people seeking jobs and on family life by forcing both parents into the paid workforce and thus splitting <span class="highlight">families</span> even more than they are now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The table surely shows that this Government has completely failed the <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am not necessarily saying that those groups are not in difficult circumstances, but I feel that members of <span class="highlight">families</span> with children and a single income who are trying to establish themselves are the worst off group in Australia at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Much hardship, much suffering and much trauma was caused to many Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> by the fear that was stirred up by irresponsible newspaper editors and supporters- of course, they all came from the metropolitan areas- indicating that this or that was not going to be included in the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They may accept the Government’s pledges that they will be paid 40 per cent of their medical bills, with a $20 limit on what they have to pay, and then suffer the catastrophe of sudden and serious illness themselves or in their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The longer this dispute continues the more the <span class="highlight">families</span> of ATEA members themselves will suffer because the more wages they will have lost; the more difficulties there will be for their own people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask them to reflect upon these matters, to assess their position, to consider what is really in their own interests, what is really in the interests of their own <span class="highlight">families</span> and what is in the interests of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it showing no concern for the inconvenience that is being perpetrated on <span class="highlight">families</span> and businesses and the employment opportunities that are being jeopardised, not just by the ATEA members about whom the Opposition seems to be so concerned but also by other workers right throughout Australia who will inevitably have to be put off if this dispute continues to keep our telecommunications services at their present level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Nearly 100,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> are waiting for homes from the Housing Commission and at least half a million people are living in sub-standard housing, and this Government has not only increased the social problems of those elements in the community which need housing and reneged with regard to welfare housing, but it has also reneged on the home savings grant scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the present context one could refer to the problems of homelessness and the need to upgrade existing subsidies in that area, <span class="highlight">families</span> with severely handicapped children, and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is particularly hard on the young of the poor and rural <span class="highlight">families</span> who have left home looking for jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the serious damage that has been done to the parliamentary insitution, does the right honourable gentleman now agree that it is important that all members of this House as a matter of urgency should indicate that they are prepared to disclose their income tax returns as well as the nature of the assets and liabilities of their wives and <span class="highlight">families</span> and that this be done without any further delay? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At an earlier time there was a parliamentary inquiry into this matter, and that inquiry said that members of parliament should disclose their assets but it did not extend this to wives and <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that wives and <span class="highlight">families</span> were omitted would certainly, in the current environment, become a point for criticism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are the <span class="highlight">families</span> and relatives of political detainees in Singapore, many of whom have been detained without trial for 10 to 15 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1 977, the ventilators in the cells in Moon Crescent Centre were closed, thus further aggravating the already poor ventilation of the cells and causing further physical and psychological stress to the detainees and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent months, severe curtailment has even been imposed on foodstuff supplied by <span class="highlight">families</span> of political detainees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The prison diet for political detainees is inadequate and political detainees are compelled to supplement their diet with foodstuff from their <span class="highlight">families</span> to ensure their health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus the government has not only refused to improve detainees ‘ prison rations( which are in some respect worse than that for convicted prisoners), it has also seen fit to prevent detainees’ <span class="highlight">families</span> from adequately supplementing the prison diet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since April this year, the political detainees have been protesting against these persecutionary measures, staging sitdown protests after each visit because prison authorities have refused to discuss the issue of foodstuff brought in by the <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I will illustrate as my colleagues who have spoken in this debate have already done, how the burdens fall on pensioners and <span class="highlight">families</span>, particularly <span class="highlight">families</span> with young children who are the recipients of the family allowance which was substituted a couple of years ago for tax rebates based on the number of children in a family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the intention of this proposal is commendable the effect of it on ordinary <span class="highlight">families</span> where a child shows some initiative by earning income from such activities as selling newspapers is not at all commendable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Workers are now penalised too if they drink, smoke, drive a car or take their <span class="highlight">families</span> on an interstate holiday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course we have brought in the family allowance, a major innovation of tremendous benefit to Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Stated simply, one side says that we have too many nursing homes and we rely on them, like an elephant’s graveyard for the old, when people get too difficult for their <span class="highlight">families</span> to manage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know, and so do many people in Australia, that some <span class="highlight">families</span> cannot wait to get their elderly mother or father out of their home and into an institution or a nursing home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt in my mind that a great deal of the social tensions between <span class="highlight">families</span>- I would think that a good deal of the break-up of marriages- comes from the inadequacy of the home to be able to give people reasonable privacy or comfort in need or to allow parents or anybody else to feel at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since that level of education has now been stipulated as necessary for apprenticeship at the mining operation, this will tend to keep the <span class="highlight">families</span> together in the town. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">families</span> will not be broken up because the children will not have to go away to undertake their senior examinations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There ought to be a standard means of recording every artefact which presently exists in historical societies or local museums on a national register and that those people who are so surely amateurs and who would concede that they are amateurs have some body of expertise to whom they can turn to ensure that the artefacts which are presented to them usually by old <span class="highlight">families</span> in the community, will be preserved for the future benefit of Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With a few exceptions the stories which have emerged from Cambodia in the past two years have confirmed the impression, given by the early refugees, of a vast and somber work camp where toil is unending, rewards are nonexistent, <span class="highlight">families</span> are separated, and murder is a constantly used tool of social discipline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Insofar as the State governments’ public welfare housing is concerned, nearly 100,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> are on the housing commission lists, waiting for homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is making these cuts at a time when nearly 100,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> are waiting for homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is most disturbing about these cuts is not only their depressing effect on the home building industry but also the callous disregard that the Commonwealth Government has shown for the 28,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> in New South Wales now on the New South Wales Housing Commission waiting list. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can understand the Government’s original proposition which aimed to exclude from receipt of the family allowance those <span class="highlight">families</span> in respect of whom a trust had been set up to reduce taxation and therefore benefit the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, in 1973-74 the bottom 10 per cent of <span class="highlight">families</span> received only 2.8 per cent of total income, whereas the top 10 per cent received 25.47 per cent of total income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Government cash benefits redistribute income towards greater equality by transferring a substantial amount of income to the <span class="highlight">families</span> in the very low income ranges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was found that benefits are given to low income <span class="highlight">families</span> mostly irrespective of socio-demographic characteristics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This shows disproportionately high home ownership among the <span class="highlight">families</span> in the lower income ranges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said earlier today, at least 100,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> are on the Housing Commission waiting list. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so I draw to the attention of the Committee a concern that I have expressed in recent times about the need for governments in this country to have a family policy- a policy that is designed to enable the <span class="highlight">families</span> of the nation to achieve the objectives that they would like to achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that as an adjunct to the development of a policy for the Australian family we should institute the preparation of impact statements by government departments so that when they make policy decisions they are required to indicate the way in which they believe those decisions would affect <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the statistics one will see that the great majority of them happen to be <span class="highlight">families</span> in which there are two parents with dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course we should be looking into the question of the impact and effect of unemployment on different <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia today have two incomes whereas others have no incomes because none of the potential members of the work force can get jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We may well have to look into that question to ensure that work opportunities are adequately and equitably shared among Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>- to ensure that each family has a fair opportunity to develop for itself and for its children the opportunities that we would all like them to have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I should say that under our social security system we do make special provisions for <span class="highlight">families</span> where there are children with a single parent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Is the Prime Minister aware that as from 1 November hundreds of thousands of middle income earners and lower income <span class="highlight">families</span> will have to suffer the humiliation of divulging to their local general practitioner their financial standing in order that the local practitioner can determine whether these people are socially disadvantaged? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everything that it has done in the welfare field, including the effects of the taxation adjustments, erodes the position of the family, and especially the position of the middle and the modest income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is to be regretted that through the mass media prior to the announcement of the Budget much trauma was occasioned to, and much uncertainy was instilled in the minds of, many Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I advance the thought to the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  and the Minister for Construction  (Mr McLeay)  who are at the table, that when considering forward planning for good, decent living for all Australian people, they bear in mind that under the arrangements for the payment of family allowances and tertiary assistance there is some discrimination against big <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that the real strength of Australia is in our <span class="highlight">families</span>, the big <span class="highlight">families</span> that have pioneered the harsh land of Australia and made it one of the great trading nations of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe it would be wrong for any government deliberately to design policies in the long term that discriminated against large <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One appreciates the difficulty the Government faces in a tight economic situation, but I hope that the Ministers will as part of the forward planning provide as part and parcel of the Australian social security scheme extra assistance to large <span class="highlight">families</span> because they are the <span class="highlight">families</span> most in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Students in the last two years of secondary school can still get the family and student allowances and I hope that those people who are facing traumas because of incorrect information on the subject sent out by Opposition members from time to time can take heart from the fact that <span class="highlight">families</span> can still receive the student allowance in respect of secondary school children as well as the family allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we want to encourage Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> and encourage mothers to stay at home we must index family allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we have been talking about and what we have been trying to suggest is that the people in the electorate of Batman, a large number of whom have low incomes, a considerable number of whom are social service beneficiaries and many of whom are migrants with <span class="highlight">families</span> that are divided between Australia and countries thousands of miles away, are not now to receive, under the terms of this Budget, the treatment which was promised by this Government prior to the election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has decided to abolish maternity allowances just at a time when a significant number of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> will have to contribute towards medical expenses associated with confinements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree that to individual <span class="highlight">families</span> $30 is not a huge amount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I speak in particular of young <span class="highlight">families</span> which are faced with the burden of having an extra child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, these <span class="highlight">families</span> will be unable to receive benefits in respect of the family allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The opposite is true in respect of the betteroff <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">families</span> which do not qualify under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme, for example, will still receive the family allowance in respect of their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the case in which the child is being used as part of a tax avoidance scheme and has significant income via a family trust or some  othersimilarmethod.Itisverydifficulttojustify  the payment of the family allowance to such <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I again emphasise the fact that we are dealing with the abolition of the family allowance in the case of those <span class="highlight">families</span> which have already passed a means test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there will be no abolition of the family allowance in the case of other <span class="highlight">families</span> whose children are attending tertiary institutions up to the age of 25 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, the Government could have considered increasing the size of the family allowance to a decent amount to aid lower income <span class="highlight">families</span> during a pregnancy and after the birth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister goes back and examines the position he will also see that it was built into the original concept that in many cases the period of childbirth, particularly with low income <span class="highlight">families</span>, would involve some possible loss of earnings to the mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have been told by the Henderson survey on poverty that those groups most desperately in need of real assistance in this community are not so much the unemployed or the age pensioners but the young <span class="highlight">families</span> where perhaps the breadwinner is in receipt of a low award wage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The surveys of the Henderson commission of inquiry show that many of those <span class="highlight">families</span> are living below the poverty line and in respect of - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned to make is simply this: There is an argument that the Government ought to continue to look at the continuing payment of maternity allowances in order to meet the problems of so many <span class="highlight">families</span> which in fact get real benefits from it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members on this side of the chamber say that as a matter of social judgment, given the problems that beset many young <span class="highlight">families</span> throughout Australia in 1978, this allowance should not be abandoned at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say that particularly having regard to the fact that the whole question of health benefits and the full flow of those benefits has yet to be worked out in terms of the impact that it will have on the general living standards of young <span class="highlight">families</span> in this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I invite honourable members to consider that this allowance is a sort of establishment allowance for <span class="highlight">families</span> in the lower income groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If it did that sort of thing and the <span class="highlight">families</span> of low income earners were to be assisted, it would receive far more sympathetic consideration from the Opposition than it would by abolishing it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to broaden a little what my colleague the member for Bonython  (Dr Blewett)  has said in relation to the <span class="highlight">families</span> from which most of those under 18-year-olds come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It denies all the economic pressures that come on to the <span class="highlight">families</span> as a result of the children not being able to find employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In spite of the fact that the recently introduced Budget will increase enormously the cost of living for <span class="highlight">families</span>, the Government ignores the plight of the recipients of unemployment benefits by saying: ‘You will continue over the next one and half years to live on $36 a week. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is likely that the migrants, the Aborigines and the large <span class="highlight">families</span> who are unaware of the possibility of finding a doctor who will bulk bill them will be deterred from seeking early treatment and thus will need hospital treatment later on, at even greater expense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How many <span class="highlight">families</span> in this country require one visit a week to a doctor? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly the Government will tempt many people to gamble on their future good health and many <span class="highlight">families</span> may live to regret their gamble if they are struck by significant illnesses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The young and the healthy will stay out and the <span class="highlight">families</span>, the middle aged and the sick alone will shoulder the cost burden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of not being covered for the difference between 40 per cent and 100 per cent of the cost of visiting a doctor many of them will deny themselves and their <span class="highlight">families</span> the right to visit a doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That because an additional 3,000 passengers have travelled between Tasmania and the mainland by air in the month of September and as pensioners, <span class="highlight">families</span> and tourists have benefited substantially, the standby airfare concession scheme should be made permanent; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I did not know that it was going to permit some discussion on this matter of great importance to the thousands of Lebanese <span class="highlight">families</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the meantime we must express to the Lebanese <span class="highlight">families</span> in this country our great sense of anguish and sorrow that their very beautiful country is being torn apart at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime, sympathies from all members of this House go out to the Lebanese <span class="highlight">families</span> in this country, who week after week and day after day get sad and shattering news concerning their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a consequence, these people find it desirable to take their <span class="highlight">families</span> within the country and to travel fairly extensively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Lalor electorate includes the Royal Australian Air Force bases at Point Cook and Laverton and a significant proportion of my electors are Service personnel and their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is a great social benefit to the many Western Australians who have their <span class="highlight">families</span> split among the various States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Despite these disadvantages Queenstown has consistently maintained a stable population, with third and fourth generations of <span class="highlight">families</span> still working for the company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope also that everybody will understand that we, as Tasmanians, hope and pray that Queenstown will continue in a way that will create employment opportunities not only for the people who are now employed there but also for their <span class="highlight">families</span> and for other people who may come to the town in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">families</span> happen to be better off at the moment as a result of the amalgam of policies put forward from time to time from the variety of portfolios which affect family circumstances, I say that it is due more to good luck than to good management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, individual Ministers could argue that within their particular areas of responsibility, when initiating new measures, they take account of their effect on individuals and <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I suggest that at present there is no co-ordinated approach to the problem of how our <span class="highlight">families</span> fare as a result of any package of policies- whether they occur through time or at a particular time, such as Budget time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I suggested earlier, if changes to direct taxation levels, changes to the health insurance scheme, changes in pensions or family allowances, changes in education funding and other measures all combine either to improve or disadvantage the circumstances of individual <span class="highlight">families</span>, it is more a coincidence than reasoned social policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government policies should be tailored to meet the dictates of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with respect to <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned that governments could, almost by accident and in the absence of family policy, create a positive disincentive for those young <span class="highlight">families</span> at the margin, where a choice can be made, who wish to opt for the one-income situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many ways of correcting the relative disadvantage of single-income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Governments should ensure that for <span class="highlight">families</span> at the margin where there are dependent children, a genuine choice ought to be available as to whether one or both parents work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the field of taxation, I would recommend that the Government investigate the possibility of allowing single-income <span class="highlight">families</span>, if they wish, to split that single income between husband and wife for taxation purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am saying is that singleincome <span class="highlight">families</span>, if they wish, should be allowed to treat their income in a way which will ensure that those mothers who wish to stay at home and raise their <span class="highlight">families</span> should not be prevented by financial circumstances from doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But governments can and should do all in their power to overcome those financial circumstances which might cause undue stress to be placed on <span class="highlight">families</span> and which prevent mothers having a free choice as to whether or not they can stay at home and care for their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where feasible, it attempts to relocate kids with their <span class="highlight">families</span>, find jobs or secure unemployment benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Alternative accommodation for these 14 was found with <span class="highlight">families</span> and other voluntary groups on an ad hoc basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>using personal contacts with <span class="highlight">families</span>, hostels, boarding houses, churches et cetera- experience counts here <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>BYS has built up a list of <span class="highlight">families</span>, boarding houses, church groups and other informal contacts (it also works through radio stations) who can sometimes put up homeless kids, but the process of placement is very ad-hoc and very time-consuming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be fair to say that when children were born into the <span class="highlight">families</span> of honourable members in this House those honourable members were able to take recreation leave or leave without pay from their employment and had the opportunity to assist in the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government’s proposal to abolish paternity leave altogether is a backward step and one likely to cause considerable practical hardship, especially to young <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of withdrawing provisions which certainly were not generous when compared with those operating in other countries, the Government should be facilitating the establishment of maternity and paternity leave provisions in the private sector; providing adequate child care facilities instead of reversing advances made by the Labor Government in this area; exploring ways of providing adequate permanent part-time work for government employees with young <span class="highlight">families</span>, and encouraging the private sector to follow suit; and, finally, investigating the effects of making provision for easier re-entry or retention of career rights for women who stay out of the work force longer to look after children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I inform the House that after the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner),  who is at the table, made some comments last June or July foreshadowing changes in the maternity leave provisions, I received five phone calls from both men and women who were concerned about those provisions, either because they were men married to female public servants or, alternatively, being women, because they were planning <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government seems to believe that it can best meet the problems encountered by working <span class="highlight">families</span> by reducing maternity leave provisions in the Public Service and by retarding the movement to equal wages for equal work and equal opportunity in the work place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation of young <span class="highlight">families</span> has changed considerably since the mid-1960s, above all due to a steady rise in the numbers of gainfully employed women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been commonly agreed that no financial support for <span class="highlight">families</span> can match the earnings of a family where both parents are able to go out to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The best economic support for <span class="highlight">families</span> is to enable those parents wishing to do so to obtain gainful employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly, too, the prevailing opinion among young <span class="highlight">families</span> themselves is that both parents must be able to combine gainful employment with the care of their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this context, the National Health and Medical Research Council has endorsed the policy statements recommended in the document Health Care Policy Relating to Children and their <span class="highlight">Families</span>’ to which the honourable member has referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-39-81">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to various schemes operating around the world for protection and care of children through the utilisation of childless <span class="highlight">families</span>, the aged, and other untapped community resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781115_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-49-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The importance of the scheme used is that it enabled income to be diverted by professional practitioners to the ultimate benefit of their wives and <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I realise, of course, there are people with chronic poor health, or <span class="highlight">families</span> with a number of small children requiring constant medical attention, where some insurance is needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although many people who are sick or who have <span class="highlight">families</span> have to take out health insurance personally, I believe that it would be better for a pensioner to go into a public hospital although he would not have his choice of doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having listened to them in tonight’s debate one would believe that they are advocating that there is a level of income at which parents of <span class="highlight">families</span> supporting dependent children should be on their own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we transfer that across to an explicit payment we have to be careful to ensure that the public identify and realise that <span class="highlight">families</span> caring for children are being recognised as having needs over and above those households who have no dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suspect that one of the grave problems that confronts many <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia is that that very paradox exists in Australia today where, through the social welfare system, we are seeking to do one thing and we are undermining the attainment of the goals we are trying to achieve by the sort of tax system that we are operating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What then becomes relevant is the appropriateness of differentiating between taxpayers having different sized <span class="highlight">families</span> at any one given level of income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we are to present a truly representative Budget- representative of the full extent and nature of public expenditure- then it is necessary for us to recognise that many taxpaying individuals and many taxpaying <span class="highlight">families</span> receive cash benefits from the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In order not to complicate the matter too much I will assume that the whole of the royalty is to be spent equally amongst all Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span> and, as suggested by the honourable member for Dundas, is some form of income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No matter how hard the honourable member tries, no matter how many projects he includes, I say this: If total royalties were to be applied overall to all aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span> they would still not be in a position where they would be receiving an income which would be subject to taxation if it was received by any other Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we divide that $1,000 by five we find that $200 per Aboriginal family is the amount that is to be taxed at the rate of 32 per cent- at an income tax rate- the honourable member for Dundas is asking honourable members to believe that a taxable rate of income should be applied to the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">families</span> in the Northern Territory because of the $200 they will get from these royalties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here we have a Bill which forcibly redeploys and, I suggest, in practice will forcibly retire public servants whose only means of saving their jobs, saving their careers, saving the income which maintains their <span class="highlight">families</span> and lifestyles, is to appeal against the declaration which renders them redeployed or retired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We all accept that the Uniting Church and the Catholic Church- indeed all the churches in our electorates- do their very best to assist broken <span class="highlight">families</span>; but when it comes down to employing permanently people who can help, to finding a refuge for these people, or to these people being told what they should do in these circumstances, I am sorry to say that members of our society still seem to say: ‘Well, it is hard luck for them; it does not happen in my family’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Treasurer assure the House that, in reaching Budget and taxation decisions, the impact of such decisions on <span class="highlight">families</span>, especially single income <span class="highlight">families</span> with dependent children, will be taken into account? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure the honourable member for Sturt that in reaching decisions on Budget and, of course, taxation matters- there is nothing quite so fundamental to budgetary decision-making as the decisions one makes on taxation- the Government will take into account the impact of not only revenue matters but also expenditure matters on Australia’s <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think the record of this Government over the past three and a half years in paying regard to the welfare of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> in its Budget decision-making and in looking to the interests of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> compares very favourably with the record of any government since Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The great sufferers, as I have suggested, are not simply the new home buyers, the young <span class="highlight">families</span> of this nation, but also industry, which was forced to pay higher and higher prices for industrial land in less and less convenient locations but which was unable to get from the financial sector the funds necessary for the replacement of aging capital equipment and machinery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many of us would agree with the criticism offered by that gentleman that, in order to avoid having to feel concerned about the more than 4,000 unemployed and their <span class="highlight">families</span>, Australians have given credence to and perpetuated the dole bludger myth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Coupled with the health insurance cost hikes of the May mini-Budget of around 40 per cent, does this mean that we will see a further substantial cut in the living standards of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> and further erosion of consumer confidence? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the Prime Minister’s tax hoax in the Budget of last night I ask him how much more he expects Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> to pay for his economic incompetence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does the Government’s failure to index family allowances mean that the Government is being dishonest with <span class="highlight">families</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very simply, the facts of the matter are that this Government has given to Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>, through the family allowance scheme, one of the most revolutionary social reforms that this country has seen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, in their case part of the cost of their education at tertiary level comes from Consolidated Revenue contributed in part through tax by their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No such contribution is made by overseas students or their <span class="highlight">families</span> although many are well able to afford such costs and, indeed, would have to pay fees if the student undertook higher education in the home country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matter I wish to raise tonight seems small enough but it is very important to many <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the same time, there are 93,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> on the waiting lists of the public housing authorities and the housing commissions of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a government, we realise that there are many deserving <span class="highlight">families</span> which have to battle and which do not have the resources to enable them to go out into the private housing market to purchase a house or rent accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Other <span class="highlight">families</span>, with some encouragement from government, both State and Federal, will be able to move away from dependence upon public housing accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us also give those <span class="highlight">families</span> that sort of encouragement because when they do become independent they will be able to decide upon the sort of accommodation they should have, where they should live and the size, shape and colour of their house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as the position of <span class="highlight">families</span> is concerned, this Government has a record since it was elected in December 1975, through its Budgets and its other economic decisions, of giving support to the family which is the envy of other political parties in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People will become more aware as the Budget of last Tuesday night bites in, as the unemployment figures rise and as <span class="highlight">families</span> break up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both measures together, increased fees and health insurance rates, will cost most <span class="highlight">families</span> an extra $3.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So where, I ask, are the extra dollars that the Prime Minister claims the Government is putting into the pockets of all Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even so, they will be better off than all those <span class="highlight">families</span> on incomes of $200 a week or less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">families</span>, if they persist with health insurance, will finish  either with nothing or by being worse off to the extent of some $2 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Not all of the Treasurer’s forecasts are as grim as those for <span class="highlight">families</span>, the work force and the vast range of people who depend on government assistance to survive in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By introducing these revenue measures which affect a few but very wealthy institutions in the community which are not making their full contribution to revenue sources in the community, we will be able to ease substantially the tax burden, direct and indirect, on Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Others include increased family allowanceseither an increased spouse’s allowance or a form of family taxation to assist single income <span class="highlight">families</span>- reduced excise on low alcohol beer, a fourth year for the aged person’s capital grants scheme and a scheme to assist those disadvantaged by the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another matter I wish to raise tonight is the matter of the $24,000 which the Government so swiftly donated to the appeal for the <span class="highlight">families</span> of the victims of the Fastnet tragedy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is indisputable that this result is no accident and that the Government has consciously set about reducing the living standards of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the Government is to reduce the living standards of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> so that it can reduce the wage structure in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can look to other statistics for verification in order to gain the contrast between the concern for the welfare of <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia under a Labor Government, and the brutal indifference of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Families</span> of wage earners have been enormously disadvantaged by the way in which the cost of living has eroded their living standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost squeeze which I have mentioned is coming from a number of sources and it is reducing the living standards of <span class="highlight">families</span> because of petrol prices, health insurance and the Government’s incompetence in the way in which it has administered the money market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All that is achieved by increasing the price of petrol is to aggravate inflation, disadvantage Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> and to force an enormous cost on to Australian motorists, most of whom are private motorists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition would have us believe that all one needs to do to profess and to establish concern for the wellbeing of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> is to come into this House, to shout a few slogans, to quote a few selective statistics and to hurl a bit of personal abuse; in that way one establishes a credible economic alternative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, this debate started out with a protestation of concern by the Leader of the Opposition about the living standards of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I share with the Leader of the Opposition a concern about the living standards of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> but I disagree with both his understanding of their present living standards and his recipe for changing those living standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why the Leader of the Opposition is squeamish about inflation and that is why, so long as the Leader of the Opposition comes into this House to debate inflation or the Australian economy, this side of the House will never allow him to forget that when it comes to making an economic statement he is deafeningly silent on inflation, which is the most important single determinant of the living standards of Australians and Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the years to come when we have to service that debt from the annual expenditure of the Budget, the additional annual expenditure which <span class="highlight">families</span> in this country will have to fund, through their taxes, the amount will be of massive proportions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the ordinary Australian family which is carrying the burden of this Government’s mismanagement, not the wealthy <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has taken the Government four years to close a loophole which has been used as a tax avoidance measure by the wealthiest <span class="highlight">families</span> in this country, namely, the family trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through the misuse of the family trust, the wealthiest <span class="highlight">families</span> of this country have, in fact, made quite profitable use of the fact that they have a family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So <span class="highlight">families</span> are still profitable for the wealthiest <span class="highlight">families</span> in the country but they are a distinct disadvantage for the rest of the people in this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet, over the last four years, little by little this Government has eroded the capacity of <span class="highlight">families</span> to survive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The horrifying aspect is that the effect has been greatest on the poorest <span class="highlight">families</span>, on the lowest income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But they are supposed to like <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They forget their <span class="highlight">families</span> and attack them for being students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Students are <span class="highlight">families</span> too, but the Treasurer has forgotten that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us just take a brief look at what this Government thinks about low income <span class="highlight">families</span> in terms of its Budget of just a week ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For <span class="highlight">families</span> on just under $6,000 a year, the lowest income at which tax applies to <span class="highlight">families</span>, there will be nearly a six-fold increase in the amount of tax paid this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what this Government thinks about <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government thinks only about preserving the position of the rich <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It allows the rich still to make a profit out of having a family while it relentlessly assaults the living standards of ordinary <span class="highlight">families</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let me assure him and the Australian people,  Mr and Mrs Australia  about whom he speaks, while in the same breath mouthing policies that will do great damage to them and their <span class="highlight">families</span>, that this Government will not refuse to face the facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, as I have pointed out, this system of making the user pay strikes particularly at <span class="highlight">families</span>, for children constitute a high proportion of cost in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cerainly will increase the burden particularly on single income <span class="highlight">families</span> with a large number of dependent children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Health costs remain 10 per cent of total Budget outlays but low income people, the sick and the chronically ill, <span class="highlight">families</span> with high risk such as large <span class="highlight">families</span>, will be paying a lot more for health coverage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the Australian Bureau of Statistics earlier this year conducted a survey and found a very high proportion, about 30 per cent, of <span class="highlight">families</span> below the poverty line were taking out some health insurance and about 27 per cent of those <span class="highlight">families</span> were taking out full scale health insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other speakers have indicated very clearly what the effect of this discriminatory change will be, particularly on these low income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When many people come from single parent <span class="highlight">families</span>, which is all too common in the western suburbs of Sydney, they are doubly disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is consistently attacking the living standards of <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Families</span> are now much worse off than they were before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a high proportion of young <span class="highlight">families</span> involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that in areas such as mine usually there are many two-income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They find that they need two incomes to be able to raise their <span class="highlight">families</span> and to exist in a proper way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have seen a massive cut in welfare housing buildings with 93,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> now on the waiting list. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I see the hundreds of thousands of unemployed young people who are dependent on <span class="highlight">families</span> receiving incomes of only $150 to $160 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This man would break up <span class="highlight">families</span>, destroy stable lifestyles and send young people out on the road looking for work, which the Government will do nothing to provide in their home city- a company town run by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are very dedicated people, conscious of their situation, very keen to assist their <span class="highlight">families</span> in the present situation which they face. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should at least receive compensation payments which would allow them to live comfortably and be able to raise their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The undeniable fact is that this Budget will cost average <span class="highlight">families</span> an extra $7.90 a week, as the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  said in his speech earlier tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The tax increase has hit hardest at single income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The hospital has served miners and their <span class="highlight">families</span> since 1904. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer right back to the times of the Wonthaggi mine disaster when 13 miners were killed, all of whom were married with <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am delighted to be able to say that, for those people who have chosen to move here from the land of their birth with their <span class="highlight">families</span>, we are providing the infrastructure and the help necessary to make their settling-in program easier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has his attention been drawn to an article published in the  Sunday  newspaper in Sydney quoting  Mr Eric  Risstrom as saying that the Government intends to take advantage of the <span class="highlight">families</span> of dead people’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is  Mr Risstrom  correct in advising <span class="highlight">families</span> that they should make sure that estates are kept in trust and not distributed if this level of tax is to be avoided? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a compensation made to people on the lower income scale, those who have <span class="highlight">families</span> and who are suffering more than any other section of the community because of their responsibilities and their willingness to face up to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost of housing is very important to <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That represents massive support for Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> and a major social welfare innovation introduced by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the questions I have asked in this House and many of the speeches I have made have demonstrated my deep concern for the well-being of Australia’s <span class="highlight">families</span> and of the children in their care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have called for a national family policy; I have urged the use of family impact statements; I have called for increased family allowances; and I have advocated tax reform in the interests of <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members will therefore not be surprised that I am using this opportunity tonight to call upon the Government to relieve the desperate plight of many hundreds of thousands of <span class="highlight">families</span> with dependent children, especially those with only a single income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the majority of people it seems, and often is, removed from the day-to-day problems of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleagues and I were pleased recently to receive the assurance of the Treasurer- a public assurance- that the proposals of the working party for overcoming the tax disadvantage of single income <span class="highlight">families</span> would continue to receive very close study by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposal was formulated because of our concern for Australia’s <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The relative position of <span class="highlight">families</span> with children, especially those with only one income, compared with other households, is worse today than it has been for a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But except for these moves the erosion of public support for <span class="highlight">families</span> has continued for at least two decades. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The financial pressures facing <span class="highlight">families</span> are insufficiently recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to give <span class="highlight">families</span> the support they need we must establish the goals we wish to pursue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our tax and social security systems must not be used only to safeguard individuals and <span class="highlight">families</span> against unpredictable and catastrophic loss of income or to enable the chronically disadvantaged to maintain a decent standard of living; they must also be used to assist individuals and <span class="highlight">families</span> to redistribute their lifetime income from the peaks of relative affluence to those periods of relative poverty which are today putting <span class="highlight">families</span> under so much stress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The unit we adopt should be one which takes into account the situation of those who pay, those who receive and many who do both, not only as individuals but also as members of <span class="highlight">families</span> or households. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major problem of our present system of taxation is that <span class="highlight">families</span> of the same composition and total income are required to pay substantially different amounts in tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two-income <span class="highlight">families</span> pay much less tax than the family in which one spouse is the only breadwinner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, single-income <span class="highlight">families</span> with incomes under $16,608 pay $707 a year or $13.60 a week more in tax than twoincome <span class="highlight">families</span> with the same family income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Families</span> paying the top rate of tax, if they can split their income, can save up to $7,500 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present tax system is one of the chief causes of relative poverty and even hardship experienced by the majority of <span class="highlight">families</span> with children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not treat <span class="highlight">families</span> alike. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would have been necessary on grounds of fairness and would have resulted in two-income <span class="highlight">families</span> paying the same proportion of their incomes in tax as singleincome <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In phasing in reform, we should have two aims: Firstly to reform the tax scales in such a way that no taxpayer pays more tax on the same money income that he does under the present tax scales, and secondly to reduce progressively the proportion of income paid by single-income <span class="highlight">families</span> by way of tax until it matches the proportion which is now paid by two-income <span class="highlight">families</span> with the same household income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At first, indexation should be applied only to the assessment of tax payable by <span class="highlight">families</span> who are disadvantaged by the present tax law, sole parents and taxpayers living alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Selective indexation should continue for a new optional family tax scale until it places single-income <span class="highlight">families</span> in the same position as two-income households who split their incomes under the present arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At current inflation rates, indexation on the optional family tax scale without interruption since the last adjustment would mean that, within three years, the amount of taxfree income available to all <span class="highlight">families</span> would be unaffected by the proportions in which the spouses earn the family income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The benefit would go first to those who are low income <span class="highlight">families</span> and their gain would be proportionately greatest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only when reforms of this kind have been adopted will <span class="highlight">families</span> be given a chance of having a fair go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the unemployed receive their benefits through the post has eliminated the dole queue, but it has not eliminated the anguish and the suffering of hundreds of thousands of decent Australians who simply want a job, or the plight of those thousands of <span class="highlight">families</span> whose breadwinners are unemployed, who live below the poverty line and whose suffering prompted a significant and important statement by the Catholic bishops of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Their work is here, their <span class="highlight">families</span> are here and their children are at school here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition we have introduced a policy of family allowances to assist the lower income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the last four years to the end of this year we will have paid $4 billion to Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> in one of the greatest social reforms of all time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, we have done a number of other things to help Australians and Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bearing in mind that proportionate to immigrants’ representations in the community, there are many more immigrants or children of immigrants who are unemployed and untrained than there are other members of the community, ordinary Australians, in a sense this cut will hit immigrants and their <span class="highlight">families</span> more than the rest of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a very cynical exercise because when immigrants come to Australia we hear a lot about the need to bring in skilled workers and we encourage them to come, but of course we forget that usually they have <span class="highlight">families</span> also- wives and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me put it in the words of the family: You and your <span class="highlight">families</span> can spend only as much as you can earn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Together they constitute a harsh attack on the living standards of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> and are the latest instalment of the Fraser Government’s plan to redistribute income and wealth from the less well off to the wealthy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is something obscene about those kinds of priorities and it comes from a Government and a Prime Minister who profess, tongue in cheek, to have an interest and a concern for <span class="highlight">families</span> in Australia and a concern for people in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The forecast by the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  in the Budget makes it clear that unemployment will soar, inflation is taking off, recession will get deeper and living standards of <span class="highlight">families</span> will be much lower at the end of the year than they were at the beginning of the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-35-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>None of wants to engage in a philosophical debate about that but let me say that I support the statements of the Treasurer  (Mr Howard),  the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and my own leader who believe that it is appropriate for the Government to examine the proposition of the splitting of income in <span class="highlight">families</span> where there is only one wage earner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is obvious that the Government’s plan is to expedite the standing down of workers who, through no fault of their own, may be affected by a dispute and then to deny them eligibility for unemployment benefit in order to starve them and their <span class="highlight">families</span> into submission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government wished to select an issue on which to create industrial confrontation- I believe that that is its snide, ulterior motive in this instance- it could not have selected a more certain means of doing so than expediting the standing down of workers and unionists and then denying them and their <span class="highlight">families</span> sustenance in the form of unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not surprising that he does because he knows quite well that there are about 300,000 <span class="highlight">families</span> and upwards of 800,000 children who got virtually no benefit out of the old rebate system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They got no benefit because the incomes of the <span class="highlight">families</span> of the parents were not sufficient to be able to gain an adequate benefit through the rebate system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How does the Minister justify this increase in health insurance costs, which is forcing tens of thousands of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> to opt out of the cumbersome and confusing system that the Government has created with four major changes of policy in four years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government must sign an agreement with Italy as soon as possible and that agreement must take into account the special needs of <span class="highlight">families</span> of Italian descent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For one reason or another they are not living with their <span class="highlight">families</span> and they have not got enough money to look after themselves properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Often that is seen very much in the terms of the honourable member for Darling Downs, who saw it very much as their responsibility, that they or their <span class="highlight">families</span> have been living in such a way that they have cut themselves off and therefore society itself is not responsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can well understand the feeling of people who have been forced to flee from their homelands because of persecution of themselves or thenfamilies and who have risked their lives in order to seek for themselves and their <span class="highlight">families</span> a new, secure and democratic future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In particular, Soviet penal regulations, and even more so their implementation, fall far short of humane concepts- in the system of punishments, the rights of prisoners to make complaints, to communicate with their <span class="highlight">families</span> and friends, and, most seriously, to receive adequate nourishment and medical care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The repeated changes have destroyed the community rating principle in health and the net result will be that the elderly, large <span class="highlight">families</span> and chronically ill will be unable to afford adequate health cover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian people, particularly <span class="highlight">families</span> and the poor, are crying out for a dependable, understandable, comprehensive system to take the worry out of health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>First home buyers purchase far less expensive dwellings than <span class="highlight">families</span> purchasing a subsequent home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> have long had a tradition of starting out by purchasing a modest home suited to their current needs and realistically within their reach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting that it is in this area of married taxpayers, the <span class="highlight">families</span>, the most heavy tax impost is occurring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This sits oddly with the Government’s claim that it has done marvellous things for <span class="highlight">families</span> by way of increasing family allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, <span class="highlight">families</span> find that the net tax impost on them is increasing all the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There can be significant disadvantage to single income <span class="highlight">families</span> as compared to two-income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two income <span class="highlight">families</span> would not be disadvantaged because they could opt for whichever was the most attractive- the flat rate tax or the existing scales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only <span class="highlight">families</span> that would opt for the existing scales would be those with a combined income of less than $9,500. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As previously mentioned it would only be the genuine below $9,500 income individuals and <span class="highlight">families</span> who would opt for the existing scales and pay less than 20 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The secretary of the committee, the honourable member for McCarthur (  Mr Baume),  says he is concerned about <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also putting forward proposals to help single income <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So much for its concern about <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has this Government got against <span class="highlight">families</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if honourable members look at the net effect, it represented a rip-off to <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With all this kite flying about the concern of the Liberal Party for the <span class="highlight">families</span>, this Government is not prepared to do anything for the <span class="highlight">families</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government introduced the benefits to <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the purely financial aspects, there would be other reasons for transfers between nursing homes, such as re-location of patients’ <span class="highlight">families</span>, preferences of the patients involved, et cetera. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-73-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of these few- from many- examples of the alarming erosion of family living standards, combined with the abolition or watering down of many benefits, what incentives does the Minister offer to encourage the growth of <span class="highlight">families</span> that he has espoused with such uncharacteristic vigour? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when it comes to people, when it comes to <span class="highlight">families</span>, when it comes to things that people really need in this community, the Government is remarkably remiss. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A sort of coldhearted indifference seeps through, whether it is in relation to family allowances or in relation to the provision of adequate library facilities in this country for the people who belong to Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> and who want to improve themselves or who want to relax in some sort of creative and satisfying way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is important because we are demonstrating in respect of family reunions for Timorese people- as we did with, for example, the similar problems in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and also the Middle East- that we are prepared to do our utmost on the basis of humanitarianism to bring together <span class="highlight">families</span> which are disunited by events over which they had absolutely no control such as war and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not believe it would occur if there were more sugar cooperatives in the industry and less of the 60 <span class="highlight">families</span> which sit on the boards of management and control the biggest business in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The cane farmers, who number some 15,000 workers or some 6,500 <span class="highlight">families</span> adhere to the free enterprise philosophy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Once they leave school, young people from poorer <span class="highlight">families</span> set about getting a job, any job without being able to consider such questions as career, opportunities for advancement or selffulfilment which influence the choice of more affluent students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we are going to spend $800 less, by way of public expenditure and capital expenditure, on a child in one sort of school compared with another sort, we want to know how much of that $800 can be made up by <span class="highlight">families</span>- and by poor <span class="highlight">families</span> with numbers of children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I want to stress over and over again that the real problem facing the single income <span class="highlight">families</span>, earning up to  135  per cent of average weekly earnings, whether they live in Sydney or Melbourne, is that they are in a crisis situation when it comes to acquiring a home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a Bill which proposes to deprive many Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> of financial assistance which hitherto had been available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It Will make many Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> worse off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-This Bill will result in one in five <span class="highlight">families</span> who would otherwise have been entitled to benefits under the Home Savings Grants Scheme being denied any benefit at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means two in five Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> will be disadvantaged as a result of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the remaining three out of five <span class="highlight">families</span> that will draw benefits under the established scheme one cannot help querying what real benefit this is in terms of assisting people to obtain their own homes when in fact there is a nine-month waiting period before payment is made to applicants, that is, nine months after they establish their home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is about saving approximately $20m at the expense of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> that want to establish their homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, broadly in the field of housing policy the Government has been recreant in its responsibilities to Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Seventy-four thousand <span class="highlight">families</span> are seeking housing in the public sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is up to the Minister either to outline a program of controlling costs in the home building industry or to introduce programs which will mitigate the rapidly rising cost of acquiring homes for Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those are only some of the ingredients of the neglect for which this Government is responsible and the disadvantage imposed on Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> as a result of Government neglect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> are being disadvantaged because of the indifference of this conservative Government to their needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members on the Government side have any genuine involvement in the needs of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> in terms of home ownership and talk to people involved in the home building industry, they will recognise that the contraction in floor space area available for Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> continues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> increasingly are being forced into cramped conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I move on to the dimensions of the housing problem for <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an impossible burden, and it shows that there is no genuine concern for the home ownership aspirations of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is to disadvantage 40 per cent of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span> acquiring a home who previously would have been entitled to some benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reductions in personal income tax rates are enabling <span class="highlight">families</span> to save the deposit for a home more quickly than they could, again, when the Labor Party was in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The open space could accommodate 200 <span class="highlight">families</span> on the basis of space allocated to flat dwellers by the Housing Commission of Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Victorian legislation also provides for a code of ethics which sets out that all the financial interests of the <span class="highlight">families</span> of the members of that Parliament also will be disclosed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-37-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have suggested that our own remuneration and emoluments should be adequate, indeed high enough, to guarantee that people will not be attracted to the idea of using their office to make substantial gain, either directly or indirectly, when it relates to their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-37-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should be well paid and have adequate remuneration but we think that the suggestion that they should also have other sources of income, assets and other means whereby either they or members of their <span class="highlight">families</span> will benefit through their office detracts from democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-37-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The key weakness in the Government’s decision is that there will be no public register outlining all the pecuniary interests of all members of parliament and their immediate <span class="highlight">families</span>; nor is there any adequate penalty for failure to disclose potential conflicts of interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-37-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: the Government be condemned for not making it obligatory for all Members of Parliament to disclose their pecuniary interest and that of their immediate <span class="highlight">families</span> in a register available to the public’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-37-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are going to live with broken <span class="highlight">families</span>, with crime, with drug offences, with alcoholism, with all the things which come out of high unemployment in this country because the Government refuses to recognise what has to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It implies that the financial support for these young people will really come not just from the Government but significantly from their own <span class="highlight">families</span> who are already in financial difficulty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In most cases this is probably why the children leave school early as they feel that they have to get out and help their <span class="highlight">families</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it possible as a first step to the indexing of family allowances to implement a scheme to index family allowances for <span class="highlight">families</span> who are in receipt of one income on or below the average weekly earning or two incomes which together do not exceed that figure (i.e. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-56-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be possible to implement a scheme whereby indexed family allowances would be payable to <span class="highlight">families</span> where the <span class="highlight">families</span>’ incomes were equivalent to or less than average weekly earnings, but administration would be complex and costly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-56-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would provision be made to vary payments for <span class="highlight">families</span> whose financial and other circumstances change? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-56-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would pensioner and beneficiary <span class="highlight">families</span> be treated in the same way as other <span class="highlight">families</span> or would special arrangements be made to avoid overlapping income tests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-56-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if these matters were resolved, cost estimates would not be reliable since comprehensive and up to date information on the income distribution of Australian <span class="highlight">families</span>, in a form suitable for costing purposes, is not available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-56-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have members of the Philippines Consulate or their <span class="highlight">families</span> been investigated on alleged breaches of the Customs Act; if so, when did the alleged breaches take place and was diplomatic immunity waived by the Consulate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-139">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>If so, why are children requiring this treatment and living within 200 km of Melbourne not eligible for assistance to travel to Sydney under the National Health Act, whilst all other <span class="highlight">families</span> are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-12">[More…]</a></li>
