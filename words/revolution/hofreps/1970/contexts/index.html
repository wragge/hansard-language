  <li>
    <p>Would he support such a demonstration by a protest movement or a moratorium if one were to be organised in Australia, or does he agree with the delegate at the Continental Congress of the Daughters of the American <span class="highlight">Revolution</span> who said: ‘Subversive elements plan to make American children live in an environment that is good for them’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do we think that we have a state of <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in this country which the British do not have? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Labor Party have talked about a  coup d’etat  on 1 1 November as though there was some sort of <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has any request been made to the People’s Republic of China concerning the broadcasts beamed to South East Asia, known under the name of  The Voice of Thailand  and  Radio Suara Revolusi Malaya- the Voice of Malayan <span class="highlight">Revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, has a request been made that these broadcasts cease promoting insurrection and <span class="highlight">revolution</span>, when was the request made and under what circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the second point raised by the honourable gentleman, that is, that three countries, Pakistan, India and Indonesia, because of the green <span class="highlight">revolution</span> that has occurred in those countries, no longer have any necessity for wheat, I point out to him that not only have they a necessity for it, but they are importing it now because they need it in order to feed their hungry millions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the main reasons for the declining world wheat trade - from 2,300 million bushels in 1955-56 to 1,700 million bushels in 1968-69 and possible further decline to 1,500 million bushels in 1969-70 - was the remarkable success of the ‘green <span class="highlight">revolution</span>’ in many food deficient countries, such as India and Pakistan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen vastly reduced aid requirements in India, and Pakistan has developed from an importer of wheat to an exporter as a result of the green <span class="highlight">revolution</span> that has taken place there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Trade and Industry  (Mr McEwen)  announced 3 years ago that containerisation was to bring about a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in shipping, resulting in cheaper freights and cost-free feeder services from outports, but one of the major ports in Western Australia is still waiting for some definite word from this Government as to what containerisation is going to mean to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe he said ‘On with the <span class="highlight">revolution</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The change in technology and in the character of shipping that is necessarily part and parcel of the transport <span class="highlight">revolution</span> which we see about us will obviously bring about changes in docking requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to  Mr Serong  the <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in Cambodia has given the Americans and the Thieu Government an undreamed of opportunity to end the war in 6 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the Communist <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in China in 1949 Australia rapidly orientated its policy and thinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a result of the technological <span class="highlight">revolution</span> which has hit agricultural production in the highly developed countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The experience of many, if not all revolutions shows how very useful during a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> is the combination of mass action outside the reactionary parliament wilh an opposition sympathetic to (or better still, directly supporting) the <span class="highlight">revolution</span> inside it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the words of Lenin for his concept of the way in which <span class="highlight">revolution</span> can be extended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, Lenin wrote to a young enthusiast from Glasgow who suggested that good revolutionaries should have nothing to do with such reactionary things as parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And what a paradise it proved to be on the Communist’s own documentation, because this man soon emerged - not as the benign Uncle Ho, the father of the Vietnamese <span class="highlight">revolution</span>, but as the hard line MaoistMarxist - to impose on the North the kind of conditions that he had seen taking place in the Chinese <span class="highlight">revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What does it mean if it does not mean violent <span class="highlight">revolution</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A clear call has been made to ordinary persons to regard themselves as the oppressed, to sharpen the class struggle, to ferment other grievances, thus leading people into a violent <span class="highlight">revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The truth is that there has been a complete and repeated vindication of the basic truth of all that my colleagues and I said there only 4 short months ago on the eve of the <span class="highlight">revolution</span> which has now been set in train. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is strangely reminiscent of the circumstances that have occurred in Paris time and time again during the course of France’s history, when one republic has been overthrown by <span class="highlight">revolution</span> and replaced by another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The citizens of Paris occupied the streets to change their government by <span class="highlight">revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite have said at times that it is hoped that the demonstrations will be non-violent, that they will be peaceful, but then with a typical cry of revolutionaries they have laid the groundwork for a violent demonstration by saying that if there is violence it will be as a result of police intimidation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During a reactionary war a revolutionary class cannot but desire the defeat of its government  . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wartime revolutionary action against one’s own government indubitably means not only desiring its defeat but really facilitating such a defeat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An understanding of a revolutionary action even in a single country, to say nothing of a number of countries, can be achieved only by the force of the example of serious revolutionary action, by launching such action and developing it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conversion of the imperialist war into a civil war cannot be ‘made’, any more than a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> can be ‘made’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in lesser-developed countries against such political risks as war, insurrection or <span class="highlight">revolution</span>, expropriation or confiscation, and prohibitions against the repatriation of earnings or capital . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 19th century the first industrial <span class="highlight">revolution</span> replaced manual labour by machines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many commentators have referred to what is going on nowadays as the second industrial <span class="highlight">revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone wilh any knowledge of history will know about the horrors of the first industrial <span class="highlight">revolution</span> and how human beings were depersonalised into what were called ‘factors of production’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the degradation of humanity as a result of the first industrial <span class="highlight">revolution</span> under early capitalism that gave rise to the flowering of Socialist thinking throughout Western Europe and caused the rise of the great Socialist movements in Western Europe in the 19th century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is no accident that in this second industrial <span class="highlight">revolution</span> there is an increasing advocacy of greater participation in management and control of industry by the workers and by the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the land is bad enough now even with the use of phosphate and subterranean clover, so one can only imagine how bad it was when the producers relied on native pastures in the sandy, light texured country before the pasture <span class="highlight">revolution</span> came in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-29-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the siratro and setaria pastures there is a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> going on in some of these areas which previously were pronounced marginal dairy farms and which will remain marginal dairy farms until we can get some semblance of sanity in the Queensland Government by its accepting positive and sound schemes like these. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-29-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, I think it is most important too for us to be aware of, and to assess the effect of, the so-called ‘Green <span class="highlight">Revolution</span>’ in Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member for Warringah so rightly said today, we have seen the green <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The retailing <span class="highlight">revolution</span> has mechanised this type of packaging. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in retailing which has made a great difference to farmers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the start of the prepackaging <span class="highlight">revolution</span> and this is what has happened with dairy products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the important point is that free trade economics went out with the industrial <span class="highlight">revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another feature which concerns the Opposition is the <span class="highlight">revolution</span> (hat has taken place in the carriage of freight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This <span class="highlight">revolution</span> has had a widespread effect on the waterfront today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The green <span class="highlight">revolution</span> has resulted in an increase in the production of certain types of grains for which there are no longer big enough markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not mind sitting as they did in the days of the French <span class="highlight">Revolution</span>, when the Legislative Assembly was in constant session. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be, perhaps, almost a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in the procedures of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700821_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Bill such as the Broadcasting and Television Bill carries overtones which reflect the importance of this tremendous field of modern mass communications - a field in which a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> is only beginning to be felt in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we look ahead from those days to the days of the pocket size transistor and tomorrow to colour television in Australia, to pocket television, to very mobile telecommunications in the keeping of the individual, it is undoubtedly true that a tremendous <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in this whole field is only beginning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one looks at the field one must .be aware that this <span class="highlight">revolution</span> means that a completely different base to society is beginning to develop - that there are new powers for the manipulation of society; that there is a sophistication in terms of the presentation of material over the media which has to be scrutinised and understood not only by governments, educators and those who seek to benefit financially or commercially from these things but primarily by the great mass of people who are so often the victims of mass communications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is up to every member to take part in a <span class="highlight">revolution</span>, to vote some sanity and sense into our Standing Orders when the Standing Orders <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there is the problem of what is known as the green <span class="highlight">revolution</span> which has swept over Europe and America, and is now sweeping over Asia, where new types of crops, particularly wheat and rice, have increased tremendously the yield potential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The green <span class="highlight">revolution</span> does therefore have a potential backlash and it may be that this will call on Australian farmers once again to start feeding the hungry East. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He wants not a reform but a <span class="highlight">revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He publicly endorses and recommends <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in the streets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>History has shown - from the industrial <span class="highlight">revolution</span> onwards - that workers have to strive to get increased wages and increased compensation when their standard of living is reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the contrary, the position quite obviously is that in mainland China for quite normal commercial reasons there have been a number of circumstances which have certainly reduced that country’s need to buy wheat this year, lt is true that the green <span class="highlight">revolution</span> is not confined to India, Pakistan or the other countries of South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The green <span class="highlight">revolution</span> has meant that through the use of fertilisers and the use of rapidly growing and high yielding Mexican wheats there is a very substantial increase in production in a great part of Asia, and China has not, of course, been outside that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People get involved in protests and demonstrations for many reasons, but it is undeniable that there is a very small group of people who use protests and demonstrations not to protest about conscription or Vietnam or education but to build up the revolutionary movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is also clear is that the Australian Government has learnt nothing from the automotive <span class="highlight">revolution</span> that is occurring in the rest of the world, particularly the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But in other areas, including neighbouring countries, the Chinese leaders are continuing their support for armed <span class="highlight">revolution</span> and insurgency, and this support is material as weir as ideological. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Later he bought a little ‘Red Book’ to read for himself and to study for the next peace conference - such philosophies as ‘War is the continuation of politics … by other means’; ‘the seizure of power by armed force, the settlement of the issue by war, is the central task and the highest form of <span class="highlight">revolution</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This concern is now being replaced by the long term diplomacy of a more settled China; of cooperation with friendly governments, irrespective of ideology, lt is apparent therefore that this scare diplomacy which emanated from China during the middle 1960s and in particular at the time of the cultural <span class="highlight">revolution</span> is changing, which is not surprising because the cultural <span class="highlight">revolution</span> was the greatest disaster China has faced, lt is my contention that China has a vital interest in ensuring that the Russians do not gain a dominant presence in the Indian Ocean and this is primarily the motivating factor in her relationships and the seeking of a detente as it would be with the Western world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The trouble with ali this planning is that it fails to dovetail trends in various sectors and fails to make provision for the training of efficient planners, so creating a bottleneck in the supply of the sort of people who can understand and apply the knowledge <span class="highlight">revolution</span> about planning and forecasting techniques that has taken place in the rest of the world in the 1960s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The tertiary education assistance scheme, to be introduced for the first time at the beginning of 1974, is a major step taken by the Government in its program to produce a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> of access to education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the aegis of the National Library Act we look to the rapid and co-operative evolution of library and information services in Australia to cope with the information explosion and the technological <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in the handling of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The cultural <span class="highlight">revolution</span> had an enormous effect within China in a number of areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister rightly has talked about a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in access to education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is precisely the point which the Minister made in his second reading speech, that the aim is to provide a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in access to education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If students are to be kept hanging around for 3 months from March in a particular year this is hardly revolutionary access to education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill, together with complementary legislation, which gives assistance to students, is part of a conscious and deliberate policy of this Government to produce - these are the Minister’s words - a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> of access to education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As stated at the beginning of my remarks, the aim of this Government is to produce a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> of access to education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Holt  (Mr Oldmeadow)  claimed that the .Bill was designed to produce a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> of access to education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the kind of <span class="highlight">revolution</span> to which we direct attention and which is taking place under this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The tertiary education assistance scheme will start next year and, as the Minister for Education  (Mr Beazley)  has said, it is part of the Government’s <span class="highlight">revolution</span> of access to education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The notion that social levels should reflect differences in innate ability rather than differences in family was part of the democratic <span class="highlight">revolution</span> which accompanied industrialisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a gradualist society; it is not a revolutionary one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s proposals for a new health scheme are revolutionary; they are not evolutionary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the results of what happens in revolutionary societies one can imagine the confusion, the uncertainty and the problems that the Government scheme will create. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What their leaders are doing is trying to bring about what they call a revolutionary situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not wish to make out that the plans for <span class="highlight">revolution</span> have gone any further than in point of fact they have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first is this: The world food shortage it seems, is now becoming endemic since population apparently has overtaken the margin that was afforded us by the impact of the green <span class="highlight">revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, of course, would be subject to the good will of both sides, and that good will cannot be guaranteed if on the trade union side there are officials who are not trying to help their men, such as by getting them better conditions, but are trying to organise disruption as a plan for some kind of incipient <span class="highlight">revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They would all be revolutionaries as long as the <span class="highlight">revolution</span> is tomorrow week and not today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All our talk of millions of extra dollars should not be allowed to hide the fact that what we are really aiming at is a cultural, social and economic <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in our society with a new respect for the rights of every individual, not just an elite, to have the opportunity of living a personally satisfying life as a member of a genuinely democratic community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say again - I think it is worth repeating - that just prior to the regrettable <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in Chile about 750,000 workers rose in rebellion at one public meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is only one way that that ripple of insecurity, almost of <span class="highlight">revolution</span>, can be removed; this Government should go to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was no doubt in my mind, when I visited Redlynch, that this project was a complete <span class="highlight">revolution</span> and that it was a simple and most direct way of housing the people there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All this cannot be achieved overnight, but if the will and the unity of purpose can be found, Australia could witness a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in the development of this land that would make her one of the greatest nations on earth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does he consider that the electronics industry may have a special technological significance in the present industrial <span class="highlight">revolution</span> equal to that of steel in the first industrial <span class="highlight">revolution</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be, as the honourable member suggests, that electronics technology in this industrial <span class="highlight">revolution</span> is of equal importance to steel in the first indus’trial <span class="highlight">revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Regarding the ‘Marsellaise’, as has already been said, it arose from the circumstances of the French <span class="highlight">Revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Future historians will almost certainly view the weeks following 6 October 1973 as a period of extraordinary economic changes in the world - a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in fact heralding an awakening by some of the previously under-developed, under-privileged, have-not nations to the fact that they may after all be possessors of the world’s most sought after materials, these basic materials being essential to many of the affluent nations if they are to maintain their high standards of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, once the <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in wool marketing had started it was quickly realised that the concepts that were taught in the traditional wool classing courses were no longer relevant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although the situation on Zanzibar has been less dear, the present leadership there, as  President  Nyerere indicated during his visit, is seeking to counter the worst effects of a violent <span class="highlight">revolution</span> and reactions to years of abuse which stemmed from foreign domination including the slave traffic centred on the island of Zanzibar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I conclude my contribution to the Budget debate by saying that the Labor Government has created that serious economic crisis and that there are some people in the trade union movement with political beliefs of a communist philosophy who are exploiting it to the utmost to bring about that quiet <span class="highlight">revolution</span> and to destroy free enterprise in this country so that a climate is created where ALP socialism will be the only alternative because private enterprise will no longer be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This may have been the position for a number of years, particularly in regard to some of the dairy farms; but I think it can be said that there has been almost a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in pig production, particularly on a scientific basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like to draw the attention of the House to the comment of the great French philosopher, Voltaire, who, in 1764, at the time of the French <span class="highlight">Revolution</span> said: ‘I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As honourable members would know, this book readily became a capitalist declaration of independence from the remaining shackles of feudalism and helped to launch an economic <span class="highlight">revolution</span> that has produced far more wealth than man had amassed in all previous history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is probable that had there been no Teheran and Yalta compacts, western rather than eastern Europe would have become the theatre of <span class="highlight">revolution</span>- especially France and Italy, where the authority of the old ruling classes was in ruins, the working classes were in revolt, and the Communist parties led the bulk of the armed Resistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Industrial <span class="highlight">Revolution</span> in Britain finally forced upon that country, as it forced upon this country, many changes in the working of governmental institutions, including the courts and the law, in a period when the rates of change were shorter than we experience today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Port Jackson was an ideal, sheltered deep sea port and with the rapid expansion of railways- bearing in mind that this country was settled and developed after the Industrial <span class="highlight">Revolution</span>- Sydney became the hub of a quite sophisticated transport system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What the honourable gentleman was doing was putting into practice the thesis of the honourable member for Lalor  (Dr J. F. Cairns),  the quiet revolutionary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Opposition as Prime Minister was bent on carrying out the not so quiet <span class="highlight">revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Keynes brought about what is called the Keynesian <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in 1935 by pointing out that in that system the equilibrium of full employment was only an accidential equilibrium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So it may well be eventually in this country that if the conservative parties and the interests that they represent refuse the Opposition a fair chance to govern or to govern effectively then they may eventually find themselves witnessing, not reform, but <span class="highlight">revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Its rush into an allegedly idealistic international Third World of socialism was further marred by the obvious personal ambitions of its individual members to achieve economic and social <span class="highlight">revolution</span> while leaving their mark on the pages of Australian history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, it is the same baseless argument as was used against the introduction of machinery in the Industrial <span class="highlight">Revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I quote from a document titled  Communist Rules for <span class="highlight">Revolution</span>  which was written in 1919 and which lists the 4 basic rules as: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is the increase in population, which is driving the farmers to the more marginal lands and to the use of the green <span class="highlight">revolution</span> new grains which require more fertilisers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been an agricultural <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in this country by the addition of these fertilisers to the pastures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a matter of great regret to me personally as a person from the city, because it is only since the Industrial <span class="highlight">Revolution</span> that most of us have been in the cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That attitude, or that assertion, died soon after the industrial <span class="highlight">revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If honourable members want a comparison let me deal with Chile where the great <span class="highlight">revolution</span> took place and where the great copper mining industry of that nation was brought to its knees because suddenly the expertise disappeared, the incentive disappeared. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the biggest one in our area since the Industrial <span class="highlight">Revolution</span>, yet the Liberal and Country parties continue to talk as if cliches such as free enterprise, the judgment of the market place and less government will solve the problems; all this despite the lessons of history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Regrettably comments have been made from time to time by insignificant back benchers, also on the left wing of Australian politics, urging <span class="highlight">revolution</span> and urging people to take mass action when the parliamentary process did not come out as they expected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>

    <p>I say they are unpatriotic to the extent that they involve an attempt to break down the parliamentary system in this country and to replace it with street rabble <span class="highlight">revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Was he saying that between each 3- yearly democratic election we should gather in little groups or big groups, that we should go into the streets, that we should preach violence and <span class="highlight">revolution</span>, and that we should white-ant - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>If he does neither the judgment of Australia will be that the Australian Labor Party has as its  Deputy  Leader a man who would countenance mass action, physical violence, coming out in the streets and preaching <span class="highlight">revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not social <span class="highlight">revolution</span>, which the Opposition is so concerned about, but it is reform in a concerned way which has at its centre interest for people and the wellbeing of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think that people should lose sight of the fact that after promising a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> to restore the pride, confidence and strength of the Chinese empire, Chiang Kai-shek first turned the machine guns on the striking workers in Shanghai in the early 1920s- workers who had struck to facilitate his takeover of the country- then proceeded to collaborate with the very people who had been responsible for the destruction and subjection of China for so long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a vast potential for effect upon our economy and upon our whole system if the world economy changes to the extent that it could change if the monetary backing for international trading agreements becomes a gold-backed rouble rather that the British pound, or more recently the American dollar- the backing which has existed since the time of the Industrial <span class="highlight">Revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a sense the green <span class="highlight">revolution</span> was an achievement but there are many people today who look upon the green <span class="highlight">revolution</span> as being a disaster for although it did result in a much greater yield per acre for crops, at the same time it introduced into basic peasant societies expectation of technological innovation and, when added to the fact that they have already such a huge population which is underemployed, one must seriously question whether a high standard of technology is the answer to their difficulty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To allow to develop a situation in which we are vulnerable to <span class="highlight">revolution</span> and changes of government in other parts of the world or to an OPEC-type operation in relation to the price of rock phosphate could mean that Australian users of rock phosphate and, in turn, the farmers who use superphosphate and other phosphatic fertilisers will have to pay exorbitant prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have stated before that one of the good things about the Telecom Australia dispute was that it brought to the fore and to the notice of the public the fact that the second industrial <span class="highlight">revolution</span> was not around the corner but was upon us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This industrial <span class="highlight">revolution</span>, of course, was brought about by computerisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Did the Minister for Post and Telecommunications hear the radio program  AM  on 10 October in which it was reported that Peter McLullan, President of the Young Lawyers Association of Victoria, and Neil McLean, former national leader of the Australian student movement, broadcast from China to Thailand calling for continued communist <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in Thailand? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is generally believed now- I have seen no evidence to contradict this belief- that the tertiary sector is the sector which will feel the enormous impact of the technological <span class="highlight">revolution</span>, so we cannot expect it to take up the reduction in employment in the manufacturing sector that has applied hitherto. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This kind of adjustment has been going on since the Industrial <span class="highlight">Revolution</span>, and despite some recent hysteria there is no reason why we cannot sensibly agree on ways of sharing the work and the benefits of the particular kinds of technological advance available to us now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With that diminished capacity to predict future trends, the Government has just stumbled on the fact that Australia is on the verge of a technological <span class="highlight">revolution</span> which carries immense consequences for the manufacturing base in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781025_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As to what is happening today in South East Asia, the signatures on this document simply witness the fact that there are regimes which are endeavouring to hold back the course of social change and social <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is no way that the Government can sit back and blithely say that this post-industrial <span class="highlight">revolution</span>, this onset of advancing technology, can be likened to the industrial <span class="highlight">revolution</span> when initially the crofters smashed the machines which slowly created more employment for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781115_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one looks at the communes of China one will see that the <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in China was directly related to land reform in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781115_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it any wonder that if one does not look at the basic problem of land reform one will be virtually looking at the emergence of a revolutionary force based on the assumption that there must be a better way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781115_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Owing to the inability of the green <span class="highlight">revolution</span> to raise agricultural output at a faster rate than population output there will be a worsening food grain deficit in the whole region by 1985. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, the hope that the effects of the green <span class="highlight">revolution</span> and economic growth in the towns would percolate down to the poor now seems mistaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this view becomes general, the educational <span class="highlight">revolution</span> that matters will have been achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not so much a revival- this intense Islamic faith has always been there- as the use of the faith to ferment a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> which could well spread right through to our own shores. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is especially true in the period since 1971, the period since the microchip <span class="highlight">revolution</span>, where there is a complete break in relationship between the level of output which is able to rise exponentially while the employment and other significant inputs are able to fall exponentially. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One thing he proposed which did not get a lot of publicity, but which I now condemn as a recipe for <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in this country, and liable to bring down parliamentary democracy- I put it as high as that- was that income earners in this country should be taxed up to a maximum marginal tax rate of 80c in the dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
