<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that due to the <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in shipping, freights in this industry have grown until now the effective freight rate is likely to be of the order of $3.7 a bushel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-68">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the greatest tragedies is that a great nation like the United States of America has been able to move into other countries, particularly in South America, in order to create <span class="highlight">revolution</span>, the destruction of human beings and the assassination of persons who have been elected to leadership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When that occurs there will have to be some sort of <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in the organisation of non-Labor people in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the Departmental impasse over the future posting of Ambassador Booker, when will Ambassador-elect Barry Dexter be seen driving down the Boulevarde of the <span class="highlight">Revolution</span> in Belgrade? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this chamber recently there has been a quiet <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in relation to dress regulations led by my colleague  Senator McLaren. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Governor-General’s Speech, to which we are addressing ourselves at the moment, contains the continuation of an attempt by the Liberal and Country Party governments since 1949 and 1951 to complete the social <span class="highlight">revolution</span> which those governments embarked upon in 1949 and 1951. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Postmaster-General aware that, as a result of a so-called <span class="highlight">revolution</span> or battle for supremacy being waged within the Australian television industry amongst commercial television station licensees, literally millions of dollars are being spent abroad on the purchase of overseas programmes, most of which are being bought under package deal arrangements, much to the detriment of the development of Australian television dramatic and variety programmes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our view in relation to South East Asia has been that a social and economic <span class="highlight">revolution</span> is taking place there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in Asia was not Communist, but a resurgence of nationalism, the Governor General,  Sir Paul  Hasluck, said last night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Washington and Moscow were just beginning to realise that the <span class="highlight">revolution</span> was taking place, he said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether we should read George Orwell’s book on the Spanish <span class="highlight">Revolution</span> or whether we should read other books to the left or to the right of the views in that book, but we should have a 1 970 concept of democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A gathering is to be held by the national and Sydney committees of the Communist Parties of Australia in Jim Healey Hall for the launching of a booklet titled ‘Lenin Theories of <span class="highlight">Revolution</span>’ which is written by Eric Aarons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He took me back to the early days following the Russian <span class="highlight">Revolution</span> in 1917. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They must look with much foreboding for the future integrity of this country because what is taking place is sponsored by a power which is dedicated to world <span class="highlight">revolution</span> and of taking over as many countries as possible by force of arms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember reading after the French <span class="highlight">revolution</span>– <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember reading after the French <span class="highlight">Revolution</span> that in spite of the awful poverty that prevailed in France, the world was astonished that everywhere the lean, gaunt, hungry legions of the French, often poorly equipped and trained, flung back the enemy that was trying to invade their country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new technique of containerisation of cargoes could properly be described as a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> which may have a greater impact, on Tasmania than on any other part of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The introduction of a container service is a major shipping <span class="highlight">revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in shipping of a very dramatic character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the  experiences drawn from  the  Vietnamese <span class="highlight">revolution</span> have demonstrated  the  correctness  of the  Marxist-Leninist theory of violent <span class="highlight">revolution</span> and have rejected  all  illusions about peaceful transition- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aim of the present <span class="highlight">revolution</span> is that the entire people should thoroughly absorb the Socialist ideology, that this should abandon their previous outlooks on life and on the world and replace it with the Marxist viewpoint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment - I now come to the point raised by  Senator Webster  by way of interjection - there is supposed to be a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> going on in television in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Bruce  Gyngell, a senior executive with Channel 7 in Sydney, and who was with Channel 9 at one time, has been engaging himself and the station for which he works in what is known as a television <span class="highlight">revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a complete <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in what is called the feature film. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that it has considerable depth because it is now a very prominent feature of developing countries that, with the green <span class="highlight">revolution</span> and the selfsufficiency now being striven for and obtained in many countries, there is not the demand for our primary products that we were expecting or hoping for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the last 2 or 3 years there has been  a  <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in thinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>war or <span class="highlight">revolution</span> or civil disturbance in the buyer’s country; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking on this subject on 1st and 2nd November 1967, again in the dying stages of a session, when a Bill to increase the amounts payable was introduced, I traced the history of workers compensation from the Industrial <span class="highlight">Revolution</span> in England to that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not prepared to bring today’s payment up to what was won by struggle in Great Britain in the early days of the Industrial <span class="highlight">Revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The strength and security of the family unit is perhaps the basic reason why we have, to this stage of our political history, arrived by evolution and not by <span class="highlight">revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not suggested that  Mr Gregory  will start a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there is a paragraph headed ‘Calculated <span class="highlight">Revolution</span>’ in which the following appears: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But revolutionary action does not require an army of support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spontaneous reaction involves larger numbers of people than calculated <span class="highlight">revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As always happens after a natural disaster, the National Guard comes in abd cleans up the disaster area, but six skilled revolutionaries  can control the destructive  natural forces as scientists attempt to do with the weather. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the National Guard pulls into an area, the revolutionaries will pull out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So he goes on with his plans for that kind of <span class="highlight">revolution</span> of which we have heard so much from other people, people who had used that means to take over a number of free countries of the world - Czechoslovakia and the rest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is a man who has written books in which he has preached what is involved in <span class="highlight">revolution</span>, although he calls himself non-violent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does it not realise, and does not the Government realise, that in the United States and elsewhere the casette <span class="highlight">revolution</span> is now well under way? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701014_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the great social <span class="highlight">revolution</span> that the last 20 years has seen developed in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701016_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, I point out to the Government that at the present time there is what might be known as a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> - a cassette or cartridge <span class="highlight">revolution</span> - taking place particularly in the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throughout the world today, as 1 have mentioned previously, what is known as the cassette <span class="highlight">revolution</span> is taking place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be a real <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in its effect on feature film production and the television industry, lt will have a tremendous impact on the entertainment habits of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are already faced with the terrible collapse of markets due to increased competition from synthetic fibres, to the glut of wheat following the green <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in Asia, and to the protectionist move of Great Britain in joining the European Common Market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Communist China has repeatedly asserted the need for the overthrow of established states by <span class="highlight">revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The universal validity of the Chinese pattern of <span class="highlight">revolution</span> is proclaimed and is seen to be especially relevant for the predominantly agrarian underdeveloped world, including South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chinese support for <span class="highlight">revolution</span> and insurgency is not only ideological but is also practical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is broadcasting hostile propaganda calling for <span class="highlight">revolution</span> and is encouraging subversion and insurgency in Malaysia and Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of India it has called for <span class="highlight">revolution</span> and it has lent active support to the Naga rebels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should remember, too, that there is no real equivalent of our Parliament in China and that the institutions of the People’s Republic are in a state of disarray after the cultural <span class="highlight">revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that Red China and South East Asia have been caught up in what has been termed the green <span class="highlight">revolution</span>’ in South East Asia inasmuch as the people of those regions are probably growing more food and, incidentally, more rice, now than ever before in their history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a coup occurs in a country and there is a change of government, perhaps by <span class="highlight">revolution</span>, generally the great powers of the world recognise the incoming government because it is in complete control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Something which the western mind cannot grasp is called the ‘cultural <span class="highlight">revolution</span>’ where young people were allowed to demonstrate on the streets but China found it had created a Frankenstein monster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now we receive reports that the damage done by the cultural <span class="highlight">revolution</span> probably was not as great as was at first thought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when the Minister in charge of the debate on this urgency proposal enunciated the Government’s policy he accused the People’s Republic of China of wanting to create <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in practically every country in Asia right around to India. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that she has not been playing the game, but that she has been trying to create <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in every country in Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>In 1972 the present  Deputy  Prime Minister,  Dr J.  F. Cairns, wrote in a book called ‘The Quiet <span class="highlight">Revolution</span>’: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dr Cairns  said that if there is to be a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in an advanced capitalist system it is essential to have an economic crisis, and that is where we are going. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Make no mistake about it; it does not matter what Government is in power, we cannot have a repetition of what happened earlier in history when the Luddites introduced a new form of industrial <span class="highlight">revolution</span> by going around smashing all the wheels and rollers in machinery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given the constraints of a political democracy, inflation, according to Galbraith ‘s diagnosis, is unlikely to disappear until an intellectual <span class="highlight">revolution</span> has developed into a common consensus, until a new conventional wisdom more attuned to the realities it seeks to interpret has replaced the old. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately, there is little sign that such an intellectual <span class="highlight">revolution</span> has become a common consensus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Amidst all this talk of a rural <span class="highlight">revolution</span> or attempts to incite a rural <span class="highlight">revolution</span> it is interesting to look back a few years to when net farm income averaged about $3,500. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The distinction between a real economic crisis which existed in respect of agriculture in 1970-71 and a fantasy economic crisis which exists today and between the reactions to the two can be explained by the fact that current so-called attempts to incite a rural <span class="highlight">revolution</span> are politically motivated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are not inciting <span class="highlight">revolution</span>; we are looking for democracy in this country because we are one of the few democratic nations left in a world that is torn with strife at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To achieve this <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in the scope, attitudes and, importantly, the membership of the PAC may well require a fundamental break from the past and a rethinking of the parliamentary review mechanism from the base up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There cannot be a consensus of view over many important matters but there must be an acceptance on the part of members on each side of the Parliament that in due course they will cease to form the Government, that there will be no <span class="highlight">revolution</span>, that they will step out and someone will replace them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It appears that in recent times- by recent times’ I mean, say, since about the time of the discovery of Australia- there have been 3 huge revolutionary movements in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first was connected with the French and American revolutions which sought to throw off autocratic and aristocratic government and to replace it with what might be called minimal government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this century there has been another huge revolutionary movement- the Russian and Chinese revolutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The British <span class="highlight">revolution</span> started just before the turn of the century with the formation of the Fabian Society in London. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we look at all these <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in historical perspective, we can see the Hegelian dialectic in operation: The first <span class="highlight">revolution</span> bringing about the minimal state, the second <span class="highlight">revolution</span> bringing about the total state and in the synthesis between the two one can see the welfare state of Great Britain coming about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The worldwide British <span class="highlight">revolution</span> really got under way in 1947 when the socialist British Government gave independence to the socialist Indian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fundamental fact is that it is precipitating a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> and honourable senators opposite have not addressed themselves to the solution of this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The nitrogenous deficiency in Australian soils has been overcome to a large extent by the pasture <span class="highlight">revolution</span> of the 1950s in which leguminous crops and pasture species were seen to restore the nitrogen balance of soils following years of cropping and/or grazing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Remorselessly these events, which had been set in train by both the communist <span class="highlight">revolution</span> and takeover of the armed forces in Portugal and the flow of arms into East Timor by the then revolutionary government in East Timor, led to a situation where there seemed to be no possibility of their being halted by the Australian Government at the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is agreed that the compression in the number of operatives at the port of Mackay is indicative of this virtually quiet industrial <span class="highlight">revolution</span> which has occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first step would be to restrict the generation of power to essential services and to cut it off altogether if the mutineers sought to use that power for purposes to assist the <span class="highlight">revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps as  Mr Bond  suggested the United States, which we will all remember was itself born as a nation out of <span class="highlight">revolution</span> and defiance of the British Crown, would welcome these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even if  Sir Charles  has lapsed I am supremely confident that other loyalist zealots in the hydra-headed Australian League of Rights will vociferously demand that these potential fomentors of <span class="highlight">revolution</span> be rigorously excluded from this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a sad feeling that I and any honourable senator sitting in this House who derives paternally from Great Britain have when I see that the country which led the industrial <span class="highlight">revolution</span> is now in its present state simply because of the besotted pursuit of a socialist objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer the Senate to the excellent summary by the honourable member for Franklin  (Mr Goodluck)  in the debate in the other place of the chronological history of the apprenticeship movement from the year 2100 BC, through the years of the Industrial <span class="highlight">Revolution</span> in England, to the present in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There had to be mistakes in what was a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in education and a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in expenditure over those 3 years- over those two eighteen-month terms of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fission energy is safe only if a number of critical devices work as they should, if a number of people in key positions follow all their instructions, if there is no sabotage, no hijacking of transports, if no reactor fuel processing plant or waste repository anywhere is situated in a region of riots or guerrilla activity and no <span class="highlight">revolution</span> or war- even a ‘conventional one’- takes place in these regions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They might also consider that the time is not ripe at the moment for <span class="highlight">revolution</span>; that we are now in a trough and the wave will come when they will provide more support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is therefore clear that the only solution of this problem is a new  proletarisation  of this workers’  aristrocracy  because it is impossible to achieve a successful <span class="highlight">revolution</span> without a proletariat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mrs Han  Suyin writes articles one day saying how Madam Chiang Ching is bringing about a new type of socialism and democracy because she is a guide of the cultural <span class="highlight">revolution</span> and then a week later she writes in  Scope  that this is in fact not the case and that Madam Chiang Ching and 3 others were all members of the Gang of Four who were plotting to restore capitalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the great publicised activities of aid and development in agriculture in underdeveloped countries in recent years has been the socalled green <span class="highlight">revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any person who studies what has happened in those countries as a result of the implementation of the green <span class="highlight">revolution</span> will realise that the lifestyle and the agricultural economy of those countries have been upset. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So the withdrawal of the Portuguese and the <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in their own country as well as in Timor was part of the context of the problem as far back as September 1944. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this matter is carried beyond the point it has now reached it is my fear that it will do no good to those people directly involved as the problems of war and <span class="highlight">revolution</span> occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, the other factor which has to be borne in mind is the sort of <span class="highlight">revolution</span> of rising expectations which has flooded Australian universities in the last decade and left technical institutions in the Cinderella situation- again as the poor relation of universities and, lately, as the poor relation of colleges of advanced education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ever since the issue of Timor became relevant to Australia, that is, since the colonial administration began to break down following the <span class="highlight">revolution</span> that took place in Portugal, there has been a growing interest in this issue and in the right of the Timorese people to self-determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Their thinking was that the purpose of civilised democratic constitutional government in countries such as Britain was to carry on the traditions which had been established by the glorious Whig <span class="highlight">revolution</span> of 1688, to take by gradual constitutional means with the consent of the electors steps towards a state of society in which, whether the means of production were publicly or privately owned, at least there was, as far as one could possibly achieve these means by legislative action, equality of opportunity amongst all of the people to live in England, which was the country with which they were dealing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am reminded that in 1 802, early in the industrial <span class="highlight">revolution</span>, a book entitled  Cotton is King  was written. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some people are crying havoc at the prospects of the technological <span class="highlight">revolution</span>- computer technology and so on- a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> which undoubtedly already has had a marked impact on the manufacturing sector and is now having the same effect in the information processing area, particularly in the automation of routine clerical and typing operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With all the rabid proselytisers of free enterprise who seem to populate the Liberal Party of Western Australia, I am surprised that there was not a palace <span class="highlight">revolution</span> when  Sir Charles  Court nationalised the Midland Railway Co. in the mid-1960s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Press was equally happy about the way in which the Senate Estimates Committees were operating and an article headed ‘<span class="highlight">Revolution</span> in the Senate ‘ in the Melbourne  Sunday Observer  of 25 October 1970 made the following comment: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further, even though many penalty rates were consent awards, would the Minister not agree that the demands of the current technological <span class="highlight">revolution</span> make their contribution to productivity and employment a negative one? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was the natural forces in the market place that eventually placed vast areas of Chinese property- virtually all Chinese property- in the hands of two related families, the Chiangs and the Soongs, and created the strains that led to the success of the communist <span class="highlight">revolution</span> late in 1949. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is pretty plain that we are not going to do very well just pursuing the old paths, especially in competition with the very energetic Asian industrial <span class="highlight">revolution</span> that is going on in such places as South Korea, Taiwan and, of course, China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second area of concern is that not only is Japan facing a major industrial change by automating its factories, it is also facing a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> on the world’s markets because its cost structures have risen significantly above those of countries such as Korea and Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the first break in this respect- it is relevant to the struggles that are engulfing our region at the moment- took place during the Russian <span class="highlight">revolution</span> of 1917. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Time does not permit me to deal with every other incident that has taken place in foreign affairs since then, but a somewhat similar situation developed in the Chinese <span class="highlight">revolution</span>, which was consummated in 1949 when the Chinese people liberated their country from the forces of Chiang Kai-shek, who had at certain stages of that country’s history collaborated with the Japanese in defence of the feudal system that operated there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We did not even have an inkling of recent events in Iran, although I note that  Senator Kilgariff  claimed in his speech that when he was in Iran last year he felt that that country was on the brink of <span class="highlight">revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One thing that emerged from that <span class="highlight">revolution</span> was the cancellation of armament contracts with United States, France and the United Kingdom worth billions of dollars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The claim by China that Chinese nationals were being persecuted arose from this incident and it seems to me peculiar that China should accuse Vietnam of something which it did itself after the <span class="highlight">revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe the fact that we rarely do so and the fact that even the media in this country rarely discuss foreign affairs, except on spectacular occasions of war and <span class="highlight">revolution</span>, is regrettable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One recalls the statement made by Alexander Solzhenitsyn that ‘in our country since the <span class="highlight">revolution</span> there has never been such a thing as a free trade union’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, now the situation has changed quite rapidly, not only with the creation of specialist tribunals such as the Social Security Appeals Tribunals, for one, but also with the enactment of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 and the supporting array of legislation, in particular the Ombudsman Act 1976 and the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act of 1 977, which, at least when they all come into full operation, will create a situation of real <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in our administrative law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the other hand, it will cause concern to those who would attempt to overthrow us and our way of life by <span class="highlight">revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If that is the case we must have a very poor intelligence organisation because I cannot recall the last time anybody was arrested in this country for trying to overthrow the Government by violent <span class="highlight">revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point that I am making is this: If the word ultimately’ stays in the Bill then we have caught up as potentially subversive- therefore subject to all the powers that are vested in the Organisation by this Act- all those rather pathetic little splinter groups particularly of the far Left which engage in most cases more out of a sense of duty rather than any real belief in fuzzy, millenarian rhetoric about the ultimate <span class="highlight">revolution</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make this point particularly in the light of the sorts of contributions we had from  Senator Lewis  and others of his kind during the second reading debate in which he asserted, as a matter of obvious and uncontested reality, that revolutionary groups which were scattered around the Australian political landscape were quite properly the subject matter of Australian Security Intelligence Organization surveillance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The particular revolutionary groups  Mr Justice  Hope adverted to quite specifically in his report as having in their political platforms quite explicit revolutionary aspirations, were the Communist Party, the Socialist Party of Australia and the Communist Party of Australia Marxist-Leninist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, the third body that attracts  Mr Justice  Hope’s explicit attention, at page 48 of the report in question, is the CPA(M/L), the China-line communist party which recently, of course, found itself split into two rather bitterly-opposed factions, with its barely 1,000 members divided between those who pledge undying loyalty to the Gang of Four and the Cultural <span class="highlight">Revolution</span> and those- the larger group- who support the current more pragmatically-inclined Chinese leadership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly Chinese foreign policy in the post-Mao period would hardly encourage wild schemes of <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He indicated that the reports that 2 1 more executions took place on 8 May brought the total executions since the <span class="highlight">revolution</span> to almost 200, a matter, I think, that all would deplore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the need for Australia to maintain its position with respect to research and development in the face of international competition at a time when we are on the verge of a technological <span class="highlight">revolution</span>, will the Minister exert his influence on the Government to review this policy with the objective of substantially increasing Government funding and incentives to industry, et cetera, in order to step up our research capacity, which I regard as very critical to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By a curious coincidence- it is funny how antiSemites seem to say exactly the same thing from whichever direction they come- the Australian League of Rights was circulating at the same time a document in which it said that this apparently very versatile banking firm of Kuhn, Loeb and Co. financed the Russian <span class="highlight">Revolution</span> in 1917! <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
