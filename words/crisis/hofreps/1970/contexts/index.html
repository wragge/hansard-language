<ul>

    <p>Is it a fact that there is a growing <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in education in South Australia, particularly at the primary and secondary levels, and that the State is unable to meet pressing demands in the areas of building, transport, teacher training, administrative costs and salaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-33-5">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Noone in this Parliament, no-one in Australia and certainly no wheat grower will be satisfied with the attempt of the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  to downgrade the importance of the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the Australian-Chinese wheat trade and, generally, in trade relations between Australia and China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to the Minister for the Navy that what he has said is nonsense because as most honourable members well know, the place of the Minister for Primary Industry at the present time is in Australia, in this Parliament and particularly at the helm in the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> we are facing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is is a fact that, due to the great increase in the number of unemployed, benefit payments have been delayed because of the failure to increase the staff of his Department to meet this <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720411_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-34-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>

    <p>Has his attention been drawn to statements by the Annual Conference of the Australian Automobile Chamber of Commerce that Australia has reached a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> point in worn tyre disposals and that motorists will be expected to pay for tyre disposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-52-6">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact, as stated by the  President  of the Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association of Western Australia, that private nursing homes in Western Australia will face a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> early in 1974; if not, what is the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-22">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why, in the latter part of last year and in the early part of this year, did the Government permit the Reserve Bank to allow the trading banks to move into speculative investment loans whereby a liquidity <span class="highlight">crisis</span> arose only to be covered by certificates of deposit at high rates of interest? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the matters that I propose in this motion are relevant to our main responsibilities as members of Parliament and we would be recreant to those responsibilites if we did not consider them in the present frightening state of <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a brief preamble I point out that although 2 questions concerning the beef industry were asked yesterday of the Minister for Northern Development, I regard the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the industry today to be of such a magnitude that I would expect the Minister and his colleagues to have made important decisions within the last 24 hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for Education: Has the pattern of grants for education by the Australian Government produced the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in education in New South Wales alleged by the New South Wales Minister for Education,  Sir Eric  Willis, or is this another attempt by a State Minister to blame the inadequacies of his administration upon the Australian Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More than at any time, I believe, since Federation Australia needs to re-examine and learn the lessons of the constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of 1975 and to make sure that that dark day- 11 November- is never repeated in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I recognise that the Minister has his warm supporters, but despite them the rank and file of the people of Jerilderie would have preferred a visit from the other historic character who rode into the town some years before and who at a time of <span class="highlight">crisis</span> did something positive by burning up all the mortgages he found in the Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  President  of a Riverina graziers organisation, who is hardly a roaring radical but is a gentleman of great substance and standing whom I respect, told the meeting that the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the countryside was an immediate problem for the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  President  of the United Farmers and Woolgrowers Association of New South Wales put his finger on wool as one of the keys to the rural <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at this business of whether there is validity in our submission today, which was put so well by the honourable member for Dawson  (Dr Patterson),  that there is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the countryside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Primary Industry went to one of those meetings, I might add, and probably had something to say about the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in addition to what he said today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The burden of their message was that they were in trouble; that there was a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and that it had to be tackled by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in rural industry about which we are talking there was not a hint in the Governor-General’s Speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government says there is no <span class="highlight">crisis</span> anywhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there a denial today by the Minister that in fact there is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite all the activity by the Government in the past 20 years, we face this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me just cite one town as an example of the situation and of this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which is real and cannot be denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a town in which every business house and the co-operative gathered together and announced in the local Press that all credit had finished, that it had ended, that it had to be cash or nothing because of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> confronting primary industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They demand action because there is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in primary industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The greatest danger at the present time is that because of the growing economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in major sectors of primary industry, to quote the words of the matter raised for discussion in this debute, hasty, ill-considered policies will be proposed designed merely to take the heat off temporarily rather than to attack the real cause of the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr McEwen)  and the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Anthony),  along with Government members, have been giving this important problem considerable attention with wool industry leaders, and every effort is being made to solve the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which has arisen in the wool industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If there is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> today in industrial democracy it stems, as  Sir Isaiah  Berlin suggested in a rare interview, from:   . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Essentially, what has been created is a phony <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Except in terms of the internal affairs of the Liberal Party, there is no CommonwealthState <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in school finance; there is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in hospitals finance; there is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in city finance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have complimented him on numerous occasions and I believe that when the history of this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is written he will stand high in the minds of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that the Government has failed to warn the wheat growers, the public and the taxpayers in sufficient time of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that has arisen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The criticism that the Opposition levies at the Government is that it did not face up to its responsibilities at least S years ago when the Treasury publicly, together with international agencies, warned that the wheat industry was heading for a <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Plans should have been made when the Wheat Industry Stabilisation Bill was introduced into the Parliament 2 years ago to solve the problem, but it was not until April of last year that any official statement was made about the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the wheat industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we now face a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in primary industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, as I say, is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Government has not only failed the nation in the important areas I have mentioned; it has also been responsible for the development of the worst <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the rural sector of this nation for more than 30 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the greatest problem facing the nation today is the rising cost squeeze, not only upon the rural industries - it has reached <span class="highlight">crisis</span> proportions there, we know - but upon practically all of our export earning industries as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The truth of the matter is that Australian farmers are generally efficient by world standards, but they are being burdened by cost pressures which have, in many cases, brought them to <span class="highlight">crisis</span> point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">crisis</span> point has been reached in the wool industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish the Parliament would set to and do some homework on it or establish a select committee to examine how we can develop the civilian defence capacity of Australia with its tremendous resources in every town, in workshops, in naval yards and so on, into a viable defence capacity which does not waste people’s time but which still can be an effective mobilisation point for the nation if ever we come to a point of <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The argument may well be raised that the Western Australian State Government recently took from its housing allocation some $2m for the purposes of education; but this only emphasises the inadequacies which exist in Commonwealth-State relationships, for a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> situation has been created in the provision of education facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In time of family <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, faced with the worry of sudden illness or injury, they face the added burden of knowing that they must encounter a long trip to a city hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ran into some trouble in 1961 through applying the brakes too hard but I remind the honourable member for Lalor, who was critical of the Government’s handling of economics and finance, that no less an authority than the ‘London Financial Times’ praised Australia for the way it handled its financial <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We accept that there is a potential <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and that a lot of damage could be caused to pearl beds and marine life if action were not taken now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the last time that the Government initiated such a debate despite the fact that its supporters who have poultry farmers in their electorates know full well the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> being engendered in that industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After that Bill this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> developed in the wheat industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way that we could debate wheat quotas and the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the industry was by taking the opportunity afforded by Grievance Day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is significant that we have had no debate this year on the wheat industry <span class="highlight">crisis</span> itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He made very clear what he thought of the Minister for Primary Industry and the Government with respect to the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the wheat industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Almost every day we read in the newspapers of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and the unrest in the wool industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both the Parliament and the Australian primary producers have been treated with the utmost contempt by the Australian Government, because despite the growing financial <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the primary industries the Government refuses to exercise even the slightest semblance of leadership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party is aware that this <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, this chaos, this law of the jungle, this exploitation of the many by the few can and must be solved by planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did he receive reports from the Minister for Defence before he left us and the Minister for the Interior following their promise to 10,000 farmers, who marched in Melbourne to protest against the continuing <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the countryside, that they would convey to the Prime Minister without delay the farmers’ protest and their request for action? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700408_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, there was the matter of the Commonwealth Public Service, its pay and conditions; secondly, the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in primary industry; thirdly, the malnutrition among Aboriginals exposed by the Australian Medical Journal; fourthly, the rising interest rates as they affect home builders in particular; fifthly, the denial and delay of entry permits for New Guinea academics - and this is still continuing today, as we found out during question time; sixthly, the rise in urban land prices; and finally, the rein traduction of a waiting period for war service homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There we find that at this late stage, when things had reached a state of <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, the Liberal Party in Western Australia - at least the Young Liberal Party as can be seen from that article - has seen the need to look for a policy, to begin developing a policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think here we see cause to condemn the Liberal Party and to condemn this Government, because the Party has admitted tacitly that it has failed to produce a policy and that it had not grasped the position until the position had reached <span class="highlight">crisis</span> point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to take down into my electorate members of my Party so that they can see the conditions that exist, the conditions that have caused members of the Liberal Party to realise that there is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The meetings were held because of the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Money, money, money, money; that is all one hears when the hospital <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in Australia is discussed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not suggesting that there is no <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course there is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not that doctors are extravagant or that hospitals are inefficient; the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> has come about because patients or potential patients, such as other honourable members and I. are demanding increased standards of medical care, particularly in the public hospital sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Briefly, I suggest that this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> could be minimised if the Government recognised that the present financial arrangements are extremely wasteful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Oxley claimed that the real <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in our hospitals is in the field of maintenance costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the 2nd of this month the ‘Age’ reported: ‘Hospital <span class="highlight">Crisis</span>; Patients Sent Away.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Minister says it is not a <span class="highlight">criSiS</span>, that things are all hunky-dory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This increased interest burden has snowballed into increased land costs and the increased cost of housing to such an extent that a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> has developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without, at this stage, going into the reasons why this does result directly from the land <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, I would merely indicate how bad the situation is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we recognise how basic the land prices <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is to the problem, this question follows: Could we use these funds in some other way to solve the problem of land prices? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, at the centre of this problem is the whole <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in relations between the Commonwealth Government and State and local governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a general lack of awareness that a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> exists in this field, but the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> will continue to exist so long as governments determinedly and successfully close their eyes to the ever widening gap between the deaf and society generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the subject of enormous controversy and of a major political <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in the electorate of the honourable member for Moore  (Mr Maisey)  2% of land on an average - if the Commonwealth average applies there - changed hands each year before the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is illustrated by the mounting <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which is spreading throughout rural Australia arid is characterised by organised marches and protest meetings of farmers and rural workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course we must welcome any small recognition by the Government of the current <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the countryside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was saying to the House just prior to the suspension of the sitting that most of the primary producers in the State of New South Wales, and in other States for that matter, are standing firm in the face of rising costs and in the face of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the countryside at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Rural <span class="highlight">Crisis</span> Manifesto was produced by the Edenhope Agricultural Bureau. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Rural <span class="highlight">Crisis</span> Manifesto said this: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we have a situation of <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in which the same hot money is standing by to buy up properties of family enterprises which, as has been conceded by honourable members on both sides of the House today, have the record of being the most effective and efficient in absolute terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>MrGRASSBY- Perhaps I should be grateful to the honourable member for Evans for that interjection, because it seems to me that the entitre <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the countryside is either being deliberately misunderstood by some city interests or perhaps is misunderstood because of ignorance of the significance of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  last policy was taken out before the drought - before the current <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that, in considering such measures as this, we have forgotten that the drought faced producers with the worst <span class="highlight">crisis</span> for 100 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is the summation of what I have said tonight: That the family enterprise has been demonstrated to be both efficient and effective and is the backbone of the rural development of the nation; that the current <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is a product of policies or the absence of policies; that imposts, such as estate duty, must be totally reconstructed; that this small measure should be only a prelude to this being done as a matter of urgency; and that the vote on the amendment that has been put forward should be a vote of conscience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Riverina went on to illustrate the position of a family enterprise which as a result of this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> - and 1 presume he is talking about the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> we have heard him to be so vocal about in recent times - sees the end of an occupancy of a farm after 5 generations of, I presume, ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">crisis</span> facing Tasmania goes beyond defective services and uncompetitive freight rates; in the broader sense it strikes directly at the policies of decentralisation which have been vaunted by the Federal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The most unfortunate effect of the shipping <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is the loss of key industries to other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is blotting out the work which has been done over many years by way of incentive schemes to develop industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The shortage of nursing staff in public hospitals has reached <span class="highlight">crisis</span> point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>ls it a fact that there is a growing <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in education in South Australia, particularly at the primary and secondary levels, and that the State is unable to meet pressing demands in the areas of building, transport, teacher training, administrative costs and salaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here we have an industry with a combined capital investment of $8,000m with a chronic <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Undoubtedly contributing to the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is the fact that the auction system, so long a sacred procedure for many, is the middle man’s market and the grower and the user never meet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of vital importance is the attitude of the Government at this time of <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One would have thought that at some time in this debate tonight we would have at least had some discussion on the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in primary industry and the steps which this Government intends to take in the future to alleviate the problems, but all that we have heard about, as has been usual in the last few weeks, is buck passing and waiting until the industries of Australia come to this Government with some plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He did not devote any part of his speech to the call made by the Foreign Minister of Indonesia,  Mr Malik,  for an international conference - a conference which will deal not only with Vietnam but the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which has developed in Cambodia as well, a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which has extended this conflict to the whole of Indo China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps if there had been proper representation at that critical time we might have been able to have avoided the development of the Cambodian <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those honourable members should not apologise to me for being intemperate but they ought to apologise to the country people for not taking notice of their needs and not doing something about the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> as it is at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is where I return to the responsibility of this country to build and maintain necessary bases if we expect - and in fact we would expect - the British and others to be with us in any time of <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we have to face some kind of <span class="highlight">crisis</span> then what sort Qf reserves do we have? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should there be for some reason or other an unusual withdrawal rather than a reinvestment of dividends - about half of them are reinvested; it is a very high proportion - should there be a reduction of capital inflow because of the economic conditions in some other country that are not the same as they are here; and should there be a capital withdrawal, Australia would face a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> greater and more serious than any <span class="highlight">crisis</span> it has faced in its history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must look at what would occur if there was a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and a sudden demand for the repatriation of profits which have been capitalised in this country by being allowed to remain here or, alternatively, the repatriation of capital which had previously been borrowed from overseas and sent to this country, lt could be any type of <span class="highlight">crisis</span> - a political <span class="highlight">crisis</span> or a severe <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in Papua and New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difference could be accounted for to some extent by the different closing dates of the books of the various companies; but there is no doubt that if a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> did occur and the Government, irrespective of its political colour, had to make a sudden decision as to how to overcome the <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, there could not be a ready assessment of the extent and potential in the repatriation of overseas capital and profits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Otherwise, in the event of a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> we could be placed in a very difficult position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main  speaker,  and the main attraction for people who will be attending the Conference, will undoubtedly be  Dr Ernest  Mandel, a Belgian economist who, if he is allowed to enter Australia, will be speaking at the conference on the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of capitalist relations of production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister whether he will invite a representative from that un on to attend any further conferences on this <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ministry what is happening, because it is quite obvious from the way in which they talk that they do not know - and they certainly do not know in relation to this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that is before us today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are evident today world-wide classical symptoms of an economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This hill-billy government with its hill-billy economics is more ill equipped to face a major <span class="highlight">crisis</span> than any former Australian administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any event, the Government seems’ cavalierly unmoved by this phenomenally high rate of attrition at a time of developing <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in Australia’s nursing services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the appeal is ignored not only will the nursing profession experience a rapid movement into <span class="highlight">crisis</span> but so, too, will our public hospital system, currently serving the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might be better described as the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in nursing throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, before he would even discuss anything with this deputation he insisted that the industrial officer of the Royal Australian Nursing Federation make an apology for a public statement that he had made that the Minister was not really concerned with the nursing <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, in fact, the Minister in South Australia was more concerned with his own personal feelings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a great <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in staffing in public hospitals throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to conclude by saying that the nursing <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in our hospitals will not be solved until our attitudes to all aspects of nursing are revised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it had we would not have reached this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker, since this Parliament reassembled, debate and counter debate have taken place with regard to the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> facing primary industry in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, discussion of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> was promoted by the Opposition as a mater of public importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These figures highlight in the most dramatic way the startling <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that has developed in this industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the Administrative College in which over half of its staff is about to resign seems due to the application of an Australian perspective to the role of a public servant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no <span class="highlight">crisis</span> on this occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree that this sum of $US41m should be contributed so as to make these greater reserves available but at the same time we should have taken the opportunity to look at the whole problem of international liquidity and to ensure that Australia makes its proper contributions in the councils of the world to make sure the world does not proceed on an ad hoc basis from one <span class="highlight">crisis</span> to another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The linking of the railway line to the Eyre Peninsula will assist that area, which at the present time is going through a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> because of the wheat position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the provision of this money is not in itself sufficient because there seems to be plenty of evidence to clearly indicate that despite the fact that this money will be made available and the States will make good use of it, there is still a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although this Bill will help in some way, the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is getting worse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What should be done now to combat the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> caused by teachers leaving the profession? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this case we applaud this Bill, but the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is still there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without directly talking about State aid, problems nevertheless exist in nongovernment schools; in fact, there is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> there also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth’s help is commendable because there is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be borne in mind that if there were not a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> the Commonwealth would not be helping at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Commonwealth should not think that because it has given some help the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is being solved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">crisis</span> will get worse because insufficient money has been given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is obviously a very great need for increased teacher college accommodation in Victoria, because that State is passing through its worst <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in relation to the provision of teaching staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was in the Melbourne ‘Age’ on 21st May a report from the Victorian Teachers Union which showed just how severe this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> would become by the 1970s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to measure the Bill’s provisions against some of the aspects of the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span> position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking at the quantitative aspects, we have to remind ourselves that there is a very observable <span class="highlight">crisis</span> - the shortage of teachers of all kinds in both State and nonState schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My worry is that the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> conditions in the supply of teachers at the moment are such that I would have rather seen a much more systematic study of what was required and then an indication placed before this Parliament of what the dimensions of the problem are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Mallee and the honourable member for Diamond Valley  (Mr Brown),  who seems to be the prince of complacency in this place when it comes to any matter of consideration, ought to examine whether these meagre amounts and this meagre approach by the Commonwealth will solve the education <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the Government honestly neutral in the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the Middle East  or is it  giving a measure of support to the Arab nations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they do not take part in it, what the Minister himself called a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> situation when he was speaking to the Victorian Dairyfarmers Association on 26th May this year will not be overcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I was saying was that in view of the fact that there has already been a softening of the Government’s attitude in relation to the payments that are to be made for the 1969-70 season - and whether it is to be 20% or 40% I am not clear and I ask the Minister in all sincerity to clarify that point - would it not be reasonable, in view of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the countryside, to use the credit which the Treasurer has made available to him to pay the $1.10 on the 1969-70 pool and start off afresh? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I am stirred to rise in this debate because of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the wheat industry caused by the extraordinary, strange and outrageous policies of the present Liberal-Country Party Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Government was unprepared for the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that occurred in the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the Minister for primary Industry  (Mr Anthony)  to describe the present proposal of restricted deliveries to (he Australian Wheat Board as ‘positive remedial action’, and this reaction as ‘courageous and responsible’ is an assessment of the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which must surely go down in the varied and changing history of this industry as the greatest piece of selfdeception ever perpetrated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To increase the base price of wheat by the equivalent of US19c per bushel in the light of the then global stock position and crop prospects was an act of irresponsibility equalled only by the refusal of the governments, Federal and State, to come to grips with the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> now facing the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not hard to understand how the proposal to deal with the mounting <span class="highlight">crisis</span> offered 100% protection to only one group - the State handling authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was the situation when the Minister invited the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation to submit a proposal to cope with the pending <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet it not only receives a quota based on the best years of its performance out of which this over-production <span class="highlight">crisis</span> grew, hut it demands and receives a share from he 1 less fortunate Slates as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of over production began after 1.63. yet it is the hig growers who created this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> who are now receiving the lion’s share of a State entitlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In March we heard the honourable member for Dawson make this statement in the House:  lt is obvious  than   the Government has lulled lo warn the wheal grower.-, the public ami the taxpavers in sufficient time of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that has arisen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throughout this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> the Government has stretched every muscle to help the wheat industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The members of that organsation have played a major part in assisting in the best possible way the wheat industry in the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But just at this time of <span class="highlight">crisis</span> the wheat industry has been able to produce men of great substance to give this sort of leadership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sometimes feel very sad that the wool industry is not as united as the wheat industry in the moments of <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that it is going through at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following the negotiation of the stabilisation scheme it became perfectly obvious thai we were heading for a major <span class="highlight">crisis</span> because we were producing more than wc could dispose of and putting an abnormal strain on our storage facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is significant that these relations reached <span class="highlight">crisis</span>’ proportions at a time when the coalition parties had a monopoly of every government, Stale and Federal, in this country, a monopoly broken only last Saturday week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700609_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not saying that the Tasmanian apple growers should not be helped; but I repeat that it is not the function of the Australian wool growers - to help them in the urgent <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in which the wool industry finds itself today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-42-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My investigations have shown that the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that already exists in this industry could worsen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On Monday morning there were reports in the Press of another <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will it sit back and take it as it has done every other year when there has been a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in rural industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are all aware that there is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the wool industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For 3 years prior to the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span> facing the wheat industry the rumblings were present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government waited until the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The root causes were the despair and <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in values aroused in youth by the injustices which they saw in the established order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The distinctive features of the patterns of unrest could be characterised as, firstly, the influence of communications media in creating a generation consciousness; secondly, a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of legitimacy and a breakdown in the authority of any institution with which the youth generation disagreed; and thirdly, racial injustices and poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The present <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the industry requires a comprehensive approach which involves both immediate and longer term measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That in view of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> envisaged in the supply of trained dentists to provide a denial service to the Australian community the Commonwealth Government should, through the Australian Universities Coinmission, give high priority to forward planning for dental education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the mounting problem of pollution in our cities and the urgent need to take action before it reaches <span class="highlight">crisis</span> point, will the relevant Government department make a study of the Clean Air Act passed by the House of Commons 2 or 3 years ago, which has already beaten pollution in London and several industrial cities of England? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700821_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>in my electorate in speeches on radio and television I repeatedly have drawn attention to the drift in this young democratic country towards an immensely serious position - in fact, I believe, a disastrous <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the banking structure with all its instrumentalities and departments - the Commonwealth Development Bank established in I960, the Term Loan Fund established in 1962, the Farm Development Loan Fund established in 1966, and the private trading banking system with its overdraft system of lending - does not really provide the rural industries with the machinery necessary to recover from the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that faces them at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  Deputy  Prime Minister has spoken on at least 2 occasions - the last time in this House on Tuesday afternoon - but did he speak on the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in rural industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Anthony)  has said in this place that anyone who had anything to do with wheat at all could have foreseen this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> developing 5 years ago and therefore, 1 should say, could have acted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But rural Australia today faces a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that has implications going far beyond the confines of the farm or the country community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the countryside goes unresolved and if the family farm is abandoned, and with it many rural communities, we will create a vacuum in the countryside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>And what did the Treasurer  (Mr Bury)  say in the Budget about this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the countryside? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the high urgency of the Government on the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the countryside - a single sentence, an anomalous handout and a promise to give some thought to the problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have dictated every policy, every decision, and their answer to the worst <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the countryside in  2  generations is to put a tax on wine, and hit the one primary industry not in trouble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is evident that the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the Australian countryside will be blamed on European Economic Community, blamed on the callous British and blamed on the tendency of the world to divide into trading blocs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this year of <span class="highlight">crisis</span> for Australian farmers it is interesting to see how this Government is prepared to stand idly by while agricultural science courses are sabotaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that in the next 12 months there will be substantially more container vessels carrying cargoes than there have been in the last 12 months, In all these circumstances and in view of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the Australian wool industry I think it is regrettable that an added impost should now be demanded of Australian wool growers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So, as I have said, the research on our speeches, the seeking of solutions to the great problems - and I could mention Commonwealth-State relations, the improved Government performance that is needed, and the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the countryside - and all the necessary study and reading which go with these functions and with these problems are relatively neglected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But what the Minister failed to state was that a record number of our primary industries are facing an economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700922_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most outstanding of these must surely be the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in local governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700922_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The subject we raised was the failure of the Government to give any positive leadership to halt the growing economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in primary industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700922_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my purpose to address myself to the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the rural industries generally and in the wool industry in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700922_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">crisis</span> has been obvious for years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700922_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we consider the estimates of the Department of Primary Industry tonight and review the estimated expenditure of $70m we must pose the query as to how the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Anthony)  can accept the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the countryside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700922_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might be said that he does not accept it all, that he is fighting manfully to end the <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, to restore confidence and prevent the flight from the farms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700922_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet it is the policies that have been his direct responsibility on behalf of the Government that have led to the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in half the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700922_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s decisions on wheat have contributed to the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the countryside in a major way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700922_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the countryside has been contributed to by the Government’s decision on wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700922_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has power in its hands to begin to end the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the countryside by taking in and paying for all wheat produced last season and this season within its own national ration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700922_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have just heard the honourable member for Riverina  (Mr Grassby)  say that there is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the countryside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700922_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is easy to identify the villain of the piece in the prevailing rural <span class="highlight">crisis</span> - namely, inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700923_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What then is to be done now in the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> affecting the whole of the rural economy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700923_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of conscience was the war in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of conscience was not conscription, not military service, but participation in the Vietnam war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, admittedly, since 1967, the Commonwealth has been giving some direct help towards meeting the teacher <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They and their successors for years to come will pay the enormous penalty - and so will the nation incidently - for the blank refusal by a succession of Liberal Party-Country Party federal governments to see the obviously approaching <span class="highlight">crisis</span> years before it came. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not an over-statement to use the word ‘<span class="highlight">crisis</span>’ to describe the position in this most important department, but one can detect no sign of any Government concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would achieve nothing more than a postponement of the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span> for a few years after which the problems would return with greater intensity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thus preventive and long term chronic care services are submerged to acute and <span class="highlight">crisis</span> care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, only the Commonwealth has available the sort of financial resources to avert the gathering <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in Australia’s public hospital services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At what stage does the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of conscience come for them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But then the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> comes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remember  Sir Robert  Menzies, when he was Prime Minister, coming back from an overseas conference on the Suez <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in 1956 and giving a report to Anthony Eden on what he had discovered on his trip up the Nile with the late  President  Nasser. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not regard the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the countryside or the matters to which I have referred in the nation as a whole as matters of laughter and amusement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No emergency relief is offered in the compounding housing <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which exists in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a housing <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and this Government should institute a national inquiry into housing needs and associated matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall, in any section of the community in Western Australia, there is a housing <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Why perpetuate the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of the present in the future? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is making a great deal more sense on the housing issue because he is treating it as  a  <span class="highlight">crisis</span> - with every justification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sydney and Melbourne these days are drawing migrants from a countryside in <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the Middle East. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new impost on fuel, as he just said, will be a lax on the development of the nation, lt will certainly be a hurtful tax in relation to a countryside in <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He said that the price rise would bring about a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the industry in a couple of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This legislation has been introduced as an emergency measure to meet what must be regarded as a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in Chamberlain Industries, in particular, and in International Harvester Co. of Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course this was a recognition of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which exists in the countryside at the present time, lt was an acknowledgment of the difficulties which are being experienced internally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that it is a component of rural industry and that the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the countryside has now spread to the cities, we should place it on record in this debate that the Australian agricultural machinery industry faces the retrenchment of 14,000 men this year as a result not only of imports but of the continuing rural <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet if the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is allowed to continue it could mean the complete extinction of the Australian controlled agricultural machinery industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that with due weight and seriousness, because the components of the industry have said that they are feeling the Weight of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the countryside and they are feeling the weight of interests that would be quite happy to take them over Australia exports nearly $8m worth of agricultural machinery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today its turnover is down by half and its work force is rationed as far as employment is concerned because of the situation and the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which exists in the countryside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The challenge to end the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the countryside is clear and urgent, as my colleague the honourable member for Dawson has pointed out, not only in the interests of the countryside itself but in the interests of city workers and city industries such as we are talking about at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I pointed out, the rural <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is hitting not only the farmers but country businessmen and employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I submit that this is not just a rural <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a national <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it suggesting that this will meet the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the agricultural machinery industry and the nation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The debate then went on from the subject of tractors to the effect of the rural <span class="highlight">crisis</span> on the cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that if the Government had not made advance payments amounting, as he said in his speech, to between $650m and $700m, for wheat, much of which was unsold, the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> would have been much more severe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should be persist time and again in this Parliament whenever he is on his feet in saying that there is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in this industry or in that industry - he mentioned the word ‘<span class="highlight">crisis</span>’ 7 times tonight - or that there is a down turn, the survival of the countryside is not possible or that the battle of the countryside is lost, he will instil- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 rise tonight to rectify an injustice which has been perpetrated by the Government against people in the Australian countryside who have had the temerity to believe that we have a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the rural sector and that the Parliament should know about it and perhaps apply itself to rectifying it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I cannot understand how men who come in from the countryside in <span class="highlight">crisis</span> can turn their backs on people of good will who are doing their best. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He knows full well that what I said was a complete endorsement of Government policy on this, -because we argued in this Parliament for most of last year on the wheat <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that there had to be some control on production and if the industry had a larger peak it was obvious that the first advance payment would have to be reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is further concern in the ranks of the Commonwealth meat inspectors, lt has arisen from a rumour which is circulating that the Government is considering a dilute plan for the industry, using the farmers and farm workers who have lost their farms or employment due to the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the wheat and wool industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, we all know the Government’s form: It will not want to come back within cooee of New Years Day, so if we get up and do not return in 1970 we will not take action until a number of months have passed, and in every week that passes there will be more bankruptcies and in every month that passes there will be a deepening of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to make our commitment clear before dealing with the legislation that the Government has brought down, in contrast, 4 months after the Opposition acted,  7  months after the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> began and 21 years after taking office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I also make it plain to wool growers and to the nation that this legislation, this Government answer to the wool <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, is not what the industry asked for; it is not what the growers have demanded; it is not what the Opposition is firmly pledged to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who would have thought that in a matter of a few months we would have seen the wool industry completely united and the Government acting in such time to try to meet the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that the industry is facing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Forward selling is not, in my view, the cause of the economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> among woolgrowers, nor is it the reason for the low level of prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Merely to lay the blame for the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> on the level of wool prices is not logical, and clearly the adverse season has been a major cause in the reduction in prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Corangamite refuted allegations made by the honourable member foi Dawson  (Dr Patterson)  to the effect that the Government had done nothing to deal with the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the wool industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two principles are fundamental to a serious approach to the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which threatens destruction to thousands of wool growers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not necessary to highlight the disastrous effect that the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is already having in country towns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second fundamental principle required to be recognised in any realistic and serious approach to the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is urgent and realistic government action, not mere window dressing and confidence tricks on the eve of an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only the Government has been unable to recognise the <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When one asks the question: ‘Does the Bill before the House deal seriously with the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> facing wool growers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidently members of the Australian Labor Party have been very concerned about the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the wool industry and have been doing a lot of study on the subject to enable them to make their contribution to the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>I feel that the Country Party members have a bigger responsibility in this matter and 1 hope that they will live up to it because there is no doubt that there is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the wool industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#debate-37">[More…]</a></li>

  <li>
    <p>My point is that the colleges of advanced education are going through a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and it is up to the Government to recognise this situation and provide the necessary action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be true that ultimately they develop to a point where you think that the word ‘‘<span class="highlight">crisis</span>’ is deserved, but I think it is deserved very many fewer times than the honourable member for Bendigo and some of his confreres on the other side of the House would like to have us believe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We came in when the universities were in a state of <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, when we had the findings of the Murray Commission, and we have come in at election times with Commonwealth scholarships, with science grants, with grants for school libraries and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in education would be precisely what the honourable member for Denison  (Dr Solomon)  said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In denying the existence of a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> he said how very difficult it is to get adequate university staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in educataion is, of course, the inability of institutions to adjust very quickly to a complete change in the values in the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously we have as a consequence a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in trying to adjust our universities, colleges of advanced education, and technical schools to the new demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of adjustment is not only in new buildings and in new student places; it is, of course, in the effort to attract staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member for Denison said in denying that there is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, it is extremely difficult for universities and colleges of advanced education to get staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a significant increase in the salaries of university lecturers and professors, and I am not criticising this, but when we talk about difficulties in education, problems in education and the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in education, it is interesting to note that in 1952 the salary of a subject master in the New South Wales Department of Education was approximately equal to that of a university lecturer whereas in 1970 the salary of the subject master is approximately only two-thirds of that of a university lecturer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Premier of New South Wales, after saying that there were no real problems and that no-one had been refused, now says: ‘We are in a considerable difficulty because of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the countryside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Later it stated:  lt also supports student representation on academic government bodies, as opposed to consultation, offers warnings about student unrest over examinations and a looming <span class="highlight">crisis</span> over residential accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This, of course, is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of great magnitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She pinpointed the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> as being mainly in Sydney, Wollongong, Canberra and Newcastle and, to some extent, in other capital cities as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that administration expenses are to be the responsibility of the States, but the objective of the scheme is to ensure that primary producers will be able to have some opportunity within this amount to embark on rehabilitation at a time when the rural <span class="highlight">crisis</span> generally has so adversely affected them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The truth is that most of the elements of the current <span class="highlight">crisis</span> were identified by the Constitution Review Committee which the Parliament established after the credit squeeze of 1956. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even Liberals would now have less difficulty in managing the Australian economy if they had been less sceptical of the proposals they commissioned from experts in movements of economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and electoral despair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister’s own ad hoc decisions, disregard for advice, electoral opportunism and insensitivity to the indirect effects of particular actions have now produced just that sort of economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> with which his government is so clearly ill-equipped lo cope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So as long as that Party, its allies and its present leadership have been in government, this nation has faced an inflationary <span class="highlight">crisis</span> on an average of every 5 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In no other way can the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in education be solved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then essentially, over a short period of time, it was elevated by the public media and by the commentators into a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> situation, but it never was a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If at the same time it imposes cuts upon the States so that they cannot supply these services it is merely producing a <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In these figures and in this performance lie the explanation as to why one of the richest countries in the world has bad roads, overcrowded schools, inadequate hospital buildings and 1 million poor people with half of its rural industries in <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Frank McGuren, because it was through his constant advocacy, persistence, constant representations, speeches in this place and uflagging zeal in talking about these matters, that the Government finally in a time of <span class="highlight">crisis</span> was compelled to take action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710309_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The initial Press <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is one in which the former Prime Minister, like the flowers that bloom in the spring, has nothing to do with the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which has shattered the Government in the past 10 days stemmed in large measure from interpretation and implementation of defence policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Warringah  (Mr Mackellar)  has revealed a tendency that is all too apparent in the policies of the Government when faced with a national <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and a national problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although a large proportion of Australia’s most important export industry is faced with financial disaster and even extinction, the Government has made no effort to inform the Parliament, the wool growers or the taxpayers of this nation of its proposed actions in the immediate future to counter this <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710317_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to quote some extracts from a very thoughtful contribution by Frank Brennan in his book Canberra in <span class="highlight">Crisis</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To my mind the unfortunate feature of this legislation is that it is directed against a section of society which, if it has not already been proved, will be shown by history to have displayed to the nation during the Vietnam <span class="highlight">crisis</span> the deepest sense of nationalism that any Australians have ever before displayed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let me, because of limitation of time, confine my remarks to one area of need which has reached <span class="highlight">crisis</span> proportions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That there is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in Aboriginal Welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the unquestionable evidence of the growing financial <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the rural sector which has been available to the Government for at least the last 3 years, the Government has exhibited an incredible display of apathy and confusion with respect to this national problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the gravity of impending bankruptcy of major sections of rural Australia, the cold fact apparently is that the Liberal-Country Party Government just does not have comprehensive policies or immediate plans to combat this <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the eyes of the Government apparently such matters as law and order as affected by student demonstrations, and the perennial Communist bogey, are far more important to the nation than the critical economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that is threatening the economic livelihood of rural areas throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But it was obvious when this Parliament first met on that famous 1-day sitting that the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> was growing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet the Government programme outlined by the GovernorGeneral indicated that all was well with the nation and that there was no <span class="highlight">crisis</span> anywhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further, if this intrusion is to be allowed has consideration been given to the effect that it will have on the prospects of rural workers, already displaced and about to be displaced due to the rural <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, obtaining employment in industry and commerce in this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710428_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since the Board’s financial <span class="highlight">crisis</span> stems from this Government’s high interest policy, can the increase in water rates be avoided by a Commonwealth grant? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This scheme is one of a series of measures designed to help meet a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> situation in the rural industries, and particularly the sheep and sheep-wheat industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At various times, sometimes on small matters and sometimes on matters of <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, the Government has said emphatically to the Parliament of the nation: ‘This is urgent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is there any honourable member opposite who denies that a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> exists in primary industries today? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been possibly drawn up by economists, but the Australian Labor Party’s point of view is that if bad policies have caused the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span> the Federal Government must accept responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his speech introducing this legislation he gave figures to demonstrate the fact of that <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basis of the legislation is to be found in the report on the current rural <span class="highlight">crisis</span> commissioned by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet the Government can find only $100m in 4 years to deal with the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in half the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the eve of the State election in Western Australia the members of that organisation invited all the representatives of the political parties to be present on the platform to deliver to a very substantial gathering of women from rural areas the policies of their parties and what they proposed to do in respect of the rural <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the course of these discussions the present Premier of Western Australia, the then Leader of the Opposition, was asked what he was prepared to do about the rural <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we consider that the economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the rural community extends over the 6 States of the Commonwealth and that this money must be divided among a number of people in those States, it is a long way from being sufficient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Government supporters have spoken only with regret and apologies about this Bill and no wonder because, despite the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> facing rural industries in Australia, the Government has not been able to bring forward legislation which can seriously tackle the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the reports that several European countries have announced somewhat dramatically that foreign trading in their currencies has been suspended; in view of the very strong possibility of revaluation of those European currencies and the attendant possibility of a movement in the international valuation of the Japanese yen; and in view of the international paper which is held in those currencies by the Federal Government and certain of its instrumentalities, can the Treasurer inform the House to what extent and in what detail this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is being followed by Australian authorities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill we have before us is just another example of the ricocheting from one <span class="highlight">crisis</span> to another which is the story of Commonwealth-State relationships, and we hardly even get the chance to discuss the sad position of local government finances in this Parliament unless the matter is brought forward as a matter of public importance by the Labor Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that from the year 1971-72 onwards we will have more formal relationships and that we will not be ricocheting from one <span class="highlight">crisis</span> to another in this field and that we will not have Bills such as this one being brought up in the dying, hours of the sittings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 31st December, a little over 4 months ago, the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> as the Minister termed it, with respect to this company, was fully acknowledged by the Government of Victoria and the Commonwealth to the degree that this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> was said to be so urgent that this money was made available to the Victorian Government by the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what I object to - I think every member of the Parliament should object to it - is that this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> was known on 31 December last, 4 months ago; yet the agreement was not signed until yesterday, and the Bill was not introduced until 1 o’clock this morning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> was known in December, I would assume that the Cabinet made a decision before the money was made available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>CANBERRA - ‘There is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> situation in the wool processing industry which may soon match that of the wool producers,’ the  president  of Wool Textile Manufacturers of Australia,  Mr S.  D. Kelly, said here today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is worried because of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which exists in the rural industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is put to us that the Country Party and the coalition Government have not been looking after the interests of the primary producer in this period of <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister, in view of the financial <span class="highlight">crisis</span> facing non-profit approved nursing homes, make an immediate subsidy of $2 per day (in addition to the ordinary nursing home care of $2 per day or the intensive care of$5 per day Commonwealth benefit) to all full-rate pensioners who are accommodated in these nursing homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710820_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-41-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government ensure that in the present world financial <span class="highlight">crisis</span> Australia follows the strengthening British pound’ and that it does not follow deflationary currencies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their present predicament is just as serious and challenging as was any <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the last war when huge sacrifices and countless billions of dollars were spent to bring it to an end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in times of a rural <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that all sorts of people will raise their ugly heads. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two days before the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden)  introduced this Budget, the  President  of the United States announced measures which have precipitated a great international currency <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget will further split the nation and worsen the artificial <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which has been foisted on the countryside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The root of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> lies in the agricultural sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my intention to demonstrate this inter-dependence and to pose basic policies to end what is demonstrably a false <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, a needless depression in the Australian countryside at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But first let us examine the papers on national income which the Treasurer used as the basis for his budgeting and then establish what the Government intends to do about the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in half the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our present substantial overseas balances could disappear as a consequence of the present world currency <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which makes the Budget already out of date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not yet had any indication of what the future holds in regard to the present monetary <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s attitude in completely ignoring this area in the Budget is similar to the contempt shown to the education <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which exists in Australia and which has brought condemnation from private and government school bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the increased overseas control of our finance, no wonder our Government has not been able to predict how a world monetary <span class="highlight">crisis</span> will affect us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission usually is painted as the villain in our present cost-push inflationary <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, and certainly last year’s 6 per cent national wage rise was remarkably ill-judged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What can we do to control the alarming rise in the wages drift which, on top of the 6 per cent national wage rise, has caused our present inflationary <span class="highlight">crisis</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our secondary school system there is a terrible, deep and prolonged <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think only one thing will attend to the mounting <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask honourable members to look, for example, at the rural <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The big man who is grazing cattle who is in no real state of <span class="highlight">crisis</span> does not need it so much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That there is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in Aboriginal Welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-0-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that in the days ahead of this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> the Government will stress this point in those councils. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As he said, it is preliminary and really not much has happened in the last few days other than that, the situation has not accelerated further into a <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has there been an upward revaluation of the Australian dollar since the current international currency <span class="highlight">crisis</span> began? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been described as a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and one tends to think of a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> as drawing to a point and then having something happen but this should more properly be described as a plateau. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my view that there is an even greater <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in our cities than exists in the rural areas, even though their position is catastrophic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not matter if man’s value system - and I even include the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  who is at the table - is Communist, Fascist, Conservative, Liberal or Socialist, he faces a global <span class="highlight">crisis</span> based on the fact that his population increase, his squandering of natural resources, his control of food production, his accelerated urbanisation and his release of a wide variety of toxic substances into the environment are directing him on a collision course with disaster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Medical research has reduced the dangers of infectious disease and this has added to the population <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, but now pollution is beginning to take its toll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He shows that an inevitable pollution <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which will cause the death of 83 per cent of the world’s population will follow and that it will predominantly affect developed countries rather than developing countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If all the people on earth had such an opportunity we would have had a pollution <span class="highlight">crisis</span> much earlier than we have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> would have occurred if the people of India had the same standards of living as we have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gives the Government no power to deal with the real <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not deal in any shape or form with the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in our cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no reference whatever to the dollar <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which is shaking the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy enunciated with regard to the dollar <span class="highlight">crisis</span> by  President  Nixon is an economic watershed for the world and the United States has the economic muscle to decide what it wants to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for the future, we can expect an intensification of the present economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The truth is that we are facing a stark economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the current dollar-yen currency <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, if the Budget had not contained the provision for a 36c deficiency payment scheme which has brought stability into the industry, I believe there would be absolute chaos and panic in the wool industry in Australia at the present moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also a retraining scheme for young people displaced in the rural <span class="highlight">crisis</span> will be introduced this session. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should consider seriously those people displaced by the rural <span class="highlight">crisis</span> who are too old to be retrained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the current <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the rural areas of the electorate of Franklin these charges will merely exacerbate the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his opening remarks the Leader of the Opposition has accused the  President  of the United States of America of precipitating a great international currency <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, seeking always to gratify those elements within the Australian Labor Party which are notorious for their anti-Americanism, which are known to the Australian people as the left wing of the Australian Labor Party, he is ready to brand the  President  as a sinister influence engaged by inference in some monstrous capitalistic plot to create a great international currency <span class="highlight">crisis</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With an unparalleled school <span class="highlight">crisis</span> - and many members of this side oi’ the House and even on the Government side have referred to the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in education that exists right across the nation - we have seen 3 Ministers for Education and Science in half a school year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned overseas capital, questions relating to national development, education, the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the primary industries, the need for a real policy of decentralisation of population, the need to deal with urban problems, the need to deal with immigration and the need to achieve a national identity which involves the quality of life and films which we make ourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Put briefly, the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> facing the Government is to assure the payment of the new pay rates and improved conditions for servicemen decreed by the Kerr Committee while freeing sufficient resources for the reequipment programme it has announced over the past 2 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer very briefly to the rural <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that these measures are especially inappropriate at this stage of the international monetary <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main topic I want to discuss tonight is the wool industry because if ever there has been a national <span class="highlight">crisis</span> it certainly has been in wool. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the same reason I believe it is quite spurious to ascribe the present situation to the international monetary <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, although this could become a factor in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make no mistake about it, the responsible party in this <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, as in so many crises that have existed in the past during the reign of various Liberal Party-Country Party governments, is very clearly this Government itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The quality of life or the standard of living which is the right of every Australian to enjoy is today grossly inadequate, ft will continue to be so while this decaying, crumbling Government continues to falter from one <span class="highlight">crisis</span> to the next, with each one more calamitous than that which preceded it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One such policy promise was that the Government would accept some responsibility for this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in pre-school education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government with its laissez-faire capitalistic attitude allows free enterprise monopolies, land sharks and finance companies to exploit the community at will, and only when a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> arises does it acf to overcome a situation which competent planning could have avoided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that, at some stage, he was almost coming to one of the points of <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">crisis</span> has now passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I indicated that at least this was consistent with a tradition which was less than commendable of antiLabor goverments - the 1913 Cook Government, the 1923 to 1928 period under the Bruce-Page Government and the 1938 period under the Lyons Government - which gave pledges to the public that people had rights in retirement and in certain situations of <span class="highlight">crisis</span> need, and that the only way to overcome or to satisfy these needs was through a contributory system of social insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to what is commonly called the rural <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and also the urban <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That there is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in Aboriginal Welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-1-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They referred to deficiency payments for wool; to the ‘rural <span class="highlight">crisis</span>’ - and I am using their words; and to the need for the provision of more funds for the rural reconstruction scheme, for long term finance, for rehabilitation, for assistance to local government for the relief of unemployed persons in their areas, and for assistance with rating, tariff, freight and inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it suggested that there is not a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in non-metropolitan employment in the eastern States of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget also does not take into account the world currency <span class="highlight">crisis</span> brought about by the announcements by the United States Government 2 days before the Budget was introduced, which could have a dramatic effect on this country’s trade and capital transactions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the currency <span class="highlight">crisis</span> it seems to me that the Australian Government is confused as to what action it should take in regard to Australian exchange rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Before leaving the question of the difficult rural <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and the problems of bringing relief to this disaster area, I would like, in the short time at my disposal, to devote some time to a consideration of the proposed deficiency payment scheme for the 1970-71 wool clip. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the former Minister for External Affairs and former honourable member for Forrest,  Mr Gordon  Freeth - the present Ambassador to Japan - introduced his infamous new Government line on the proposed Soviet security treaty in the Indian Ocean, etc., in 1969, I was the first in this Parliament to place on record strong criticism of our linking ourselves in any way in  a  security treaty with the Soviet Union, just as I criticised our involvement with the United States of America in Vietnam and our involvement with the United Kingdom in the Malaysian-Indonesian <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are, as I see them in broad, simple terms and not necessarily in order of importance: Firstly, a series of adverse seasons since 1964 over a wide area of Australia; secondly, marketing difficulties, especially export marketing difficulties with such products as wheat; thirdly, the low export prices on world markets for many rural products, wool in particular, compounded by Britain’s likely entry to the European Economic Community; fourthly, the growing use of synthetics, or alternatives to products of rural origin; fifthly, the constantly rising cost of production; sixthly, the international currency <span class="highlight">crisis</span>; and, seventhly, the whole rural economy has been geared to the era of post war prosperity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another matter I would like to draw to the Government’s attention is that it had a former Minister for External Affairs, now the Governor-General, who in the Bihar famine <span class="highlight">crisis</span> - this is very little realised in Australia - sent $35m in aid to India. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The great question mark lying against this scheme and the Government’s attitude generally to the rural <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is: Where is it envisaged that this retraining scheme will take place? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I point out, first, that at this time when our country is heading for an economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> the more powers that can be held in the hands of the Commonwealth - particularly taxing powers, which can help in economic planning - the better for this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do not have to look to the banks, or to the Scotts or the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia for signs of this trend, for this message that unless there is quick appreciation of this problem - far quicker than it would seem is applying to this present Government at the present time if the answers of the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  at question time this week are any indication - we are heading for a serious economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> with rising unemployment, even worse unemployment than we are experiencing right now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The policy of this Government became ‘All the way with LBJ’ and Australia found that it was committed because it was felt that in a time of <span class="highlight">crisis</span> the United States of America might come to our aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With aircrew insecurity, a record unemployment level among aircrew and an international monetary <span class="highlight">crisis</span> taking place, it will be a national disgrace to allow such major expenditure to continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710930_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This expenditure has meant that all sorts of development projects in India have had to go by the board because that country’s budgetary effort has been distorted by this sudden and unexpected expenditure on 9 million people who haderupted over their borders into India as a result of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in East Pakistan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a serious belief, because it is quite obvious that Australia’s mineral exports are of vital importance to its future, particularly with respect to the rural <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, in view of this, I must ask, request or challenge - whatever one likes to call it - the Queensland Minister for Mines,  Mr Camm,  to prove his belief that there is a Communist plot in Australia to smash the export coal industry by raising the price of coal so much that it would be lucrative for overseas Communist countries to supply coal to Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>International authorities associated with the Japanese economy state categorically that the slowing down in Japan’s imports of coal and iron ore is a direct result of the steel recession which is now being accelerated by the international monetary <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in which Japan and the United States of America are the key combatants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Japanese authorities indicate that as a result of the cancelled or deferred options, cancelled contracts or other agreements, imports of iron ore and coal could be reduced by as much as 25 per cent if the international monetary <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is not satisfactorily solved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On that occasion, I pointed out that a record number of our primary industries were facing an economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and that this record sum of $21 5m would be spread out so thinly that in places it would have little or no useful effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I finish on this note: The real <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in education is that it can produce this kind of insular remark. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When <span class="highlight">crisis</span> threatens an industry associated with the rural sector of this country the Commonwealth Government acts quickly to make finance available by way of subsidy or grant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is now to hit the student campus and the casualties will be from the lower income families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Commonwealth was properly concerned about economic barriers to higher education, the plight of many students and families and the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in universities finance, it would do precisely the opposite - it would subsidise universities that kept fees down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Catholic education on the central coast of New South Wales is approaching a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> situation and will need very heavy support from both the State and Commonwealth Governments if it is to survive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Prime Minister aware that major sectors of primary industry are now experiencing the worst financial <span class="highlight">crisis</span> since the great depression 40 years ago and that even more serious problems will be experienced in the immediate future as conditions worsen and unemployment grows in country areas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of all the Ministers in the Government, it is the Minister for Primary Industry most of all who should be in Australia in the immediate future because of the rural <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and in view of his ministerial responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is this not an act of stupidity as well as a blatant contempt of the rural <span class="highlight">crisis</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The regrettable thing is that despite the magnitude of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> at this point of time there is every indication that it will deteriorate even further because, despite the aid which has been provided by this and other countries- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead we should all be insuring, by means of a national fund collected via taxation, by regular payments to the doctors and hospitals as they need them so that the service is there for the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> occasion when we become ill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is creating just as much a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> as any other single factor, because people who normally would have been able to obtain overdraft accommodation for their operations are now being told: ‘No more; we are sorry’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister has introduced this wool scheme as part of a complex of measures which the Government claims is the answer to the rural <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Minister say today that there is no <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in rural reconstruction and that there is no problem in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I sum up in this way: The <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is worsening and the time for action is now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government recognises that the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the wool industry calls for a number of measures which in aggregate represent a concerted approach to the urgent problems affecting woolgrowers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Current difficulties have been aggravated by the world monetary <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and the 10 per cent surcharge which has been imposed by the United States of America on our wool exports on top of the existing 25c a lb import duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But a pessimistic view was put by Emeritus Professor T. G.

    <p>I have been prepared to accept the view that up to date the Government may have been wise to sit out this sort of <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many of us on this side of the House who have spent a lifetime in sheep raising areas have in the last few years made every attempt to serve warning on this nation that the crippling conspiracy of drought and poor market conditions would bring Australians giant industry to a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of human factors, as the Minister rightly reminds us, but Australian assistance in the previous <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in Pakistan - the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which was caused by the tidal wave disaster - was tardy and ungenerous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we tend to flinch from giving aid in this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> because we think it may be a continuing development - if there is a continuing situation in East Pakistan that will produce more refugees - still we have to look back with disappointment at the Australian reaction to the disaster which was not man made and which was not continuing in East Pakistan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No doubt it was a factor in producing the immense vote for Mujibur Rahman and finally producing the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> between East and West Pakistan which lies at the root of the present situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is the most likely catalyst for a world war facing world humanity in our time, and it needs more than some cursory and casual consideration of the aid factor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, the United States has recognised that this dollar <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is only the last of a series of crises which have affected ;n turn the pound sterling, the French franc, the German Deutsche mark, and now the United States dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am not suggesting for a moment that we should turn our backs on the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the rural industry but at the same time I am not suggesting that the Government is without blame for the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in that industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whenever another Government inspired <span class="highlight">crisis</span> looms the blame is placed on demands for wage increases, the high wages now being paid and/or industrial unrest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That means that the dead hand remains because while it is run by Government officials who have no personal responsibility for any issue and have no personal interest in the airline we will get this delay, this retarded reaction to any <span class="highlight">crisis</span> with the result that a company which has made substantial profits and given substantial contributions to the airline industry in Australia is now faced with a deficit, retrenchments and all the problems that lead to a major disaster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We can only say that never before has it faced such a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and never before has Australian primary industry faced a greater <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, and that includes the depression, because then at least we knew that it was an economic depression and that the dark cloud had a silver lining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that most of the wool brokers in Australia are doing their best to try to help wool growers to restore their profitability, and I believe that if it were not for the efforts of the private sector to assist generally the financial operations of primary producers, the rural sector would have been in a far worse <span class="highlight">crisis</span> over the last few years than has been the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With costs continually rising and the salaries of teachers increasing, a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> has developed in independent schools in many of our states and Ml credit is owing to the Minister for Education and Science, who is now at the table, and particularly the Prime Minister for the emergency action that they took so that the schools would know what they were able to do in the new term which was to open early in the new year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So while Government supporters may use whatever methods or tactics are available to them in this debate to endeavour to drive a wedge between the parents of children who attend government and non-government schools in Australia, the fact remains that no-one on the Government side who has spoken in this debate has denied that there is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in education, that these inequalities do exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apart from the domestic shocks from wage cost inflation and severe industrial unrest, we have also witnessed external shocks to the system from the international monetary <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and the slowdown in the Japanese economy, which affected the expansion plans of our mineral industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>think we have in Australia at the moment is what Professor Henderson recently described in a lecture given in Melbourne as ‘too much instant government’ - acting when the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is on you instead of preparing to avoid a <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The problem essentially is that in the present unemployment <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, Western Australia is suffering more and is being assisted by the Commonwealth less than is any other State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope there will be less of the kind of talk we have heard tonight, because if anything helps to precipitate a rush on or a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> about a currency it is people beginning to talk about whether it may go up or it may go down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are tired of a government that gets its policies from the gallup poll; that reacts to every test of leadership and statesmanship by playing on every prejudice and fear lying dormant in the community; that acts in every national or international <span class="highlight">crisis</span> only in terms of the political advantage it can squeeze out of it - whether it be China, South Africa, Bangladesh or French nuclear tests, or whether it be poverty, industrial relations, racism or rural depression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Obviously there are several alternatives but, to my mind, it demonstrates that after long and critical examination of the increased capital intensive nature of primary industry the Government is moving with certainty towards the provision of a facility which will help all primary producers to meet the servicing of their debts, which regrettably are eroding their profitability and are essentially one of the causes of the past <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the rural industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer in particular to the employment situation in my electorate where industries such as steel fabrication works are in a serious situation due to the scaling down or, in fact, the stopping of development projects caused by the international economic situation, the effects of this Commonwealth Government’s previous budgets and the failure of the Commonwealth to recognise the impending consequences of the situation and to take action on a national scale to rectify the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that it had .itself assisted to create. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, positive legislation is needed to ensure maximum Australian equity, participation and control of these national assets; secondly, we must tap the vast reservoir of the Australian capital market; and, thirdly - I no longer request this but demand it on behalf of the people who have any concern for the assets of this country and our national heritage - we must set up immediately a national inquiry to establish concrete policies and guidelines which will co-ordinate, identify, and quantify, and plan the most economic and efficient use of these vast resources of fuel and energy, based not on this Government’s ad hoc, puerile decisions which are reached on a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> to <span class="highlight">crisis</span> basis, but on what this nation’s supply and demand requirements will be not only in the next decade, but also - this is equally important - for the next half century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless there is a reappraisal of the situation we will come to a stage of a very great <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, % complete disintegration of local government works that will mean that finally the Com.monwealth will be forced in a period of chaos to enter the field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On Monday he created the usual Australian Labor Party aura of havoc or <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in respect of something which is totally unprovable to be either havoc or <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and said that we should be doing the absolute opposite and encouraging people to produce more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I must say that as far as Canberra employees of the Public Service are concerned I have no doubt that the basic qualities I outlined are being stretched to the limit by the rash of legislation brought about by the Labor Government and also by the ready willingness of senior Ministers of the Labor Government ruthlessly to attempt to shift the blame for a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> - a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> either for the Government or for the Minister - on to members of the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that the honourable gentleman’s economics stop somewhere in the 1930s, but it is the very fact that there is an international economic machinery and that there is a better understanding of the underlying forces than there was in 1930 that the currency troubles have not generated a severe <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in world trade and employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This national Government is faced with a world energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to make the humble observation that whilst 1 agree that there is a world energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, if one takes the time to analyse the situation in the United States one finds that a high proportion of oil, gas uranium and fossil fuel is owned and controlled by multi-national corporations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its failure to do so has put the United States in a position where today its natural gas and particularly its crude oil reserves have reached <span class="highlight">crisis</span> proportions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude on this point: When the people of Australia realise just how important it is for a nation to control its resources, whether they be oil, gas, uranium or fossil fuel, in the national interest and in terms of the world energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, the Government must be in the position to act in the national interest and, more importantly, in the international interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is ludicrous that today when the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is a major global problem, possibly the global problem for the rest of the century, with the horrible spectre of trade wars before us once more, Australia has difficulty in rising above the level of federal-State bickering to develop a national policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of all people on the Government side of the chamber who should not be saying anything at the present time about creating uncertainty in rural industry it is the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Grassby)  because he more than anybody else has caused the rural <span class="highlight">crisis</span> because of the statements which he has made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Though there is no evidence of it from his statement, the Prime Minister should have known that the previous Government had taken action through the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of Foreign Affairs to develop a resources diplomacy for Australia, particularly in view of the rapid consumption of the world’s resources and the real prospect of an energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I add that in the sort of world in which we are living at the moment - a world where there is an energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> - it is plain to people who look at the problem that it is quite possible, in the near future, that Australia will not be able to import the fuel that it needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is not any doubt in my mind that the Jewish people and the Arab nations have taken a battering over a number of years because of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the Middle East, but I make this plea on 3 grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In those big televised meetings between Nixon, Brezhnev, Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai in Moscow and Peking, the leaders of the major powers agreed to support universal principles, which would lead to a new order in the world, but when they all gathered around here at the United Nations on the East River during the latest Middle East <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, they sang a different tune. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I, like other honourable members and concerned people, am worried that very often in debates such as this we talk a lot about the environment and create the illusion that a great deal is being done when in fact little is being done and that which is being achieved is often being achieved in a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> atmosphere; where large sums of money are needed to save something in respect of which the public conscience cries out that it should be saved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any intelligent observer would realise that to effect any real changes for the better in the many areas of <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and the mess we inherited as a result of a lack of sensibly directed public programs would involve some unpopular decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A point is quickly being reached - it is in fact being intensified by the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span> precipitated in the Arab countries in respect of pricing - when it will be as economical to extract oil, petroleum and other derivatives from suitable coal types as to produce them from the ground by drilling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was the only sentry at the gate who was talking about the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that could face the world and this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At a time of world energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of incalculable proportions and a time of Arab gunboat oil diplomacy of the most callous and calculated kind, when a world depression is almost a foregone conclusion in the face of that diplomacy by the Arabs, Australia requires from the Minister 2 things: Firstly, a clear, simple and accurate statement of Australia’s domestic oil supplies and future domestic demands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time a record number of our primary industries were facing an economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think all of us have to look at this process in terms of the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and also in terms of getting rid of pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me, with the fuel <span class="highlight">crisis</span> exacerbating, that this form of waste digestion providing methane gas could be a goer much sooner than most people think. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> resulting from the Middle East activities could spark off a world involvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The world energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> highlights major world reliance on oil and natural gas for its energy needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia could well be heading for a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> if we do not take significant steps to expand our construction force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One would have expected it to have tried to reduce the industrial strife that is a major factor in the shortages <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And because it has done the opposite, the people of Australia are experiencing a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of shortages - a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which will take on a new meaning as Christmas demand mounts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a major factor in the shortages <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of factors have conspired to bring about the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The establishment of the Corporation comes at a time when the apple and pear industry is in <span class="highlight">crisis</span> - as if it has not been in <span class="highlight">crisis</span> for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ironically, of course, the whole matter need not develop into a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> because it would be competent for the local authorities to deny permission to the developers to subdivide the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think it reasonable to suppose that most Australians look for national government leadership in the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, both present and prospective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is so deep-rooted in its nature and far-reaching in its effects that some direct government interest in the industry is legitimate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion I point out that we do have an energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do have a Government which, fortunately, is planning, and has planned, for that <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Government relies on this percentage of self sufficiency, which has resulted from incentives and concessions given by the former Government over 23 years of office and which has enabled the Australian community to be in the happy position that it is in today in the face of the world energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a background of an undoubted world energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The world energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, into which the Arab oil producing nations have plunged the world, will surely reach Australia’s shores. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister seems to have swallowed hook, line and sinker the Minister’s oft repeated statement about the impending energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has happened in the United States when faced with a world energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> particularly in petroleum and natural gas, and when that country may be forced to convert to coal is that many if its mines have run down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where I part with the honourable member for Farrer is that there is beyond any question a world energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told, and we are all aware of the fact, that there is a world energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of the present time has not occurred only over the last 2 or 3 weeks with the diplomacy used by Arab states in making their message known to the states of Europe, to Japan or to any other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The importance of the creation of a new Ministry of Minerals and Energy has been confirmed by the events of 1973 associated with the developing world energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740228_reps_28_hor88/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although Australia is in a more fortunate position than most comparable nations in this <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, my Government will not be complacent in planning for the future energy needs of the Australian nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740228_reps_28_hor88/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So now the Minister and the nation have on their hands a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the Post Office which will not be settled easily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this Parliament must be dismayed this afternoon to find that in this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> situation there is no positive approach on the part of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is plenty of evidence that there is a complete failure now even to make a tacit approach to settle this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> with any advantage at all to the public, the nation, or anyone else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since then we have had an energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tragedy of the Whitlam Government is that Australia as a nation is now, as a consequence of misguided government policies and general mismanagement, confronted by crippling inflation and economic instability; a severely impaired defence capability; a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the housing industry, excessively high levels of industrial unrest; a massive erosion in the purchasing power of fixed income earners and pensioners; uncertainty and stagnation in the mineral and oil exploration industries; the highest interest rates in the history of this country; and huge increases in personal income tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Housing today is in a state of very real <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has a positive response to the rapidly developing housing <span class="highlight">crisis</span> but put forward as a general approach because the detailed aspects will be developed elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recent oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and the other things that have happened in the world have all made the task of economic management extremely complicated and highly complex. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not matter that there is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the oil industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the latter part of last year we had an energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> due to circumstances beyond the control of anyone within Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as a result, Australia has been in a more favourable position than most comparable nations during this <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Freights between here and overseas have also increased, in the main because of the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and other costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What restraint this man has in a <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, we have not yet felt the impact of the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which will add at least $1, 250m a year to our international current account bill in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Crisis</span>, chaos, industrial anarchy, communists, fascists, centralists, spendthrifts, misers and a host of other phrases roll glibly off the tongues of these men as they continue on the same path of dividing the nation in Opposition as they did for 23 years in Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Britain is in <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They find that when they can borrow money - there is a shortage of money because the Government has created a liquidity <span class="highlight">crisis</span> - the cost of land has gone up, the cost of building has increased and the amount they borrow leaves a deposit gap between what they have to pay and what they can borrow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The inability to provide housing for those who need it most threatens to reach <span class="highlight">crisis</span> proportions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But now, under the Johnson administration, this area really is in <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an ex-Treasurer of this country who presided over one of our worst economic periods, a man-made <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, he would probably know what he is talking about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also necessary that we recognise the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and the impact that it has had on our trade opportunities, the slackening production rates, the shortages of importable products and the problems of increased costs in shipping and bunkering which affect freight rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> remains basically unresolved and the industrialised nations of the Western world face a further massive dose of cost-price inflation in the coming months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The danger of an oilcrisisinduced balance of payments set-back cannot be discounted lightly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is particularly so because of the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which has meant tremendous suffering to the underdeveloped countries which are not oil producing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This country is escaping from the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> probably better than most other countries because, in a large part, we have our own oil supplies and our balance of payments position is still very good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not in a state of balance of payments <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, and even if we stick to the United States dollar I do not see that we will have a balance of payments problem in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which this Bill is providing funds to assist, will in fact be trying to help the less developed countries offset the problems created for them by the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> by raising loans from the oil producing countries which, of course, will have tremendous surpluses of funds available in the next few years if the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> remains as it is at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My main reason for making a few remarks in this debate is to give some special emphasis to the greatly accelerated and heightened problem that has occurred due to the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mention has been made already of the effects that the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> will have on the balance of payments problems of the industrialised countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is going to cause problems for industrialised countries, then surely the problems that it will pose for the lesser developed countries will be nothing less than devastating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Shah of Iran, of course, is in an extremely fortunate position at the moment because he happens to be the head of government of a country which has done extremely well out of the current oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and perhaps is better placed than Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is interesting to note that the Shah of Iran has suggested the establishment of an international fund to help to overcome the balance of payments problems which underdeveloped countries will experience as a result of the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is really one of great urgency if the underdeveloped countries are not to fall even further behind now that the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> has come upon us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I saw an article the other day which said that India would probably have to absorb something like 80 per cent of its foreign exchange to buy the energy that she requires in the present oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A liquidity <span class="highlight">crisis</span> means a shortage of money in the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has claimed that all primary production is emerging from a period of <span class="highlight">crisis</span> after <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and so it needs some special considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nobody wants to talk to him now because the policies that he enunciated then have proved, in the present world oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, to be the right policies for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At present new great power relationships are emerging, new super power defence concepts are being discussed as SALT II gets under way, the international monetary and trade situation is increasingly complex, the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> has raised new and uncertain problems, and the broader matter of resources and energy intrude more into foreign policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the time of this, his first major visit, to South East Asia - and this is the tenth overseas trip that he has made since he assumed office some 13 months ago - certain parts of Australia were facing a very grave domestic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> caused by flood inundations in Queensland and which was of tremendous importance to the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Minister for Minerals and Energy had allowed the proposition concerning the refining of Mereenie crude gas at Alice Springs to go ahead the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span> would not have arisen because that refinery would have been in operation now and could have produced all the fuel for power generation, motor spirit, aviation gas and liquid petroleum gas required by the Alice Springs and Tennant Creek area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can see little sense, as a politician, in lamenting the actions of past governments as, by and large, it has come through to me that the electorate has a very short memory and that it has forgotten the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> ridden periods of 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The importance of the creation of a new Ministry of Minerals and Energy has been confirmed by the events of 1973 associated with the developing world energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although Australia is in a more fortunate position than most comparable nations in this <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, my Government will not be complacent in planning for the future energy needs of the Australian nation, lt stands ready to join with other nations in search of solutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The speech of the Governor-General captures the seriousness of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> - a threat to the quality of life that should be due to all Australians - and meets it head on with a 3-year program designed to achieve basic changes in the administration and structure of Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely they were not unconscious of the fact that they were creating a very serious <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the housing industry, when in a 2-year period they allowed the money flowing from banks, building societiesand insurance companies to increase by 300 per cent without a comparable increase in the supply of materials or the size of the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At a time of a world energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, we see only pitiful mismanagement, incompetence and lack of foresight by the Minister for Minerals and Energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would take a man of extraordinary administrative incompetence to achieve a situation where there is a sharp reduction in oil exploration at a time of world oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and when Australia’s proven reserves have only a few years to run. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, it could have been a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> for Western Australia where the previous State Liberal governments, with the agreement of the Federal Liberal governments, had ‘abandoned the policy of using local resources in the manufacture of power, with the introduction of oil fired burners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Prime Minister had had the wisdom to include ‘his friend’,  Senator Murphy,  in a 3-man or a 4-man dictatorship, I venture to suggest that we would never have heard of any event called the Murphy Affair, and the Prime Minister would not have faced his first major <span class="highlight">crisis</span> relating to his credibility in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we members on this side of the House query is whether rural subsidies should be built perpetually into the financial structure of this country, enduring long after the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> adduced by Country Party Ministers for Primary Industry as grounds for their introduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is illuminating to consider, for example, that if a rigid system had been established, say, in 1973, it would almost certainly have broken down in the face of the pressures brought about by the recent oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Interest rates are the highest we have ever known, and the Minister and his Government must realise that it was the introduction of higher interest rates that accelerated the housing <span class="highlight">crisis</span> as we know it today among middle and low income earners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no denying that Australia does have a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in housing which has been equalled, if my memory serves me correctly, only by the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the immediate postwar period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was a feeling that because of the Government’s actions the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> would increase rather than the demand be moderated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sixteen months of Labor administration has resulted in a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the Australian housing industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government’s ill-conceived economic policies and its failure to implement a rational housing policy have in large measure created the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But on 14 February this year the national president of the Housing Industry Association - a man with a very sound knowledge of matters relating to this industry which is critical to Australia - warned that this country faced a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in housing not paralleled since the immediate post-war period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us take a look - a hard-headed look - at those policies and disregard temporarily the stupid, doctrinaire Connor approach which long-term threatens our self sufficiency in oil which has enabled us to ride out the prevalent world <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in oil supplies better than most countries in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But we ako got, firstly, access through Esso to technological ability and know-how that was and still is, available to Australia on a limited scale only; secondly, risk capital of $309m from Esso and $189m from the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd without a dollar of taxpayers’ money imperilled, and, thirdly, above all we got the Bass Strait oil and gas fields, a cheap source of supply of crude oil, and the knowledge that on known Australian reserves our supplies are assured until at least the early 1980s, and a position of being one of the few countries in the world unaffected by the recent oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Would any Australian object to a service charge of S20m a year in return for what we got - the savings we made in overseas payments, and the freedom from the recent oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, we regret that the most recent discussions were substantially affected by the recent oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Notwithstanding the immediate problems arising from the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, we welcome the new spirit of flexibility and pragmatism in international monetary negotiations which has arisen as a result of the Rome deliberations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say that this policy is extraordinary because we all know that when the Australian Labor Party took over in December 1972 it was faced with a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> exchange rate position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ball game has also been made very different because of the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now come to the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and what that has caused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed as the Treasurer has said, as it has been said widely in Europe in recent months, anything that had been agreed - supposing that there had been the will to agree - before the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of OctoberNovember last year would have had to be scrapped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole position is of course being aggravated by the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> to which the Treasurer has referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and the impact that this will have on the establishment of some equilibrium, it is quite apparent that the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> has upset - indeed, it has reversed - the pattern to which the Treasurer referred in the beginning of his statement of those currencies which have had a chronic balance of payments problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite apparent that, in the depreciation that some currencies will suffer as a result of the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, there could be a tendency for countries to panic and, at a time when there is no real currency equilibrium, countries like Australia, which as I have explained are still so dependent on having a reasonable currency relativity to those countries with which we trade and with which we are competitors, will need to recognise the impact that marked depreciation can have on our own economic position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe these developing countries, which are essentially dependant on aid flows from the developed countries and which are selling largely unprocessed agricultural commodities, will be very severely affected economically if there should be aggravated currency instability which seems to be emanating from the world oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, developing countries in the world have never faced’ a greater <span class="highlight">crisis</span> than they are facing at present, not merely because of the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, not merely because of oil prices, not merely because of oil inflated prices, but also because of the difficulties that many countries have with nitrogenous fertilisers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that, taking the example of the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that I mentioned, we would have to look again at the nations at whom we are directing our aid, some of whom within the whole context of developing countries will benefit to some extent by the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>While it is true that the net flow of financial resources, to developing countries from the donor countries has increased greatly in size - it amounted to 1971 to $US18,000m - the impact of this expenditure has been undermined to a significant degree by such factors as the world inflationary movement, the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, the international monetary <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and by burgeoning population growth in the developing countries themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A few moments ago, the honourable member for Macarthur  (Mr Kerin)  mentioned the assessment made by the Development Aid Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as to the cost to lesser developed countries of currency changes and the general impact of the present energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and the figure he quoted I think was $10m, presumably American dollars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A major feature of last October’s conflict in the Middle East from our strategic point of view was the manner in which the United States of America and the Soviet Union successfully managed the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in their relations and used their influence to limit the conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This was a time when few people, particularly those in government bodies, could stand up and seek praise for their efforts because it was a time when government authorities - local, State and Federal, had no alternative but to respond to the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of the hour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But it is a recognition of the fact that this organisation was not perfect and that, in responding to the greatest <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which the civil defence authorities have ever had to face, it found that considerable room for improvement existed in a number of fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that the Australian Government will co-operate with the Queensland Government and its civil defence authorities in order to learn from the problems that were faced in the immediate past and so to ensure that in a similar <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the future we will have benefited from that experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not want to delay the House any longer on these events which led to this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the democratic process of this country where the Prime Minister by his action and his colleagues by their actions brought us to a situation in which it was necessary for us to put the question to the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The oil search effort in Australia, in the middle of a world energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, is being cut to ribbons by the blundering attitudes of the Minister and the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless this is done, there will be a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of proportions that could not really be imagined and the hardship that will follow from it will be extreme indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The relief which has been given thus far is only temporary, and the patients and those caring for them in nursing homes are faced with the prospect of going from one <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, from which there has been temporary relief, to another <span class="highlight">crisis</span> as escalation occurs in wages, nurses salaries and food prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The result was that the Liberal Party had a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of confidence within its own ranks and nearly brought its own Prime Minister down on a no confidence motion in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But, quite apart from that, its value in the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span> must be minimal because until the spiralling of prices and wages is stopped the legislation cannot hope to work effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been a belated recognition on the part of the Government, after the honeymoon period of the first 12 months was over, that it was impossible to achieve its aim of a Government takeover in these areas; and I hope there will be a recognition that the Government’s pacesetter policies in wage and salary adjustments have created or helped to create this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in building costs and the salaries of those employed in these places. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is of no use for Government members to talk about the double dissolution retarding the generosity of the Government, because the double dissolution forced it into taking some action to give up, at least for the time being, this ideological approach which was causing this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the field of aged persons homes and nursing homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Had that advice been taken inflation would not have taken off as it did, interest rates need not have been raised to unprecedented levels, income tax collections would not have increased by more than a third, with the prospect of income tax collections this year being double what they were 2 years ago, and the country would not have faced the wage explosion and the economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> it faces today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The suggestion made by  Mr Nixon  (Country Party, Victoria) in the House of Representatives that the proposed increases in postal charges should be deferred until their effects on inflation could be determined is one of the few sane suggestions which has been made in Canberra with regard to the current economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and the shock minibudget designed to deal with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the first crises- it was a period of <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the Labor Party at that time- that confronted Caucus when I was first a member of it was whether we would allow the postal charges to pass in the Budget session. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But exacerbating this, as was also mentioned by the honourable member for Phillip, has been the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and the deeds of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in pushing up the cost of their scarce commodity- the hydrocarbons, the energy and fuel upon which we have become so dependent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which many will find hard to accept because it was only such a very, very short time ago that we could say of Australia, without any fear of contradiction, that it was indeed the lucky country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That there was no loss of life along the Murrumbidgee during the recent record flood is a credit to the State Emergency Service, the flood warning system and the many voluntary organisations including service clubs, rescue clubs, church groups and the Country Womens Association, which helped in the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> as the record peaks moved down the river. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Tales are going around- I am not in a position to say whether they are true or untrue- that the banking liquidity <span class="highlight">crisis</span> has been caused by the Reserve Bank’s charging these quite exorbitant rates to the member banks and that this is a fundamental error in policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I conclude my contribution to the Budget debate by saying that the Labor Government has created that serious economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and that there are some people in the trade union movement with political beliefs of a communist philosophy who are exploiting it to the utmost to bring about that quiet revolution and to destroy free enterprise in this country so that a climate is created where ALP socialism will be the only alternative because private enterprise will no longer be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the answer given earlier today by the Minister for Minerals and Energy, I now ask the Prime Minister: In view of the fact that the Royal Commission detailed no action to overcome fuel shortages quickly through rationalisation of deliveries, will he immediately take action to set up an emergency committee involving the oil companies, distributors and sellers in order to speed deliveries and so protect the livelihood of many Australians affected by this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the areas where fuel supplies are now exhausted? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there is one thing that the speech by the honourable member for Chifley  (Mr Armitage)  has displayed it is his total ignorance of the real <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which is facing Australia at present I go on record as saying, in response to his final comment, that if this Government in fact had the courage to face up to the serious and deteriorating position in Australia’s economic circumstances I have no doubt that the Government would not only deserve but demand the commendation of Australians of all political parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the failure of this Government to face up to the situation which we see at present in the context of higher inflation, higher unemployment and a real <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in capital mobilisation that has produced the current lack of confidence throughout the Australian economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is now a very real <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in capital mobilisation in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Others say that it is not a deliberate policy; it is merely that the Government is impractical and incompetent in government giving rise to this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I say in summary that we have an economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in this country and the root cause of it is the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of confidence the Government has caused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> we have the  Deputy  Prime Minister should become both Treasurer and Prime Minister in this country because, while I would seriously quarrel with his ideological purpose, there is no denying that he is more knowledgeable and attentive m economic and finance matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is one thing which the present economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which the Western world is suffering should teach us it is that we have to improve the productivity to bring about an improvement in our standard of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the greatest <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that has ever been experienced in this industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its discussions to be held soon with the Japanese Prime Minister, will the Government firmly point out the damaging effects which Japanese attitude is having on the Australian cattle industry which faces a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of extremely serious proportions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time I said that if the cyclical downturn in the Western economies which was being predicted by the best economists in the Western world occurred and if the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> remained unsolved there was no way that the ripples from these 2 effects would not wash Australia’s shores as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently it was an early casualty of the international oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, because it never even got mobile. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation that exists at the moment is nowhere near as bad as it was in the depths of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> while the Opposition was in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe there is a great risk in Australians accepting high levels of unemployment and inflation and the economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to examine the reasons for unemployment One reason is the economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, the credit squeeze. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the history of this nation, when the people have been called upon to face times of <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, the Australian characteristic of a fair go for all has come to the fore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Labor Government is being condemned yet again by the Premier of South Australia for its lack of policies and its inability to deal with the economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that faces this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We now have industry views on what should be done to alleviate the position and to alleviate the disastrous <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which is now confronting this industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Companies should be allowed to defer the payment of tax and revert to the original basis of taxation while this particular <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is upon them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in this industry which is undergoing a particular <span class="highlight">crisis</span> liquidity is vital and anything that the Government can do to increase that liquidity to alleviate the problems of the beef industry will certainly be well received by the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present the only part of the meat industry where reasonable prices prevail is in the pig meat industry, but for all parts of the Australian meat industry there is emerging a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which needs to be recognised by all members of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is perfectly true that the principal reason for the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the beef industry today is the collapse of the world price of beef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, let us make it very clear indeed that the principal <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is due to the collapse of the overseas markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Detailed papers are all very well, but they will not help in the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span> situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the present situation, as I mentioned a moment ago, is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Government has a responsibility to negotiate access to markets, that will not help cope with this <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We accept without question that the beef industry is entering and has in fact entered a very serious <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia should be more concerned with an overall analysis of the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span>- or in popular jargon, with the recycling of petro-dollars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia should be more concerned with our relationships with Japan in terms of the economic consequences of the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> than attempting to try some form of blackmail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-There is no doubt that the export cattle industry in northern Australia is facing a financial <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a world energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and there is, in various countries, varying degrees of <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in terms of crude oil availability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, its smallness and the smallness of the sum it intends to spend are no measure of the importance of this Department because it has the role of trying to draw attention to the greatest <span class="highlight">crisis</span> facing modern man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Indeed, when we look at the greatest problem that confronts us- the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>- I do not think there is any reliable evidence to indicate that the solutions that are being suggested for the problem of the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> will not produce worse problems than those the solutions seek to overcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I intend to speak in particular about the beef situation because the beef industry in Australia is in a state of absolute <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, as is the wool industry to a certain extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is ironic that restraints on this particular activity, so important now in this particular <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, have the complete consensus of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in Australia- mounting unemployment and price rises, with worse in sight- and his admitted lack of expertise in economic matters, and as the Prime Minister has often prided himself on being a good Australian, will he now serve the best interests of the country by stepping down as Prime Minister to make way for the  Deputy  Prime Minister,  Dr J.  F. Cairns, the only Labor Minister who takes a close and consistent interest in the critical economic areas of government responsibility? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As members of this House recognise and realise not only Australia but the whole of the world is going through a fuel and energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and if the aircraft that are being acquired by Qantas, TAA and Ansett have a higher carrying capacity it should be possible for fewer trips to be made or fewer schedules to be operated as between say, the major capital cities- Melbourne to Brisbane, Melbourne to Sydney, Sydney to Melbourne and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will remember my saying in December of last year that if the economic downturn- the cyclical downturn- in Western economies, which was then being confidently predicted by all of the economic experts around the world, in fact eventuated and if the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> remained unresolved there was no way that the ripples of inflation and unemployment which would follow in the wake of these events in the Western economies would not lap our shores as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There the Government determined that it would give a certain amount of money to endeavour to meet the world food <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, not on the basis of guide lines laid down in this Parliament or at the Conference itself, but simply because Canada had decided to give in excess of $30m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is no wonder the Premier of Queensland described the Premiers’ Conference on 13 August 1974 as a complete waste of time because the Commonwealth did not have a plan and the Prime Minister, who admits he has neither interest nor expertise in economic matters said there was not a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I yet hope that I can persuade him to accept the view with respect to recurrent grants that there is a very real <span class="highlight">crisis</span> facing schools throughout Australia and that some of the non-government schools are in a position of almost total collapse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Althouth I would agree that nongovernment schools are facing some <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in relation to finance, I stress that it is my experience in my own electorate that the parish schools and the regional colleges I have visited are delighted that at this time they are receiving much more in the recurrent expenditure area than they have ever received before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This situation is creating a very serious <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in non-government schools, but these distress letters that we get, whether they are from Catholic, Anglican or any other type of school, invariably come from the State of New South Wales because the State of New South Wales, which has had a long term Liberal Government, acknowledges no obligation towards them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the 6 months since the May election this Government has failed to take the economic decisions required to avoid the current <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, the economic measures consistently pressed by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-34-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, this bank of which  Mr Prowse  is the Assistant General Manager, because of the severe liquidity <span class="highlight">crisis</span> it found itself in and because it did not read the signs- the Commonwealth Bank and the National Bank did and they knew just what was occurring; they had the economic advisers on their staff to advise them and accordingly did not get any problems- had to go into the short term money market and borrow at rates as high as 18 per cent because its own liquidity margin had fallen below the 1 8 per cent traditional margin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I said then that this cyclical downturn in addition to the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, if it remained unresolved, would inevitably cause an economic downturn in this country because it was not possible for us to become an economic island, to live alone in the world and not be affected by the ripples coming from the shores of other countries which were badly affected by inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not suggesting this as a permanent feature of policy but we are in a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> situation and unusual and imaginative policies are required to deal with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the debate on this subject last October the Government reviewed the action which had been taken to that date in regard to the serious <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the beef industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That Committee established close liaison with the cattle industry as soon as the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> started. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that 80 per cent of world imports of beef are accounted for by these 2 markets in which Australia has already established a very firm base and in which the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is politically motivated in order to protect the interests of the domestic meat producers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are considering extended hours of sitting on certain days with a legislative program that is uncertain and in an economic climate that is at <span class="highlight">crisis</span> point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am not for one minute suggesting that in a time of <span class="highlight">crisis</span> such as this the situation ought to be under the sole control of the local executive, but we did state something which ought to be borne in mind continually. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The contemporary <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in family relationships results from a large variety of factors including changes in the social philosophy which are emphasising increasingly the freedom of the individual to develop his own philosophy of life and the freedom of the individual to acquire the tools for an analysis of problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as the allegation about blackmail is concerned, we are concerned to have tankers so that if there is an oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> at some time or another involving other countries whose tankers normally would be carrying Australia’s crude oil we will be in a position, if need be, to deal with the suppliers of crude overseas on a nation to nation basis using Australian tankers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The policy actions of the Whitlam Government have led to an investment <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the Australian economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This investment <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is serious. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For well over a year evidence of the investment <span class="highlight">crisis</span> has been building up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The time allowed for this debate does not permit a detailed analysis of the reasons for the present investment <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, during this period of <span class="highlight">crisis</span>- the world inflationary situation- we have been cushioned or should have been cushioned from the ramifications of the world trading patterns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an investment <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and it is beside the point to talk of overseas causes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One sees that there has been some recognition of this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> by the Government when one remembers its recent reversals of its policies and its newfound respect for the private sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government has only partially recognised this <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, especially in respect of the liquidity problems to which the  Deputy  Prime Minister referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is really the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which we now have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to bring on a debate and to take up the time of this House by suggesting there have not been effective remedies to overcome the private sector investment <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, socalled, when one can read out a list of about 1 5 remedies, all of which have been effective in overcoming the fact that private investment is less than it ought to be, is, I repeat, to take up the time of this House unnecessarily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is stubbornly unwilling, perhaps emotionally unable, to see a situation not as superficial and temporary but as a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of the system itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no exaggeration to say that the blame for the accelerating inflation and the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that exists in this country lies directly at the feet of the Prime Minister and the members of the Labor Party, only five of whom are present even to sit in on this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The eastern seaboard of the United States of America has been talked about for many years- particularly recently in the light of the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span>- as being highly prospective for oil and gas exploration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The beef industry is suffering its worst liquidity <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of this century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It said that the unrelated problems which emerged from this collapse could be summed up as a continuing build-up in cattle numbers, depressed producer income, liquidity <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, and reduced credit availability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government does not seem to realise that there is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition only regrets that the Government knows so little about the problems that are seriously besetting this industry that it provides such minimal help at a time of <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So obviously this is getting close to a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Northern Development: When does the Government intend to assist effectively cattle producers in Australia to overcome the greatest financial <span class="highlight">crisis</span> this industry has ever experienced? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Let me put the point that this power would be exercised only in a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> situation, which the honourable gentleman has himself admitted could arise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is the Minister who has betrayed the Australian working man by presiding over the worst unemployment <span class="highlight">crisis</span> since the Great Depression, the Minister whose policies and those of his colleagues have directly led to in excess of 300 000 people unemployed in Australia at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People in these industries are now finding themselves in a very serious <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now the Government, in its usual fashion, waits for the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and then moves, and moves ponderously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Is the Minister for Labor and Immigration aware of a special <span class="highlight">crisis</span> among woodchip loggers and bushmen in Tasmania in that many loggers with costly trucks and equipment worth from $50,000 to $150,000 have become unemployed because the 3 woodchip companies in Tasmania have had their exports to Japan drastically reduced by the Japanese paper companies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because this woodchip <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is unique to Tasmania can he make special arrangements to help these out of work hauliers to stay solvent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be that the 1970s will be the decade in which we see people around the world deciding to go back to rail, not only because of the efficiency it can provide in shifting freight and passengers but also because of the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To accentuate further the backward thinking in these days of an energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and of air pollution problems in our cities I point out that a Western Australian report has contemplated the abolition of metropolitan rail services and recommended the utilisation of buses instead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The political lesson is simple in theory, but difficult to apply: We approach <span class="highlight">crisis</span> as an independent nation, attempting to exercise our own judgment in the best interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Treasurer said that deficit budgeting financed by money creation would end only when unemployment eases, but we have the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of greater unemployment facing us in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have people leaving the industry daily and we have bankruptcies throughout the land because the Australian building industry today is in a greater state of <span class="highlight">crisis</span> than has ever been known since the great depression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will also be advantaged by the fact that they have an Australian Labor Party Government on the Treasury bench in Canberra which is prepared to take initiatives in a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in contrast to those honourable members who sit opposite and who in every desperate downturn when in government failed to be effective in discharging their responsibilities to the home seeking public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the discontent and disillusionment of the people of Darwin at all levels- a feeling that is reaching <span class="highlight">crisis</span> point and constantly being expressed through the’ honourable member for the Northern Territory and myself- will the Minister inform the House why the rebuilding of the residential areas of Darwin is making little progress? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The result of all this is extreme fluctuations in work loads and, under the complicated arrangements that are inherent in the present scheme, these are producing <span class="highlight">crisis</span> situations in the Australian Government Retirement Benefits Office and organisations employing large numbers of staff, such as the Post Office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From the time of the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> when the increase in the price of oil had such a tremendous impact upon the economies of European and North American countries, the problem of inflation, and with it unemployment, as one is interacting against the other, has been a difficulty which all of those countries have had to face. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Interim Committee claims that in most instances in which it was called upon to make recommendations on <span class="highlight">crisis</span> issues it was able to arrange or recommend a solution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Interim Committee drew attention in other parts of its report to the importance of public involvement, it is somewhat surprising that it failed to list those items that came before it as <span class="highlight">crisis</span> issues which it did not succeed in solving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister succeeded in obtaining funds to preserve an adequate buffer zone so that this unique geological feature in South Australia- a science laboratory in its own right- can be preserved, or will we go on spending more money in <span class="highlight">crisis</span> circumstances, because the longer this is left, the more expensive it will become? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in which we find ourselves is not merely the result of fortuitous circumstances; it is primarily the result of the misdirection of policies initiated by the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and the world-wide inflation have made the normally uncertain life of a shipowner and a shipbuilder even more hazardous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has only to search one’s memory and to think of the case of the Evans Deakin company: My God, when I was first reading about the shipbuilding industry, probably 15 years ago, Evans Deakin was in a state of perennial <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When I first came into this Parliament in 1970, one of the first debates that I heard was on the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> at Evans Deakin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 2 shipbuilding yards which do particularly well, which do not complain and limp and stagger from one <span class="highlight">crisis</span> to another, are BHP at Whyalla in South Australia and the State Dockyards at Newcastle in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is working better than ever before and better than it did under the former Government when the shipbuilding industry limped from one <span class="highlight">crisis</span> to another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One clear consequence of the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> has been the growing trend of the now enormously affluent Middle East oil exporting countries to seek comprehensive, long-term, government to government arrangements on agricultural development, foodstuffs, capital equipment and technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has created a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of confidence in which long-term investment- especially risk investment- is no longer prudent or warranted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For well over 18 months evidence of the investment <span class="highlight">crisis</span> has been building up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidence of the investment slump has at the same time been consistently ignored by the Government as in fact it is ignoring that <span class="highlight">crisis</span> at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe the floor price of wool has highlighted this fact, not in a time of <span class="highlight">crisis</span> but in a time of normal supply and demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the wool industry, with market uncertainty, seasonal unpredictability and the cost increases induced by Labor caused inflation, the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> ahead is such that we certainly cannot bear that sort of practice once more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then, the beef <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, of course, also has seriously affected farmers’ incomes as the sale of calves and cull cows is now returning significantly less money than it did before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can go back even to December 1973, when a lot of people who should have known better went on record criticising me for saying then that 1974 would be a year of rising unemployment, that it had to happen because of the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the Western economies and because of the downturn in economic activities in the countries that are our chief trading partners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of the borrowings, as set out in the explanatory memoranda for the Executive Council, was to meet the needs of the Australian Government for ‘substantial sums of non-equity capital from abroad for temporary purposes, amongst other things to deal with exigencies arising out of the current world situation and the international energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, to strengthen Australia’s external financial position, to provide immediate protection for Australia’s supplies of minerals and energy and to deal with current and immediately foreseeable unemployment in Australia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-91-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there is some substance to the arguments which the Press has brought forward and which have produced a situation of <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, as there is today within the Labor Party and the Government as a result of the Government trying to conceal or hide the facts from the Australian people, this Government and individuals in it are deserving of whatever criticism they get from the Press. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-139-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They obtained Executive Council approval to go overseas and raise $2,000m on the assumption that the money was to be used for temporary purposes, that it was to be used to enable Australia to meet its balance of payments commitments, that it was to be used in respect of the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in our country and that it was to be used in regard to unemployment But today we are told by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Minerals and Energy that this money is to be used for long term investment in the electrification of railways, in port facilities, in the development of gas, in the development of coal and in the development of the hydrogenation of coal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-139-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has not solved the medical <span class="highlight">crisis</span> now and, by moving the allocation of some of the $1.7m extra forward from the end of the next triennium to the beginning of that triennium, he will only accentuate another medical research <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in 1978, the last year of the 1976-78 triennium, without solving the medical <span class="highlight">crisis</span> at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is what the Government has to consider because today the people of this country had expectations that the Government in its third Budget would have learnt from the mistakes of its last 2 Budgets and would have had the courage to take real decisions which are so necessary if this nation is to get out of the current <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of the highest inflation in Australia’s history and the highest rate of unemployment since the Depression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the failure of the Budget to alleviate the circumstances of cattle producers and people living in these areas and the fact that the Government has not acted on 3 Industries Assistance Commission reports that have been published and which affect cattle producers, will the Minister undertake to negotiate with his colleagues responsible for the Industries Assistance Commission to have the report of the IAC on the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the beef industry completed and published as soon as possible? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that if the Constitution had been drawn up about 12 or 15 years later than it was the situation we have at the moment would not have occurred, because about 1910 or 1911 after a constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the United Kingdom the House of Lords had the power to refuse money taken away from it- or it agreed by virtue of the circumstances that it could not refuse money to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one really looks at what the Government’s allocation of that $24m has done, it can be seen that it will mean another <span class="highlight">crisis</span> for medical research in 1978, that is, if medical research survives the immediate <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of the first 6 months of 1 976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even if the triennium allocation is considered adequate- ‘adequate’ would be the strongest word one could use and then I think one would still be exaggerating- the triennium planning is theoretically continued but that may be of no value if the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, that is the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in medical research that will be with us in the first 6 months of 1 976, is not resolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This kind of tax on consuming nations is the very antithesis of the developing international economic relations since the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of October 1973.

    <p>This Government has presided over the worst inflation, the worst unemployment, the worst industrial strife and the worst economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> this nation has known since Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But when he says that the Labor Government has induced an equipment <span class="highlight">crisis</span> within the Services, I think that is just simply nonsense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the population growth in this countryof course, there are certain disabilities in regard to the trends and where those trends move to- before the economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that this Government created, we were getting some evenness in the non-metropolitan growth in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I know that he deserves most of the blame for bringing the mining industry in Australia to its present state of confusion, <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and uncertainty, but the Minister is a member of a government which has approved, even praised, all that he has done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By bringing confusion and <span class="highlight">crisis</span> to the mining industry the Government can more easily gain control of those industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in energy in Australia is fast approaching. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the difficulties which Australia faces today in relation to its constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is not that we need to review the Constitution but rather that we need the mechanism to change it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Australia faces a Budget deficit this year which threatens to bring on a renewed economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and which is a further reflection of this Government’s monopoly of disaster and deceit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment, this nation faces a certain difficulty- a constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, if honourable members like- and the question that arises is: Who governs Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would, in my respectful opinion (and in this I am expressing the majority view among reputable lawyers in this State), have been nothing short of a calamity if during the very great constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, New South Wales had possessed a Governor who had subordinated the constitutional authority of a Governor to the purely opportunist demands of those who found the constitutional restrictions irksome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>And this, with a prescience, prophetic insight, that Quick and Garran would not have claimed for themselves, gets to the heart and the root of this present grave <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The unbridled ambition of the Leader of the Opposition, a man who has destroyed two friendsone a Prime Minister and the other a Leader of the Opposition- has pushed this country to the brink of the most serious constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span> since Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having created the greatest constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in Australian history the Opposition has now unleashed forces that nobody can effectively control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today we stand in the centre of a grave constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that threatens to destroy the fragile fabric of the democracy that holds our nation together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that has been engineered by a man bent on getting power at any cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because of the inspiration given by the Prime Minister in this present <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, the man who in this Parliament stands out like a giant against the intellectual and moral pygmies who sit opposite him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have appreciated it if he had told the Parliament in his speech, which immediately preceded mine, that, after  Mr Menzies-  he was not then  Sir Robertthe  Prime Minister of Australia had been given the important task by the British Government of negotiating with  Colonel Nasser  following the Suez Canal <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, he came back to this Parliament or he had printed in a book that in Egypt  Colonel Nasser-  the honourable member for Bradfield served as a diplomat in Egypt and would be more aware of this fact than any member of the House, but withheld it from his speech- was virtually in charge of a police state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So desperate for power is the Opposition that it is prepared to plunge Australia into a constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of frightening proportions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present <span class="highlight">crisis</span> caused by the action of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and those in the Senate who have been prepared to follow him is in the grand line of the great constitutional struggles of the past- of 1640, 1688, 1 832 and 1 9 10. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This must be emphasised: In this grave constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, this crucial dispute between the 2 Houses, none of the electoral options available are in any way relevant to the issue at stake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well known that the Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  said in Caucus only 2 weeks ago that every major <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that the Party had confronted was caused by its Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that all honourable gentlemen and ladies, irrespective of their views, will concede that that was a date when there was no <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, as has been described by members on both sides of the House and indeed by every editorial observer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throughout the last few days we have had nothing in this country but people on the other side, on public platforms and in this House, creating a situation of grave fear and grave <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no <span class="highlight">crisis</span> whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in this country at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am saying is that honourable members opposite have been creating fear in this community when there is no constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the dominant reason given by the Leader of the Opposition for inducing the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span> atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But more to the point, the so-called <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that we face today has been brought about because of the constant deceit, because of the running away from reality, because of those who sit opposite who will not face the fact that there are persons, if not one very important person, party principal to the negotiations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite talk about a constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span> provided for by the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They know that it is a fraud and that it is akin to the actions they have been taking throughout their period in government and more particularly, that it is along the lines of the loans affair and loans <span class="highlight">crisis</span> with which we are faced today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of the highest order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The longer the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> drags on, the more repetition we will inevitably have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we say that the country is bordering on the brink of a political and economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, people having heard that so often will tend to brush it aside, discount it, and say: ‘Well, that is merely a cliche.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly to speak today of the country being on the brink of a political and economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is self-evidently true. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even last night, I understand, because of the support given and because of the money being spent the Leader of the Opposition was on the telephone to a senior executive from News Limited giving that gentleman a personal account of his talks with the Governor-General on the constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the unfortunate things about a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> like this is that it does not bring out the best in human beings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Nothing could be more reckless or inappropriate at this time of delicate economic recovery than to precipitate a political <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present <span class="highlight">crisis</span> has been brought about by a blind lack of reason, a headlong rush in pursuit of power, the singleminded abandonment of principle by one man in too great a hurry to grasp a destiny which many would agree does not belong to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>None of the quiet tedium that we have heard from the honourable gentleman today can hide the simple fact that this country is, and has been for some considerable period, in a position of economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and chaos; that this chaos has been perpetrated by the Labor Government of which he is now the most senior Minister with financial responsibility; that the Government does not have the policies or the capacity to resolve the problems which mount as the days and months go by; and that this Government should resign while it still retains a modicum of respectability throughout the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Opposition’s view it is the refusal of the Prime Minister to face his makers that is causing the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet the first item, the first Bill which the Opposition delayed in the Senate in respect to this constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span> was a Bill the purpose of which is to provide finance for our defence expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>(Quorum formed)  As I said, the Opposition, which gives great lip service to the issue of defence, chose as the first item of legislation which it delayed in the Senate in respect of this constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that we have today a Bill to provide finance for our defence expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>(Quorum formed)  The honourable member for Evans made the point that every 18 months we faced a <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, but we have faced a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> every 6 months because there have been threats from the Senate to withdraw Supply every 6 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Businessmen have been hesitating for several weeks in their investment decisions because they could see the impending <span class="highlight">crisis</span> building up as a result of the recurrent statements, the recurrent threats, the intimidation of the Opposition in terms of what was going to happen to the Appropriation Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the meantime they ought to face up to the real issue that is confronting this country- the constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span> for which they are responsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendment goes further and charges the Opposition with putting the living standards of the needy in great jeopardy because of the constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which it has promoted in this Parliament and in this country today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To propose a resolution in this House stating that our problems of inflation are due to economic mismanagement is spurious nonsense, as it is nonsense for the Leader of the Opposition (  Mr Malcolm  Fraser) to give as one of his main reasons for promoting the constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span> from which we are suffering in this country today, the state of the economy of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as long as the Opposition turns us into another Portugal, which is the sort of thing that is happening in the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which it has created, there will be no cure, there will be no stability, there will be no hope for the Australian people to steadily overcome this world malaise from which we are suffering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The best answer that I think can be given to the honourable gentleman’s question about the capacity of  Mr Gruzman  to express the opinion that he expressed on the constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span> was delivered in the  Australian  newspaper by Professor Blackshield who gave that answer in a very learned article published in the  Australian  newspaper this morning, I think, and who on Sunday gave a talk in the capacity of  Guest of Honour  for the Australian Broadcasting Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is important that the people of Australia recognise that it is absolutely vital that this matter should be considered in the context of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of confidence which has emerged from the actions of the Government in respect of the dismissals of the honourable member for Lalor  (Dr J.

Cairns)  and the honourable member for Cunningham  (Mr Connor);  the refusal of the Government to answer questions in this House about the loan-raising activities; and the refusal of the Government to tell us the circumstances of the involvement of the Reserve Bank of Australia in these loan-raising negotiations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation is to that extent the victim of the domestic economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which is occurring in Australia, no part of which has effectively been imported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the question is why has this matter suddenly erupted in the Parliament at a time when the Parliament is in the grip of constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, at a time when the Opposition has a special visitor- a privileged visitor; its star performer in Australia-  Mr Khemlani. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime, while the Opposition is trying to evade the real issues which are convulsing this country- the constitutional crisisand while the loans affair drags on in its wearisome and uninformative way, the only casualties of the Opposition’s irresponsible behaviour are the ardours of people crushed by the false innuendoes of the Leader of the Opposition and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition and the loss of economic momentum which this nation is suffering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>You are the people who are presenting a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> to the social and economic fabric of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of resolving this issue, instead of facing up to the reality that the irresponsible behaviour of the Opposition is bringing this country to a halt, is precipitating a situation of social and economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, the Opposition spends its time threshing about like a whale that has been beached, looking for some sort of escape from the trap that it has set for itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the circumstances therefore I again plead -  (Quorum formed)  Once again I make a plea to the Opposition that it draw back from the brink of economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> to which it is pushing this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is conceivable if the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span> continues much longer that, as my friend the Minister for Administrative Services  (Mr Daly)  has pointed out, we may provide members of Parliament with an airline ticket to Canberra but not be able to provide them one to leave Canberra until the Appropriation Bills are passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They know that it is a fact that the Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  said in their Party room a few weeks ago that every major <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that has been caused, has been caused by the Prime Minister himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was a change of heart by the Cabinet but the decision was reversed in the Caucus in a substantial manner following a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> spread over about 4 days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the season progressed the market strengthened considerably and in the last 3 months of the season the Corporation’s purchases averaged only 10 per cent of offering and at one stage in June, just before the temporary <span class="highlight">crisis</span> over the guaranteed price, the Corporation was buying only 3 per cent of the total wool at sales in late May or early June of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the normal sittings that were planned for the House the Bill would not have been dealt with until the week commencing 19 November, but because of the stupidity over the constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span> the matters set down for later in the parliamentary session have had to be brought forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think those who want to make union bashing more selective ought at least to give some credit to the fact that in this country at this time of economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> trade unions have adopted a far more responsible approach as a result of the exhortations of this Government than has been evident at any time I can remember since the war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet through all the months during which he was working himself up to take the plunge, through all the weeks of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> he has created, he has never before taken the course which would bring on a debate of no confidence in or censure of the Government or on any Minister- on this issue, on the Budget itself or on any of the pseudo-issues which were to be used to justify the extraordinary conduct of the Opposition and the unconstitutional conduct of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is His Excellency- to find a democratic and constitutional solution to the current <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which will permit the people of Australia to decide as soon as possible what should be the outcome of the deadlock which developed over supply between the two Houses of Parliament and between the Government and the Opposition parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>By the manner in which he discharged that task- by the manner in which he carried out his duties, throughout his term as  Speaker  and during the gravest <span class="highlight">crisis</span> ever confronted by the Parliament- the honourable member brought credit and dignity to his office, and earned, as no  Speaker  has before him, the right to continue in the chair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the root of the economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is a steadily increasing tax burden required to finance, at the expense of the private sector, an ever-growing public sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Alongside its assistance to manufacturing and other industries, the Government has taken action to assist the rural community to overcome its present <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that we should keep this matter under consideration and allocate finance or assistance as it is necessary and in time to prevent a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> situation from developing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> I made one or two speeches here round that theme in which I indicated that really it is nonsense for a government to be in a situation of having permanent public servants, legally employed, whom it cannot sack but because of a failure to get a piece of legislation through, not being able to pay them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The suggestion made by the honourable member for Darling that the Parliament should give greater consideration to members of electorates concerned in times of <span class="highlight">crisis</span> should be taken a great deal further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is important to the people and at times of <span class="highlight">crisis</span> the member has a responsibility to be in his electorate and the Parliament and the Government should make available such facilities as are necessary to a member in such circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While I was there in the anteroom, waiting upon the Governor-General and the then Prime Minister who were having discussions, the GovernorGeneral ‘s private secretary,  Mr David  Smith, said in conversation to me that they already had a plan to solve the constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Second World War commenced, America was about nineteenth on the list of countries in armed strength, and managed from this base to get through a very great <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which it otherwise might not have overcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The recovery would be stimulated also by the improvement in consumer confidence consequent upon the resolution of the constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, the impact of easy money and lower interest rates and the flow on of high levels of activity in housing to consumer expenditure on associated items. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, the  Speaker  had an important message to the effect that the House had noted that the Supply <span class="highlight">crisis</span> was over, that the House had no confidence in the caretaker Prime Minister,  Mr Malcolm  Fraser, and that the House in fact reaffirmed its confidence in  Mr Whitlam  as Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely, as Laski went on to write, the mere fact that we do not know the limits of the royal power, that it remains to be invoked on one side or the other in the twilight zone of <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, is sufficient evidence to indicate the difficulties of the position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we can see, in any case, is that neocapitalism, with its pretensions to have found the answer to Marx, was the expression of a temporary situation, borne along not by its own dynamic but by the upwards wave of the economic cycle; but the vision of a society dedicated to welfare, not to power and profit- the only vision that makes sense in today ‘s circumstances- still eludes us, and will do so until another <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, even more crippling than the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that is brewing today, brings home to the whole world the perils it faces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know very well that the performance of the other countries to which the honourable member for Gellibrand referred has been relatively much better than Australia’s performance, even bearing in mind that each of the other industrialised countries was subject to the consequences of the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> when we were 70 per cent self-sufficient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one thinks back to 1970, the real <span class="highlight">crisis</span> for the States at that time was the enormous interest bill, the enormous debt sinking fund requirement, and the disproportionate situation between the States and the Commonwealth Government in relation to the Commonwealth’s part in the annual expenditure of funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Either those on the other side believe that there was no constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span>; either they believe that the GovernorGeneral at any time can willy-nilly dismiss the government of the day- a government properly elected, properly in office, never having acted illegally- or they must concede that there was a constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that had to be resolved by the Governor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Added employment of Australian citizens, particularly during the present unemployment <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, the royalties and taxes extracted, together with the foreign exchange generated by exports, are all benefits to Australia and far exceed the profits enjoyed by foreign investors, no matter what is the amount of their equity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that the concern which the honourable member has expressed with respect to their income from vegetable growing might extend to their overall economic circumstances, for many growers in that area are subjected to an extraordinary drop in income to far below average weekly earnings, simply because of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the dairy industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the contrary, a scheme like the current one which is production orientated gives the larger grower a larger proportion of the funds available and the smaller grower receives only a small amount of the funds available which, in many cases, just becomes a form of welfare assistance rather than viable support to take growers over the hump of any particular <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not the sort of welfare initiative which gets votes but it is the sort of welfare initiatives which satisfies one greatly because one realises that one has discharged a very important moral obligation in society to do something for the very serious social casualties that we do have in our community, and to help the very worthwhile people who dedicate their lives to helping the men and women who are homeless and who are drifting in the community, often in a situation of that nature because of some sort of <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that has occurred in their life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The traditional signs of economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the rural sector are with us: The destruction of livestock, some form of Government help to impoverished small farmers, and severe unemployment in country towns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a matter of record that the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which obtained in the world in recent years had a significant effect on the economies of a large number of the trading nations of the world, particularly amongst the OECD countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That turn around of something in excess of US$35 billion is representative of the effect largely of the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and the actions of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in pursuing the policy on the pricing of oil that they chose to pursue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, I think, one of those examples of significant international co-operation in the field of trade that Australia, in concert with other member countries of the OECD, is prepared to undertake commitments which will assist the world as a trading entity to see that the effects of the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> will not be too long term and will not cause significant degrees of disruption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian economy is significantly dependent on overseas trade and obviously in our economic considerations we have a vested interest in seeing that trade is allowed to continue on a stable and growing basis and that we do not have significant disruptions in the pattern of world trade as a result of events such as the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is designed by the OECD to meet the problems of particular countries in overcoming the domestic problems that might arise as a result of the actions of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries which caused what is generally called the ‘oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span>’ of the last couple of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think it is a credit to the OECD that it has been able to negotiate an arrangement which will work to the benefit of its members, an arrangement which will enable the member nations of the OECD, should they have a problem arising from the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, to have that problem satisfied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The particular <span class="highlight">crisis</span> facing the industry today has been caused by these contracting markets in addition to a huge increase in dairy farmers’ production costs and in factory costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia has argued strongly within the present series of MTN discussions, as well as bilaterally, for increased liberalisation of import trade barriers and domestic dairy support and export regimes, especially by the EEC, Japan, Canada and the United States whose dairy policies collectively have been a major factor in the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the world dairy market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-54-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again it took the  Australian Financial Review  to bring to light the fact that BHP had put in a submission which, in effect, asked the Government to dump the shipbuilding industry, asked the Government to give BHP the opportunity to take short term advantage of the record depression that exists in world shipbuilding yards and which followed the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the Government is most concerned not only that there is a marketing <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the dairying industry but also that the production downturn flowing from dry conditions across most of southern Australia has led to an even lower expectation of production this year than was earlier indicated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever the reason, Whitlam retreated to the Lodge for many weeks and his Government was left without strong leadership, in a rudderless condition, shining from <span class="highlight">crisis</span> to <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, being discredited each day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#subdebate-13-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Throughout our economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> the Government’s chief weapon has been the lie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#subdebate-13-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That distortion allowed the Senate to vote to defer Supply- a vote which could not have been passed if the late  Senator Milliner  had been replaced by a Labor Party senator- and to bring on the instability and <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in November and December 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The two honourable members from the Opposition side who have spoken suggested that the answers are simple and that it is easy to overcome the unemployment <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister has mentioned a number of anomalies that occur when employers who appear to be genuine people are saying that there is no unemployment <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and they cannot get people to fill jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An initial reaction might be that he would do better to devote whatever intellectual capacity he may have to making some contribution towards the solution of the country’s worsening economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> rather than to verse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Beef <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is a social and economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span>’, says Ian Sinclair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are facing now is a massive social <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in some sections of the beef industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So let us talk about what should be done to help this nation in a <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, which is what we now have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice, towards the end of the table, a break from 1954 to 1971 without any <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The occasion in 1971 was a very serious <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They indicate a complete social <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the countryside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment we have an economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which we inherited from our predecessor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is yet another aspect of the national credibility <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As our economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and our national <span class="highlight">crisis</span> deepens there will be more attacks on living standards, more unemployment, more pressure on the wages of ordinary breadwinners and families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, with the dual trends of higher production costs and shrinking export markets, the industry now is facing continuing social <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because of this social <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that the Opposition seeks to amend the legislation to help maintain the real incomes of growers and to secure adjustment within the industry that may allow it better to tailor its production to available markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The industry is facing a critical export <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The approach of the Government in not accepting the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission, in not putting forward a positive plan for a rationalisation of the industry, has left growers in a subsistence situation in which they face a continuing social <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But now they are approaching a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> position and they are very much dependent on their Tasmanian representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the financial <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of that year, which precipitated the fall of the Labour Government headed by Prime Minister James Ramsay MacDonald, the King followed strict constitutional practice and sought to determine a future government for Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe our Governor-General could well have been praying during October and early November 1975 that the political and constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which existed in this country would resolve itself at Parliament House so that he could avoid involvement in controversy, but when it did not, he was bound to act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One cannot blame the present Leader of the Opposition  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  for holding out in the hope that the then Opposition senators would abandon their stand, but in retrospect even the most politically biased must admit his proposal for a half-Senate election would have simply served to prolong the national <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and agony. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that this country faces, irrespective of whether it has a monarchy or is a republic, without a vast constitutional amendment, is simply the question summed up so eloquently by  Sir Robert  Garran when he quoted what J. W. Hackett once said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people of Australia must be reminded or, even more drastically, jolted out of their apathy in relation to the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a belief abroad that those people who talk about an Australian energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> are eco-nuts pushing some hobby horse; that they are people who were frightened by a motor car at birth or who have some masochistic desire to ride bicycles around the countryside in the rain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is facing a <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, not because we are poor in resources but because our ‘mix’ of different resources does not match our ‘mix’ of projected demand, both as to the type of energy resources required and to the geographic location of the available resources within this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After an unprecedented world economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in 1974 and continuing into 1975- something which happened not only in Australia but also in every comparable country- we had a slow but sure return to economic health taking place about IS months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Then this country was plunged by the Liberal and National Country Parties into a political <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In using the comparative figures related to the December quarter of 1975, these Fraser Government leaders are seeking to persuade us to forget that they are making comparisons with an economic quarter in which thenown abominable actions created a political and economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need to face the facts that the slow but steady recovery from the world economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, which was under way when the Liberal and National Country Parties usurped power, was halted by consecutive policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the root of the economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is a steadily increasing tax burden required to finance, at the expense of the private sector, an ever-growing public sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Measures to deal with this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> will advance Australia towards the long-term goal of a society based on freedom and on the mutual respect freedom makes possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the increase in the cost of goods imported from Japan, America and western Europe, Australia was reasonably insulated from the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear that Australia could face its energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the next decade rather than in this one unless appropriate action is taken to prepare for likely massive increases in oil costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely when one hears the sorts of questions asked here, particularly by the group which is not represented in the chamber at the moment, the National Country Party, about what it calls the beef <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, we perhaps should adopt new and novel methods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Throughout this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of surplus cattle, the Government has persisted with a negative program of giving preference to frozen semen without attempting to send any more than 400 of our more productive dairy animals to India, which in no way has matched the effort of our small Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It caused almost single-handedly the economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of the last 3 to 4 years, because the problems with oil and petrol flowed over into the whole problem of the motor vehicle- our inability to use the existing high consumption vehicles, the need for vehicles  in toto  the decline in the use of oil and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, developing countries in the world have never faced a greater <span class="highlight">crisis</span> than they are facing at present, not merely because of the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, not merely because of oil prices, not merely because of oil inflated prices, but also because of the difficulties that many countries have with nitrogenous fertilisers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surprisingly there is not as much financial wealth as was predicted four or five years ago when the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> arose late in 1973 as a result of the quadrupling of crude oil prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We saw as a result of the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in late 1 973 just what disruption such price increases as occurred then and subsequently and the rapidity of such increases can be caused to the economies of major Western countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many respects the Western world countries almost without exception are living through a period of considerable financial and economic difficulty with lower than optimum growth rates, higher than normal long term unemployment and the like and I think that much of that difficulty can be slated home to the dramatic effects on them of the Middle East oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of 1973 and subsequently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>And for the first time since the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of October 1973, Australia’s economic problems and their solution depend more on what happens here than on what happens overseas, among our great trading partners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770823_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>While Australia has been insulated from the effects of the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> by a plentiful supply of energy resources, the dwindling supply of petroleum has meant that many countries must change over to other sources of energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What this debate does is focus on some aspects of the world energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> although the matter has not been presented in that way today by Government spokesmen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I feel that, given the enormity of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, the complexities of the ingredients of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and the daunting challenges which the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> presents for the future, we should have had a debate on oil last week, on natural gas last night and a debate on uranium today with the promise of a debate on energy policy later, probably slightly after the arrival of Godot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government had prepared and presented an overall policy first into which this commitment to uranium mining and export was slotted I am sure that the community would have been better served and more wisely informed, not only on what the Government was intending but also on how what was being proposed fitted into the international energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> scene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As is outlined in the speech delivered by the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  today nuclear energy is the only viable alternative that most countries have available to meet their essential needs of electrical energy in the wake of the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was, we were told, absolutely no reason for Australia to be affected by the economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that had affected every Western economy as a result of the October 1973 Middle East war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the goal of limiting proliferation of nuclear weapons while at the same time easing the world’s energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is best accomplished by Australia agreeing to provide uranium for peaceful purposes and under the most stringent conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Since 1973 when the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> struck as a deadly blow the industrial heartland of Western Europe in particular, as well as that of North America, the Western world has been faced by the immediate need to seek and to find and develop alternative sources of energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is part of a global debate which is taking place against the background of an impending world energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of unprecedented and potentially disastrous dimensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While Australia has been relatively insulated from the effects of the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> thus far, we must not formulate policies which ignore the world energy problem and the difficulties which face energy deficient countries, many of which are major trading partners of ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The communists need a <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of energy in the world, and if they succeed in this campaign they will succeed in creating that <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we would have no permanent solution to the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>; all we would have would be a permanent poisoning of the whole of the earth’s surface and a permanent risk to future generations yet unborn, for thousands of yearshundreds of thousands of years- to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The most developed nation in the world today, the United States of America, earlier this year as a result of a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in its energy production and supply could not prevent the deaths of many of its citizens in the coldest snap experienced in that nation in recent times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is becoming increasingly clear to the people of this country that the poor state of the economy, which was accepted to be the case in December 1975, at the time of the election, was due not to policies of the Labor Government but to the world economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which had overtaken all the developed and under-developed nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What the Opposition is saying m the amendment has already been proved in the past 12 months, namely, that inflation has not been controlled, that unemployment has soared and that there is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not believe that there is a member of this Parliament who would suggest that the world is not facing an energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Opposition really suggesting that we can sufficiently retreat to a less energy reliant state of existence in the time available before the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> becomes crucial? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is a fairly emotional example but surely that is what a real energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly the international economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which has overtaken the world and the increased technical problems associated with nuclear reactors have reduced the present demand for nuclear generated electric power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Instead, I believe that this House should be debating a motion seeking to congratulate the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden)  for his action to expose the policies of this Government not only prior to the November 1976 devaluation but also in respect of the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771004_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that by this time next year the States will recognise that if they do not come to the party and really co-operate with the capital costs of nongovernment schools we will reach the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which the honourable member for Lilley predicted and within the next few years we will not have the availability of educational facilities in the nongovernment school sector which this country, in my opinion, should be committed to retain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is part of a global debate which is taking place against the background of an impending world energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of quite unprecedented and potentially disastrous dimensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">crisis</span> does not lie in some indefinite future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do honourable members opposite believe that at a time of energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, which is forthcoming, they could be an influence in the international scene by abdicating from the arena? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the few moments I have, I want to deal with the so-called energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and the safeguards proposals, and I want to say a few words about Australian Labor Party policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me quickly look at the question of the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that is not true because the so-called ‘energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>’ is due to a potential shortage of liquid propellant fuel for transport services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The ANZ Bank index shows a severe recession in 1961- the result of the Menzies credit squeeze- a shallower trough in 1966-67, a sharp deterioration in 1971 ending in about April 1972, a splendid expansionary phase throughout 1973, a decline during the world-wide recession following the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of 1974, and the beginning of recovery in late 1975 and early 1976 when the effects of the Hayden Budget were still working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Excessive wage demands had caused Australia’s unemployment and inflation <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You cannot blame the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> for inflation in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until the ‘oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span>’ of 1973-74 it was widely assumed that growing world demand could and would be satisfied from established sources of supply without major upheavals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771107_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of countries have, under the impact of the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, adopted objectives of energy ‘self-reliance’, ‘energy independence’, or ‘greater self-sufficiency’ in energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771107_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no field where such new policies and intitiatives are more urgent than this industry which finds itself in a deepening <span class="highlight">crisis</span> as a result of the Fraser Government’s policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771107_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is why there is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in education at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771107_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Secondly, Australia along with other countries shortly is going to face a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in liquid fuel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There were not sufficient fire engines to deal with a Jumbo crash or anything above a Fokker crash during the major part of this <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An admitted official figure of 445,000 unemployed can be seen only as a national <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only that part of the unemployment <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that refuses to be submerged by the Government’s crude campaign of bluster and moral blackmail against so called ‘dole bludgers’ and its continual fiddling of the figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I have pointed out, this is only part of the story, part of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of unemployment in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The unemployment <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is more than just a matter of depressing statistics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We must recognise that there has been in our society over recent years a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of confidence in our political system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope the Government will approach those three years with that principle pre-eminently in mind because throughout the world democratic party systems are going through a time of very great <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We were in office- never in power, only in office- at a time when an international economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> overtook the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are people in our society for whom life must seem a never ending struggle from <span class="highlight">crisis</span> point to <span class="highlight">crisis</span> point and from problem to problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australian manufacturing industry is in acute financial <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In part manufacturing’s problems are manifestations of the world economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in which all countries including Australia are enmeshed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That malaise has sharpened the impact on industry of the current economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Less than a week ago in this House the present Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  took the view that there is really no economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be a conference and a debate in this House on the possible <span class="highlight">crisis</span> looming in the coal industry and also in the steel industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and shortage throughout the world does not come home fully to the people of Australia at any time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not yet realised the severe implications of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which faces Europe, North America and other areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because we are so fortunate with huge reserves of coal and other fuels, and now of course with uranium, it does not mean that we can turn our backs on the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation was brought about principally in an era when even those two countries did not really realise fully the significance of the shortage of oil and the impending <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Impassable roads are no answer to a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> or an emergency when they are the only roads in existence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will return to that matter in more detail, but remaining on the general level that statement, combined with the continued refusal of this Government to revitalise the economy through the public sector, its continued determination to clamp down on any movement aimed at improving life styles in this country, its insistence that the workers and wage earners of Australia must pay the cost of our economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, the sheer pall over any growth, the sheer lack of any excitement or any feeling of national pride or development generated by this Speech, indicate a general feeling of inertia and boredom in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is in an economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we look at the inconsistency of the Government’s policies, we see that Australia is in an economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He made that statement in the context of the Chamberlain doctrine of appeasement, which had already brought about the resignation of Anthony Eden, and in the light of the Czechoslovakian <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of 1938. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is by pretending that that can be done, because it may be politically popular, that the Budgets, of many other countries in the Western world and not only of this country are led into a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compare what is needed with the last Lynch Budget forecast of 2 per cent real growth for 1977-78, and with the later and rather optimistic OECD forecast for calendar year 1978 of  VA  per cent, and one can better understand the magnitude of the unemployment <span class="highlight">crisis</span> confronting this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What is the response of the Prime Minister to this <span class="highlight">crisis</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We face a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> situation within 10 years so far as liquid fuel supply is concerned, yet the Government offers only a tentative and partial energy conservation program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be embarrassing to the Minister for National Resources,  Mr Anthony,  and  Senator Webster,  that many of the States have financial commitments to solar energy which indicate a far more visionary understanding of the impending global energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> than has been displayed by the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We all might suffer from an energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> sometimes when we have to get out of bed and go to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There were 7,300 fewer houses built when the need for more reached <span class="highlight">crisis</span> proportions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Speech was depressing and, stripped of its euphemistic grandness and its attempts to describe grandly the most unimaginative legislative and administrative program, it means the perpetration of an economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and the Government’s determination that wage and salary earners- millions of Australians- will pay the price of recovery, if the economy is to recover in the foreseeable future from the deep trough in which this Government has put it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Gill figures reveal the situation only with regard to males but in the past few weeks a project conducted by four Melbourne students under the control of a professional social worker entitled ‘A Study of Homeless Women in Melbourne’ has unveiled a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in Melbourne that the nature of the homeless women problem generally has hidden from society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report underlines the fundamental contradiction which is built into the nation’s transport program when it refers to the near certainty of Australia’s reversal to overwhelming dependency on imported oil in the 1 980s at a time of a mounting world wide petroleum <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, while the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> makes the need for a fresh approach to land based transport in Australia compelling, especially with respect to Australian cities, there are other factors involved as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion let me say with all the sincerity that I have that this nation is rapidly reaching a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> state in terms of its hydrocarbons, and particularly oil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is scandalous that this Government, in the face of a well-recognised energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, is doing nothing to persuade the people that there ought to be a rational national energy policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our aim is to inject into the Parliament through this committee a greater understanding of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report of the Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Poverty showed that the majority of these unemployed people had little or no buffer against any potential financial <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is not the only country facing this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> but it seems to be the only one intent on doing nothing about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I feel that when we are talking about an energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and looking to the future we should remember that wood is a renewable source. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Perhaps we are just paying lip service to the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and are not taking the proper and appropriate action that we should be taking at this point of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the wake of the world energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> many countries have no viable alternative energy source other than nuclear power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no ‘<span class="highlight">crisis</span> ‘ in health care spending in the sense that the situation is out of control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They certainly did receive exorbitant rises and their salaries moved to a level which in many respects is fundamental to the current health <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a government deep in <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: In view of the substantial cutbacks which are occurring in our mineral export contracts, and the resulting further reduction that will occur in our level of exports, and noting the substantial outflow of invisible earnings, with detrimental effect on the balance on current account, can the Treasurer assure the business sector of the economy that he will not pursue an intensification of the prevailing budget  strategy which will lead to an even greater balance-of-payments <span class="highlight">crisis</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that we are facing a fuel <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is no <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in solid fuels, in energy driving fuels; the shortage exists in liquid fuels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think also that the Government should realise that amending legislation to gain a short term relief in our balance of payments <span class="highlight">crisis</span> or for any of the other purposes which have been brought forward during the debate, such as to promote the accelerated processing, mining and export of uranium, should not take precedence over justice to our oppressed indigenous people, which is the theme which the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs very rightly has stressed from the outset of his accepting the Aboriginal Affairs Ministry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here in Australia- indeed, in this very city- we have a far more sensible proposition to beat the power <span class="highlight">crisis</span>; a far more permanent and complete solution to our balance of payments problems; and a far better remedy for the parlous state of our motor industry in particular and, indeed, of the world’s power generation <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is a power <span class="highlight">crisis</span> we need to develop this alternative which is, I repeat, more promising than nuclear power because it is cleaner, cheaper and much better proved than the technology to cope with nuclear power waste disposal and security for which we are still waiting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government cannot expect that the Atomic Energy Act of a former generation- when atomic potential was seen outstandingly as a feature of the Cold War- should be equally relevant to the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is leading us there ever faster in the name of deferring those crises- the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, the national economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and the national balance of payments <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Obviously the Parliament will receive a full annual report from the Supervising Scientist, but I imagine that there will be communications between the Supervising Scientist and the Minister on a weekly or monthly basis whenever a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> occurs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The gains at the upper end of the property scale will be great and an opportunity will be lost to collect, over the next few years, what will amount to hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue, while the Government presses down on those people in the community who have no asset backing, no security and who for that reason live in fear of sickness and potential unemployment or any kind of major <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>New South Wales is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> State, under a Premier who is now busily engaged in trying to divert attention from the consequences of determined and deliberate policy decisions which have brought about this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and which have created a situation in which a $lm a day dispute by employees of the Government can so seriously damage a region and so seriously damage the economy of the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia ‘s policy is based squarely on our recognition of Australia’s obligations as a country well endowed with energy resources to make those resources available to other countries, many of which have no real alternative, in the wake of the world energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, than to turn to nuclear energy as a means of supplying electricity to their peoples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is amusing under these circumstances- or frightening I suppose- that the Prime Minister takes this opportunity to remove himself from the scene, to go overseas in an attempt to bring the rest of the world back from what he sees as the brink of economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Joint Statement issued by the Australian Minister for Defence  (Mr Barnard)  and the US Secretary of Defence  (Mr Schlesinger)  on 10 January 1974 stated ‘The Ministers recalled the provisions of Article III of the ANZUS Treaty and confirmed the importance to both Governments of urgent consultations in case of a developing international <span class="highlight">crisis</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-34-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those honourable members who listened to the electronic media last weekend must have been utterly bored with the hysteria of the Leader of the Opposition in saying that there was a major political <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, that the Prime Minister’s integrity was under challenge, that the Prime Minister had been misleading the Parliament, that this week he was going to bring down the Prime Minister and that the Government was at risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me give the House an illustration from the remarks of the honourable member for Port Adelaide of the way in which the Opposition, even tonight, is failing to face the real issues in this situation of <span class="highlight">crisis</span> facing telecommunications in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clearly, Telecom’s total acceptance of Commissioner Clarkson ‘s proposal, which was supported by the Government after discussion with Telecom, indicates its preparedness to have the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in telecommunications in Australia resolved promptly and properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have been left behind in world markets and we have no hope of solving the problems of the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> unless this Government gives motivation and incentive to the people who are able to do the work and not hand-outs to the people who have shares in BHP. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may not be obvious because we do not have at this moment blackouts and petrol rationing, but the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is very real. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me just quickly run through some of the other aspects of the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, areas which will require government initiatives and action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At this stage we should pay tribute to the Victorian Government and the Premier,  Mr Hamer,  who, in appreciation of the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, has personally arranged vast experimental work in conjunction with overseas experts to convert Victoria’s huge brown coal reserves to liquid fuels in order to tide us over this <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In conclusion I remind honourable members that we have an energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has appreciated the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and in the Budget has moved to overcome it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has continued to offer a few training schemes, primarily aimed at the youth, as its contribution to the major <span class="highlight">crisis</span> facing our people and our economic and social structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For these reasons this Government stands condemned on the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> it has created within the Australian housing industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simplistic view that increasing exports is the answer is also wrong, because it has been the very success of Japan’s export effort, its enormous positive trade balance in relation to most of its trading partners, which has resulted in most economic pundits now putting the blame on Japan as one of the causes of the present world economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to refer to the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, the problem of the Aboriginal settlement at Mornington Island and, finally, the urgent need for a national youth community cadet scheme to assist in the evergrowing problem of youth employment which simply will not go away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my electorate we have what could become a <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government, faced with the <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, has decided to opt out of the situation altogether. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But these are <span class="highlight">crisis</span> times which require more than just those schemes which I have outlined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, in the number of dwellings getting under way, we still see a long-term problem and <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the housing sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People interested in this area will be able to examine the report and I hope criticise the Government generally for not having taken action to overcome the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both of these factors add to the balance of payments <span class="highlight">crisis</span>- that the Government had to borrow a massive $ 1,800m to $ 1,900m from abroad last year to prop up the dollar and to avoid a further devaluation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have seen in this Budget more than any other probably this Government relying more and more on some sort of faith in the free market process to bring the economy out of the present incredible <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me state again that this funding increase is a token response to a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in Aboriginal housing that has been created by this Government’s own deliberate and massive cutbacks in housing funds since it has been in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Back in 1975 in what was a fairly heated campaign, if one might say so, in what was a campaign in which the Labor Party sought to generate a phoney constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, the people of Australia were looking to real value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Government fumbles with ihe economic policy, willi the automation <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and with job pressure from imports, it still wants to give the impression that the unemployed are to blame. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The sooner this Parliament says as a parliament that there is no simple remedy, that there is a deep and profound economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> right throughout the Western world which is affecting Australia, and that when it occurred the Whitlam Government was in office and its great tragedy and its great mistake was that it did not perceive either the nature or the dimension of what was occurring in Western society and continued to try to implement its program unconscious of the fact or unable to comprehend that the great boom in Western industrialised society was over the better it will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sooner honourable members on both sides of the chamber abandon the approach of saying that a Labor government did something in 1972 so it is all right for a government to do the same in 1978 the better it will be because there is a deep, significant economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in Australia here and now, and we are not alone in that respect, and the first thing we have to say to ourselves is that there are no simple answers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the points with which I would like to deal is the proposition that somehow we are in a state of <span class="highlight">crisis</span> as far as health costs are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>People tend to respond to what they perceive as crises by jumping up and down and doing things, being seen to be doing things because there is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Health costs are not in a state of <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, I emphasise again, in the medical sense of the word. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is reacting as if we are in a state of extreme <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The alternative Budget introduced by the Labor leader would therefore involve a balance of payments <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, a severe cut in corporate investment and profitability, a 180-degree turn in monetary policy and a significantly faster wage growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the earlier debate on the Budget I talked about the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> we have now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1) 1978-79 which show that this Government has appreciated the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and is doing something about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I come now to the most vital aspect of the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>- capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly, the effects of rapid inflation, rapid increases in wages, decreases in profit margins and the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> have meant that industry has had to become more efficient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The wise, the wealthy and the powerful are now deserting the suburbs and moving back into the intermediate areas of the large cities because they can see the coming impact of the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and its implications for urban transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The outer suburbs are facing a monumental transport <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which will not be easily solved because of the land use patterns that have been established and the preference for single dwelling units. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second reason is that secondary industry in Australia receives excessive protection through tariffs, quotas and at times of <span class="highlight">crisis</span> quite substantial cash contributions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1976 and most of 1977 1 suppose one could say that things went along without <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in spite of the influx of children from South America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition to that, at the National Conference of the Australian Council of Salaried and Professional Associations yesterday Professor Bill Ford said that the real <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of technological change will hit Australia in 1 980-8 1 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The real <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of technological change will certainly hit us in 1980-81. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said this morning, the employment and unemployment situation has reached a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>More money will have to be put into job creation programs as quickly as possible if we are to avoid the sort of social <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that is now upon us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-In the course of this Committee debate thus far, the very serious and important points made by the honourable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr Young)  about the extent of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that exists in Australian society in terms of the unemployment level and the failure of this Government to meet this problem have gone unanswered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whenever honourable gentlemen opposite talk about the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the economic system all the burden, responsibility and blame is always put on the lower 50 per cent of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no establishment in Brisbane providing specifically and solely for <span class="highlight">crisis</span> accommodation (i.e. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Primmer Lodge, a self-supporting longerterm care community for children aged 14-17, has recently received State Government funding to operate 6 short-term <span class="highlight">crisis</span> accommodation beds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has not yet started operating its 6 <span class="highlight">crisis</span> accommodation beds, and at present has 1 1 ‘longer-term’ (i.e. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only are those residents (the majority) referred by Children’s Services receiving regular payments (‘MLI payments’) under the existing subsidy scheme, but the Lodge received a $4,000 grant  in advance  for operating the 6 <span class="highlight">crisis</span> beds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such organisation shows the potential for funding once a centre is approved (for <span class="highlight">crisis</span> accommodation) by the State government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Lodge aims to provide sensitive, caring accommodation for its ‘<span class="highlight">crisis</span>’ residents, but under no conditions will they stay for more than four working days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Impressions of its operation once the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> beds are operating will be most useful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They all have one thing in common: the opinion that the Brisbane youth <span class="highlight">crisis</span> accommodation situation is far from satisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The usual procedure followed by referring bodies looking for <span class="highlight">crisis</span> accommodation is rather ad hoc, and involves one of the following alternatives: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the area of <span class="highlight">crisis</span> accommodation, its advance payments to Primmer Lodge are a new initiative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department is aware of the need for <span class="highlight">crisis</span> accommodation, as it is the first point of contact for homeless children picked up by police (often in city parks). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In a recent study of 62 such children, 24 were placed in <span class="highlight">crisis</span> accommodation of some description, 18 were placed in hostels (eg. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Crisis</span> accommodation (for 2-7 days, say) would only fill part of the need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a tremendous demand in Brisbane for youth accommodation (both <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and long-term supportive). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whenever I mentioned ‘<span class="highlight">crisis</span> accommodation’ and explained that it usually meant for less than a week, the typical comment was ‘What then?’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The feeling was that <span class="highlight">crisis</span> accommodation alone won ‘t serve a worthwhile purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of liquidity had its origins in the 1973 Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries oU <span class="highlight">crisis</span>; one consequence being the sudden and complete closure of the Japanese market to Australian export beef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781115_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make the point that it is indeed unfortunate that in the ensuing four years research into beef marketing has centred on the quantification and dimensions of the cattle industry <span class="highlight">crisis</span> rather than on providing a direction out of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, both at the economic level and the political level, to ensure an improvement in the marketing structure of the Australian beef industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781115_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Bearing in mind that impartiality between the communities in Lebanon is very important, but that humane and timely aid to the people is even more important, will the Australian Government encourage and even support nonGovernment welfare organisations to dispatch medical teams to Lebanon, to work in any areas where they are needed and welcomed, as recommended in the report entitled ‘The Lebanon <span class="highlight">Crisis</span>- Humanitarian Aspects’ tabled in December 1976 by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781115_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-49-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Last Friday, the State Housing Ministers met with the Federal Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development,  (Mr Groom)  in Adelaide to try to overcome the serious <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that has developed in the housing industry in Australia and, in particular, to discuss the seriousness of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the public housing sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781121_reps_31_hor112/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government is caught in a very serious predicament; it is in a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> situation in the housing industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781121_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a matter of fact, the dispute which caused last week’s petrol <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in Victoria ended in the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission when Commissioner H. Neil ruled that members of the Transport Workers Union would make deliveries from the Esso Spotswood plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781121_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Ten days ago, 1 1 November, was the third anniversary of what we would all agree was the most traumatic and divisive constitutional <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in this nation’s history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781121_reps_31_hor112/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of the three major protagonists in that <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, one has fled into a comfortable exile in the English home counties, a most appropriate resting place for one of his social pretensions; the second has retired from politics to a great Australian institution, a most appropriate home for an Australian of his intellect and breadth of vision; the third, the one most responsible for the perversion of our parliamentary customs and traditions, remains as Prime Minister, a continuing symbol of the bitterness and division unleashed by the events of November 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781121_reps_31_hor112/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, he is facing, as is his party, an identity <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is suffering from a serious identity <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and the Leader of the Opposition is totally incapable of handling the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last week he told a parliamentary group of which I was a member that there is no world energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>; that the world has extensive natural gas reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Perhaps someone should tell the Minister that there is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in our apprenticeship system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Public discussion on unemployment has frequently degenerated into harangues of so-called bludgers, in place of rational consideration of the causes, nature and effect of the employment <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, the powerless victims of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> have somehow come to stand accused of having created their own unemployment- a twist of logic which represents a classic example of blaming the victim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My solution goes to the reality and truth of what we are doing, basically the problem is that we are facing a <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He then said that in his view a temporary purpose was to avert the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and the disaster that the Labor Attorney-General of the day thought on indications at that time would have arrived by <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When  Mr Jackson  looked at manufacturing industry and saw the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that occurred in it, he did not single out wages as being the basis of the whole <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a gamble indeed, for if such sales are not up to expectations, within five or six years Australia may face a double <span class="highlight">crisis</span>- an energy shortage for transport and a severe balance of payments problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply say that constitutionally it is not a Commonwealth responsibility and therefore the commitment both by the previous Government to provide $190m from 1973 to 1978, and by the present Government to increase that commitment by over 50 per cent to $300m for the five-year period, is a very significant indication by the Commonwealth Government and Commonwealth governments of both political colours, of the importance of ensuring that Australia has a proper urban public transport system as we move out of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first century with all the problems which we know are around the corner, not the least of which is the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless something is done within 10 years metropolitan Hobart will have a transport <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ferry companies such as Sullivans Cove Ferry Co. Pty Ltd and Roche Bros, in conjunction with the Transport Commission which acquired in very strange circumstances ferries from several places, one or two of which were not exactly a success, provided a ferry service across the Derwent at that dme of <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is to develop the way that many people believe it is likely to develop through into the 1980s, then certainly we will need national energy policies, which we do not have at the moment, we will need a national energy plan and I believe we will need a national transport plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our society cannot afford to have at least three-quarters of a million people not producing and face a fiscal <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government is confronted with just such a <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is shameful that when unemployment is a major national <span class="highlight">crisis</span> a profitable public enterprise should be restrained from reaching its employment potential, simply so that international profiteers can operate with the Government’s blessing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By being locked into import parity we will suffer as the Iranian <span class="highlight">crisis</span> pushes up the oil price set by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But today we are faced with an international <span class="highlight">crisis</span> on a par with the Cuban <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of 1962. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The gravity of this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> demands our attention now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is necessary for me to say now, before going into detail, that the Australian Government’s recent statements and actions concerning the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in Indo-China have been mere echoes of the statements made by the United States Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The companies in Australia which can grow big enough at the expense of the smaller firms to specialise their production for export in tandem with the same big companies operating in other countries in our regional production Une are, in a way, responsible for our present economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He referred to the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, beef prices and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have the most <span class="highlight">crisis</span>-ridden and scandalprone government in the history of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All were involved in one way or another in some sort of government <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that no government has been more <span class="highlight">crisis</span>-ridden and more scandal-ridden than the present one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet within three days the Minister was able to put behind him this <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of conscience and, condoned by the Prime Minister, expect the Australian people to pretend, without any explanation, that it never happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They cannot be divorced from the general strategic and political environment and, to the extent that that environment deteriorates, their credibility as instruments of <span class="highlight">crisis</span> management is diminished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to that document to establish that the Government’s early recognition of the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span> was firmly based on a long-standing anaylSls of the strategic situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In responding to this unfolding <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, the Government quickly and accurately assessed the course the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> was likely to follow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to the latter ‘s credit that in the current phase of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> it has so far shown such restraint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are under no illusions that we can play the pivotal role in resolving this <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The cessation of oil exports from Iran, previously the world’s second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia, has brought into focus again- as if the 1973 oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> was not sufficientthe world’s heavy dependence on imported oil, most of which originates from the Middle East region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At a time when the world faces another Middle East <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, when supplies of export oil to many countries are in jeopardy, when many countries, some of them close neighbours, are now faced with not only trying to find alternative supplies of oil and associated products but also having to pay enormous prices when they happen to find a market in which they can buy, the importance of selfsufficiency is emphasised once again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What impeccable timing the Opposition has, coming into this chamber at a time when the world faces an oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> to complain about oil prices for short term political effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was the Labor Government which, by burying its head in the sand in 1973, 1974 and 1975 and pretending that there was no oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, pretending that there never would be an oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and pretending that it would get away with cheating on the companies looking for oil, with the result that oil exploration stopped in this nation- through a combination of those factors- caused the severe trauma which all of a sudden was involved in Australia catching up with the real world situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The company then telexed the Minister, repeating all these terms such as ‘play down’ and ‘undertakings’ which he had concocted with them, and requiring of him that, as the official Minister of the Government, he intercede either directly or indirectly through another department, with the PJT to apprise it as Caltex requested- the word is ‘apprise’- of the issues surrounding the real supply <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and how the companies were entitled to fix the precedent of recovery of premiums above the OPEC price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790327_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, we wish to ensure that the immediate situation which we face because of the Middle East <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is dealt with adequately and properly so that we may preserve for the Australian people proper supplies of very important fuel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790327_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is because during this Government’s period of office we have had more idle resources in this country than at any other time in the country’s history, that we have had the deficit problems that are forcing Australia this year into what can be described only as a mounting fiscal <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He would not know what the words ‘fiscal’ and ‘responsible ‘ mean but he probably would know what ‘<span class="highlight">crisis</span>’ means because he belongs to the group of people who brought this country into a great <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the three years that people regret so much throughout our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no doubt that not only, as we have pointed out in this Parliament previously, are the unskilled and semi-skilled people bound up in the enormous <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and problem of unemployment, but also we have the professional people involved in it here as well as in many other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of 1973 precipitated the fundamental recognition that the world was facing an energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While Australia has been insulated from the effects of the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> by a plentiful supply of energy resources, the dwindling supply of petroleum has meant that many countries must change over to other sources of energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the present world energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and with Australia’s huge deposits of coal, whereby we can generate our own electricity and provide our own means of motivation for rail transport we should be getting on with the job instead of allocating such paltry amounts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This <span class="highlight">crisis</span> has highlighted the folly of past decisions and indecision as a result of which our railway systems, and for that matter our coastal shipping services, have been allowed to degenerate to a level where their role bears little resemblance to the proud role they played in establishing this country in its formative years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government was dressing up the figure because it knew that there would be a great <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in interest rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But as great as that obligation is, it will not distract us from the equally important task of revealing the depth of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which this country faces and the extent of the damage which this Government has done to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The policy recognises Australia’s obligation as a country well endowed with energy resources to make those resources available to other countries, many of which have no alternative in the wake of the world energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> but to turn to nuclear energy as a means of supplying electricity to their peoples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a nation obtaining more sophisticated defence equipment, we have to ask ourselves whether our local manufacturing industries are geared, equipped and able to participate in the continuing manufacture of some of the components involved and, more importantly, whether they are able and have the resources to keep that equipment functional and in service in a <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, this chaos, this law of the jungle, this exploitation of the many by the few can and must be solved by planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Inner city areas were either suffering from urban blight and decay or they were experiencing the early stage of gentrification where the potential capital gains of recycling older established houses were becoming increasingly obvious to the speculators and where above all Australia was facing a future without an effective public transport system at a time in which the oil price <span class="highlight">crisis</span> was appearing as a signal that the time of the automobile as the principal form of urban transport was coming to at least the beginning of the end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the 1 980s, with the coming energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and energy price <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, increasingly the kind of pattern in Australian cities will be seen to be catastrophic in terms of servicing costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As helpful as lectures may be- honourable members have been receiving several lectures during adjournment debates- to uninitiated economists, they do not assist this House to come to grips with the basic issues that face Western nations during a current world wide economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This excludes the rest of the world, which can be classified, as the Government would see it, as ossifying under tyrannical socialist rule or as part of the Third World, which the Government tends to expect to be in a situation of perpetual <span class="highlight">crisis</span> anyway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe it can be argued that we in the West faced a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of overproduction, followed by a long period of booming investment in which it seemed that there was only one way to go- to grow bigger and better, to form larger and larger combines and to transcend any boundary, whether it be local, State, national or international, in search of larger and larger markets and, more importantly, larger and larger profits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of 1973 followed the recognition by the Middle Eastern powers that they could not go on subsidising a Western and Japanese economic miracle forever, given the fact that for many of these countries oil was their only major asset and bargaining tool. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even at this late stage there is still time for the Government to ensure that Australia need not fear the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which threatens to become a common occurrence for the remainder of this century, but it will have to do a lot better than produce a document that might as well have been written by oil companies in board rooms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>First of all he knifed his leader in the back, then he thrust himself into the leadership of the Liberal Party and then he went out to the country and said: ‘The problems of 1973 and 1974 were not problems related to a world international economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span>’- as the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  on the front bench knows. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-On 1 7 August last year I made a speech in this place about an impending energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and its effect on the isolated areas of Australia, particularly areas which have no sources of energy other than oil based energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not want to sound like a prophet of doom, as in the book entitled  Future Shock  but a small part of the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is here now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Traditionally, 60 per cent of Australia’s supplies of aviation gasoline have come from Abadan in Iran, a refinery which almost went out of production during the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in Iran. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because there is a world shortage of aviation gasoline, we are in a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a small <span class="highlight">crisis</span> on the national scene but it is a major <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the isolated areas of Australia which have no alternative means of transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having listened to the rhetoric from certain Opposition spokesmen since 24 May it appears that they do not understand the great difficulties now facing the world because of the current energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the legislation introduced by the Minister for National Development  (Mr Newman)  and the way he has approached the problems of the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of 1979, on behalf of the Government team under the leadership of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  is what is needed now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have faced the difficult situation presented by the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> by looking at the amount of oil that we are currently producing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it was precisely because a previous Administration took no account of the economic consequences of its decisions that Australia got into such very great difficulties when oil search was stopped dead at the very time when there was a major oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in the world, when mineral development and exploration were stopped dead, and when manufacturers in Australia lost their domestic and overseas markets as a result of most rampant inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fact is that for all Government members’ claims to be sound, solid and reliable managers, on the whole they are a pack of slick charlatans lurching from one <span class="highlight">crisis</span> to another, and the health measures have tended to be the victims of those crises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The energy policies on which all countries are working- Australia’s energy policy was enunciated on 27 June this year- were brought to a head by the price increases of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in Iran at the beginning of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790821_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>House, is that the then Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations,  Mr Street,  in making a statement to the House in September of last year, for the first time gave the people of Australia some idea of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of unemployment with which we were living and some idea of the great difficulties of unemployment with which we were going to be confronted in the next five to 10 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790821_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those of us who follow world events realise that the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which is facing the world and which has necessitated increasing the cost of petroleum products in Australia is putting a considerable burden on the people of Canberra who rely on petroleum products for heat at this time of the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the Prime Minister and because of his wanting to get some value out of a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in industrial relations, the proper aim of this Government on real industrial relations is swept under the carpet and is replaced by this confrontation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was not so difficult to accomplish them in Australia until that time, but in 1973 this country and the rest of the world had experienced the external effects of the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I merely say that in response to any <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, whether it be the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of the 1973 period or the one which is presently upon the Western world, honourable members should ask themselves whether Australia is going to go for the short term solution or the long term solution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wanted to refer particularly to the latest <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in what seems to be a series of crises that afflict these various programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> will be with us very much in the next few weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Portuguese, the Church constituted a kind of buffer between the colonial administration and the ordinary people, to whom it offered some sanctuary in times of <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of a sudden, there is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> where the entire population of a country may be wiped out because the great national and international governments and agencies were more concerned about diplomacies than the sanctity of human life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have now reached a situation where, like it or not, Australia cannot get away from the various world influences in the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, that <span class="highlight">crisis</span> has taken on deep implications for Australians and particularly for Australian motorists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frankly, I do not believe it is overstating the position to say it is moving to <span class="highlight">crisis</span> proportions because it could well prove, after tomorrow, that objections come from not just one presidential member of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, together with all the commissioners, but also other presidential members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The front page of the  Diamond Valley News  of last Tuesday, 9 October reveals that yet another <span class="highlight">crisis</span> is afflicting the Eltham Shire Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The voluntary agencies, already in a state of <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, will have to find money and food vouchers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Families at risk in this country need economic and social justice to prevent <span class="highlight">crisis</span> situations which so often occur unnecessarily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the lack of adequate controls and protection for the investor has led to a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of confidence where Australians would rather save than invest in Australian enterprises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and the continuation of the increase in the price of fuel, will the Minister undertake, immediately and urgently, a study to determine the effects of emission controls over the last few years, not just the stage proposed for next year, and report to the Parliament and to the nation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The resolution of the political <span class="highlight">crisis</span> involving National Assembly members is somewhat unclear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other countries, such as Japan, in the face of a world energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> are closing down their refineries and smelters at a very great rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have provided detailed statistics on the growing housing <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in Australia, especially for low and lower-middle income earners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a real <span class="highlight">crisis</span> situation, and we have to make housing available for those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In support of my remarks on health let me refer to the fact that some weeks ago a number of doctors in Queensland sent a petition to the Director-General in Queensland stating that there is a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in this region; that there is an urgent need to improve the situation by taking health care away from the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Islander Advancement and giving it to some more appropriate department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even before the avgas <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, the general aviation industry was beginning to suffer the effects of the Government’s oil import parity pricing policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would indicate that it is somewhat late on the scene but acknowledge that it usually takes some form of <span class="highlight">crisis</span> or some threat of long-term and continual political damage to political parties in order to have action of this nature taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Time and time again the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> was raised with us and time and time again those who raised this matter with us stressed the need for Europe to proceed with its nuclear development program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any alleged <span class="highlight">crisis</span> in health care and health costs is being caused by the cry wolf stance being taken by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another aspect that I might mention is the report’s comments on <span class="highlight">crisis</span> management, another area with a major Federal-State component. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report’s comments on <span class="highlight">crisis</span> management are consistent with and in effect endorse the contingency planning arrangements and other proposals that are being or have been developed in association between the relevant Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that we could ever be fierce enough in the defence of our freedoms and of the standards which we require to ensure that the systems of authority within our community are answerable; even at times of <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, they can be made accountable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that the energy price <span class="highlight">crisis</span> has re-opened a series of previously unquestioned assumptions about the most efficient forms of transport to undertake different transport tasks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a time when it is critical to have effective transport systems, each of the major systems, it might be argued, faces some sort of <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that the rail industry in this country, taken as a whole, is in a state of very serious <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This <span class="highlight">crisis</span> cannot be separated from the more general economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which we, as a nation, face. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The railways are part of what might be described as a more general public sector <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the 1978 international monetary <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, world finance problems and instability gave rise to a major explosion in international shipping rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extent of the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that faces their industry is reflected in their willingness to take direct action, as will be seen by the trucks parked at the front of Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise that point because it is being recognised increasingly that the contraction of rail systems over extremely long periods- the contraction has accelerated in recent years- in terms of the mounting energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> whereby the shift will be more and more from the use of liquid fuels to the use of coal, will increasingly become critical in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The two cities with the worst <span class="highlight">crisis</span>, of course, are Sydney and Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Hughes will give more details about the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> situation, of housing costs in the electorate of Cook and about how this scheme is completely irrelevant to the constituents of someone like the honourable member for Cook who will be struggling to survive at the next election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government does not want to even try to control the <span class="highlight">crisis</span> that is occurring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For thousands of people the problem has now reached <span class="highlight">crisis</span> proportions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to stress over and over again that the real problem facing the single income families, earning up to  135  per cent of average weekly earnings, whether they live in Sydney or Melbourne, is that they are in a <span class="highlight">crisis</span> situation when it comes to acquiring a home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Islam’s resurgence internationally is related to the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> of 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Acting in concert, these countries caused an international economic <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot think of any greater national project that would be of more benefit during this energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> period than the development of electricity, both as an alternative to oil power and also to give greater opportunity to Austraiian industry to capitalise on this cheaper form of energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some fundamental causes for that, including slower population growth, the energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and other factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given that at the time it was delivered Australians were facing a fuel <span class="highlight">crisis</span> and petrol rationing, the speech can be seen as little more than a panicked response from the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s reliance on liquid fuels and in alleviating the gradually worsening world energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given the severe energy <span class="highlight">crisis</span> which is facing the world, Australia has an obligation not only to itself but to the world to do everything in its power to promote energy exploration and conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those capabilities that are required to provide a military response to the lesser contingencies which could arise with little or no warning; those high performance capabilities relating to a general strategic requirement as dictated by the characteristics of the environment rather than by specific contingencies and required to provide deterrence against the use of military pressures or military means by a potential enemy to achieve its objectives and which could not be acquired within the period of warning likely to be available before a major threat to Australia could develop; and a representative selection of second tier or substitute capabilities- moderate cost, moderate performance, short lead time systems, that could be acquired in relatively large numbers during a period of developing threat- to enable the development of operating techniques, procedures and doctrines in a short period of <span class="highlight">crisis</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am confident that wool will ride out the present <span class="highlight">crisis</span> with the assistance of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>You cannot blame the oil <span class="highlight">crisis</span> for the inflation in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></li>
