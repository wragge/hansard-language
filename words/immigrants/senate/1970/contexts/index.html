<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How many <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> came to Australia from Northern Ireland in each of the years 1968. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710420_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously that is in the interests both of Australia and of the prospective
            <span class="highlight">immigrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How many <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> have entered Australia from Mauritius for the years 1968 to

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does Australia have any reciprocal agreement with the United States as regards the reimbursement of fares for the deportation of illegal <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> to meet a situation which was exemplified by last week’s O’Lear case? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>From which States of the United States of America have <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> come to Australia during the past 5 years <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many prospective Greek <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> have had their applications for entry, to Australia rejected during the past 5 years due to the refusal of the Greek Government to permit their departure? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Were any prospective French <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> denied entry to Australia during the past 5 years because of previous association with the French secret army organisation (OAS). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By this hasty act, taken without consultation with the groups of Australian citizens concerned, the Australian Government has seemingly recognised the Soviet claim that the Baltic <span class="highlight">immigrants</span>, upon their arrival in Australia, were really citizens of the U.S.S.R., and as such are not entitled to assume the protection of Australian citizenship until released from the citizenship of the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many Spanish South American refugees were sponsored as <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> by the Australian Government in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What guarantee were the <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> given concerning employment and how many of them are at present unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many of the unemployed <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> are unable to speak English. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Were all these <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> in possession of completed entry forms and had all the necessary formalities been observed before they came to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-56-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>201 <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> from Chile arrived in Australia between 1 November 1975 and 31 January 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigrants</span> from United Kingdom (Question No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Is the Minister aware of a statement in the Annual Report of the Commissioner for Community Relations for 1976 that if problems relating to mental health services for <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> are to be overcome, three approaches should be taken: ( a ) encourage the migration of more bi-lingual professionals; (b) adequate professional interpreter services: and (c) every Australian professional in the mental health field should, as part of that person’s training, undertake a course to provide some appropriate background on this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Statistics regarding <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> from Rhodesia have been recorded separately only since January 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister feel that these present safeguards protect Australia against illegal <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> who may come to Australia under an assumed name and an assumed nationality? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Did a recent report in the Sydney  Daily Telegraph  state that 38 Australians were deported from New Zealand as prohibited <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> because of criminal convictions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>About 100,000 <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> per annum will have an effect not only on the numbers but also on the content of population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700605_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is apparent that in both of the cases that we have been discussing prohibited <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> are involved? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we would all support an immigration policy which provides that people with criminal records should not be admitted as <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> to our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the substantial influence that the British migrant has had on the balance of Australia’s overall immigration policy will the Minister advise the Senate at the earliest possible opportunity what measures are being taken to ascertain why there is such a large fall-off in the balance of <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> and at the same time inquire into the cause of the large figure of 27,000 people who emigrated from this country in one year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Has the Australian Government given any consideration to changing Australia’s immigration policies and laws as a result of pressure by Japanese companies with financial interests in Australia to allow Japanese <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> into this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This item covers expenditure in connection with the repatriation in approved circumstances of migrants, and the cost of deportation of prohibited <span class="highlight">immigrants</span>, including sustenance while held in custody pending shipping accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tt is not because we will not take Asian <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> but because we discriminate against them because of the colour of their skins or the country of their origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are more <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> going home who will want to return to Australia but the number of other new migrants will be reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The title includes the words ‘for <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> and certain other persons’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The term ‘<span class="highlight">immigrants</span>’ is intended to relate to persons who have been admitted to or allowed to remain in Australia indefinitely for residence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The qualification provided by the words ‘who are ordinarily resident’ in paragraph (b) of subclause 2 of clause 4 excludes from the intended meaning of the word ‘<span class="highlight">immigrants</span>’ those persons who do not have resident status in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The term ‘certain other persons’ is intended to include naturalised Australians and the Australian-born offspring of <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> who require instruction in the English language, as well as those who are <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> under the definition already described. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Non-English speaking <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> are not specified because English speaking <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> and their children as well as their non-English speaking counterparts are to be provided with courses in citizenship education which are referred to in paragraph (b) of sub-clause (I.) <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that last week - on 17th February - 1 sought to elicit information about why Australia did not have a consistent policy in regard to the various people who are not <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> but who seek permanent residence in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> are confronted with the impact of social and economic upheaval they and their children must make a rapid and complete adjustment to a new society, to new attitudes, to new values and to new resources, all of which are different to what they have previously experienced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Intending <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> live in the centre and learn English and Australian cooking, whatever that may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is such a thing as Australian cooking, it is taught to intending <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> at the immigration centre in Athens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It teaches <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> what their future will be like when they get to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What will be the breakdown, under the following heads of the 10,000 post-war <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> who are to participate in the current migration survey: (a) State domicile, (b) country of origin, (c) length of time in Australia, and (d) occupation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> hare entered Australia from Mauritius in each of the last5 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do these <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> enter Australia under the assisted passage scheme? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A total of 68,000 <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> were carried by Qantas or its agents or connections last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also has the Department in mind increasing the amount payable by <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> under the assisted passage scheme, taking into consideration the fact that this country wants <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> who are likely to be successful here and not just those who have not been successful in their home country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This attitude is understandable when we look at the Government’s behaviour because even in Australia we practise in the case of <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> a policy which is in essence the same sort of policy that the South Africans impose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has been the intake of Irish <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> each quarter since September 1970 in the categories listed in the answer received to Senate Question No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those eligible to receive benefits under the scheme are persons in receipt of unemployment, sickness and special benefits under Part VII of the Social Services Act; <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> during the first 2 months after entry to Australia, and such <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> must be the holders of entry permits not being temporary entry permits in force under the Migration Act; and low income families as defined in section 82u of the National Health Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> were processed for entry to Australia by British Authorities in (a) Poland, (b) Roumania, (c) Bulgaria, (d) Hungary, and (e) Czechoslovakia during the past five years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The numbers of <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> processed for migrant entry into Australia and granted migrant visas by the British Authorities during the past five years in the countries mentioned were: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many prospective Spanish <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> have had their applications for entry to Australia rejected during the past 5 years due to the refusal of the Spanish Government to permit their departure? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since Opposition senators from time to time have questioned the exercise of discretion by the Department of Immigration in the operation of its policy, and especially in relation to decisions which affect people who are prohibited <span class="highlight">immigrants</span>, I should like to take this opportunity to allow the Senate, as a welcome change, to hear me congratulating the Department instead of snipping at it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to quote now from the book ‘A Nation of <span class="highlight">Immigrants</span>’ written by John F. Kennedy, an illustrious United States  President. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department has rejected no applications by prospective Greek <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> for entry to Australia during the past 5 years due to the refusal of the Greek Government to permit departure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note I think that, unlike South Africa, a very large proportion of the white inhabitants of Rhodesia are not native born Rhodesians but are quite recent <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> from Britain, South Africa and Greece in particular and from some other countries as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-133">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who are the ex-officio members of the Social Science Research Council of Australia which is entrusted with the research project on <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> in Australia, and what stage has this project reached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Immigration Project in which the Council is at present involved began in late 1967 as a 5- year study aimed at assessing the contribution made by <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> to the Australian community since World War II, and studying the problems associated with this large-scale influx of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Throughout Australia, particularly outside the Australian Capital Territory, there is clear evidence that the most depressed sections of the community - the sections of the community most in need of pre-school education for their children, particularly those children of recent <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> from countries where the language is not English - are deprived of a very essential advantage in the upbringing of their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the Government says it is not going round the world, as the previous Government did, choosing <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> on the basis of skills and craft, and bringing them here so that Australia can benefit by their youth, their health and their skills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apparently not only have the Croatian <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> been terrified by what has been done but all <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> have been terrified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not saying that any of our <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> has been or will be guilty of terrorism but we should have no doubt about anyone; we should be absolutely sure that a migrant has no record of terrorism or acts of violence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have already received a formal Note from the Yugoslav Government conveying the view, which we have of course rejected, that the Australian authorities were ‘acquainted with the organised activity of the Croatian fascist <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> and were, to say the least, tolerant towards them’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, they may be attached to diplomatic services and operate from there, and secondly, they pose as ordinary <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> and then operate among the migrant population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I acknowledge that the 2 sets of circumstances do not necessarily equate, but I am interested in the fact that the Bill spells out that one of the functions of the Corporation is to facilitate the settlement in the area of <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Since the first settlers arrived this country has been peopled by successive waves of <span class="highlight">immigrants</span>, largely from Europe but also from many other parts of the world, and now, quite apart from any future immigration policy that we may follow, we have a community which is multi-racial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These poor people who are living in hamlets have the choice virtually of being turfed out of the country to which they have given 10 or 15 years good service or being on the run as illegal <span class="highlight">immigrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even as late as the period after the Second World War vast numbers of <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> came to this country from Britain, Western Europe and even northern Europe because the conditions of working people in this country were much better than the conditions which could be found in The Netherlands, Belgium, West Germany or, for that matter, Italy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the reasons they stopped coming here, one of the reasons it became almost impossible to obtain <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> from Western Europe and one of the reasons the previous Government stretched the White Australia Policy to include Turks was because it could not get people to come here from countries such as Austria, West Germany and other parts of Western Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that with the large number of <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> in Australia, many of whom speak only a limited amount of English, it is necessary that there should be some sort of interpreter service for them, particularly when they are asking questions which to them can be very complicated and when they are not aware of the laws relating to social security in Australia and what their entitlements are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As it has been such a success, it would seem to me to be very important that provincial centres such as Geelong, Ballarat, Wollongong and Newcastle, where there are large numbers of <span class="highlight">immigrants</span>, should have the same service provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it correct, as reported, that most Rhodesians do not carry Rhodesian passports; if so, are a fair proportion of South African <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> Rhodesians; if so, does thc Government make a distinction in its figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-11">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that trade unionists and others are constantly leaving the gaols of Santiago and looking for sanctuary, does the Government feel that we have reached a limit with Chilean <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> in that category or is Australia still in the field to receive them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is apparent that the Government is being hustled, particularly by the Perth land developer Alan Bond, and also by W. D.

    <p>Readers of the  National Times  were served up by  Mr Bond,  by W. D.

    <p>I suppose that the nearest one could get to guest workers in Australia is in some selected areas where there has been and is gross exploitation of some illegal <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> by some unscrupulous employers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will be aware that over a period I have insisted that the Government ‘s broad immigration policy needs constant monitoring to ensure that, however we categorise people who are suffering from economic or political suppression and kindred problems, we have an even balance in our intake of <span class="highlight">immigrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter comes down to a consideration of the ratio of <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> we take from various countries under our evenhanded policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both sections 13 and 14 refer not to aliens being deported but rather to <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> being able to be deported in certain circumstances there set out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well established that, as a matter of Federal constitutional law, persons can continue to be regarded as <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> if they are born overseas and have come here from overseas, even after they have been naturalised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is because the deportation sections in question, namely sections 13 and 14 of the Migration Act, bite on people as <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> rather than by virtue of their being aliens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another point raised by  Senator Mulvihill  regarding prohibited <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> was a question with regard to the source of the estimate of approximately 57,000 prohibited <span class="highlight">immigrants</span>- figures which were given, I think, at the Estimates Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is no doubt that our illegal <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> do number many tens of thousands, and that the number is growing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be brutally frank, I asked a leading question that came partly within the responsibility of the Department of Foreign Affairs and partly within the responsibility of the Department of Immigration about <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> to Australia who could have been involved in nazi collaboration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs advise this Senate why, when there is high unemployment all over Australia and especially in the provincial centres, this Government has the Australian Embassy place advertisements such as it did recently with a daily newspaper in Hamburg, Germany, calling for <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> in such classifications as computer programmers and operators, mechanical fitters, mechanics, turners and fitters, boilermakers, refrigeration mechanics, plumbers, carpenters, butchers, pastrycooks, bakers and ladies hairdressers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Second Front- Jennifer McCallum, Melbourne; the National Front; the Australian National Alliance- ‘Audacity’; the National Resistance- ‘Advance’; the Divine People Movement, Sydney; the Campaign Against Illegal <span class="highlight">Immigrants</span>, Perth; Awake Australians Campaign to Help Save South Africa; Zimmunism; Rights for Whites- that is a cute one; and One Law for All. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Migration Act, Sections 12, 13 and 48- Deportation of aliens and <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> and directions not to act as immigration agent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is he aware that at present large numbers of vacancies are being filled by IndoChinese <span class="highlight">immigrants</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is populated by <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> who have arrived chiefly since the Second World War. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not surprisingly, with a war in progress in Kampuchea only 300 kilometres from the conference room, and the threat of a further influx of Khmer Rouge refugees into Thailand as soon as the rains stopped later in October, the issue of ‘illegal <span class="highlight">immigrants</span>’ occupied the minds- of delegates above all else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ASEAN requests resettlement countries to increase and hasten the intake of the refugees and illegal <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> from Vietnam, Kampuchea and Laos who have been provided temporary asylum in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines and Singapore; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Minister, during the Liberal Party Conference held in Perth in April 1 979, state that he did not consider the boat people’ to be illegal <span class="highlight">immigrants</span>; if so: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Refugees who are permitted entry to Australia are not prohibited <span class="highlight">immigrants</span> for the purposes of the Migration Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-2">[More…]</a></p>
