    <p>As the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition says, words of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> are undesirable, but at this stage I cannot rule that they are unparliamentary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By the very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the separate and individual powers given to the States in Australia it was inevitable that jealousies would arise and that conflict in ideas of development would occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These provisions authorise deductions for expenditure incurred in producing assessable income, but specifically preclude the allowance of deductions for outgoings which are of a capital, private or domestic <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-32-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Decisions of Taxation Boards of Review have established that expenditure incurred by a taxpayer on a course of study undertaken with a view to acquiring academic qualifications, or to enable him to take up a career, is of a private or capital <span class="highlight">nature</span> and is not deductible for income tax purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-32-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other point raised in the honourable gentleman’s question is whether the proposed Bill will be one, as it were, which stands on its own feet as a separate Cheques Bill or whether on the other hand it will be in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of an amendment to the Bills of Exchange Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, in view of the predominantly interstate <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Commonwealth Railways’ system the existing Commonwealth benefit is of limited value to pensioners and the Government has been investigating the possibility of affording relief for those pensioners travelling interstate over the TransAustralian and Central Australian railways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable gentleman will be disappointed to learn that no report of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> was made by  Sir Keith  Waller, the former Ambassador to the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I regret it all the more because of the special <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the position held by the Leader of the House  (Mr Snedden). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the House this morning he clarified that report bysaying that he did not know of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is extraordinarily absentminded, extraordinarily neglectful of his duties, if he did not know the general <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further, he told the House that he had no knowledge of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Two hours before, the 2 precise clauses were identified and in fact 7 hours before that the general <span class="highlight">nature</span> of them was indicated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe very wide freedom has been given in the terms and <span class="highlight">nature</span> of amendments moved in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I quote from page 407:  lt is important to observe that the question whether the proposition contained in  a  superseded motion has been decided depends, not upon the fact that its words have been omitted, but rather upon the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the amendment by which the motion has been superseded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There must be many honourable members on the other side of the House who would sympathise with the honourable member for Wills and who would have accepted what he put forward as the proper course to take under provocation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is true, but what one looks for is the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the association, it is not just the juxtaposition which makes the guilt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Bearing in mind the injustice of the receipts tax - it is based on a flat rate and it affects all people, particularly those who are least able to pay, namely, pensioners and people on fixed incomes - can he now indicate the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the growth factor which he has in mind, and can he explain why it would not be sufficient to obviate the necessity of presenting validating legislation in this chamber? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst the recommendations are acceptable I still feel that sufficient inquiry of an independent <span class="highlight">nature</span> has not been conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a country enjoying the universal affluence which is the experience of the vast majority of the community and where there are constant temptations for young people to spend their money, it is a real source of gratification to all members of the Government that the homes savings grant scheme has focused the savings habit among the younger members of the community towards a home and away from things of a less permanent .and less fundamental <span class="highlight">nature</span> than owning their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reason people have not been prepared to invest in housing is not because of risk but because it has been relatively more profitable to invest in short term lending, such as hire purchase and matters of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>, where people can turn over their money quickly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">nature</span> of this fire was such that it would need to have been contained at the very moment it started or it would have been beyond the capacity of any fire fighting installation, no matter how large it was, to control it when we bear in mind such things as the explosion of propane gas, the explosion of oxy-acetylene cylinders and the other inflammable material that necessarily lies around the hull of a big ship which, by its very shape, causes a profound draught that serves very much to accelerate the force of the fire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely it would have been possible to put a proviso in the Income Tax Act to deal with allowances in the same way as the Government is providing now in relation to probate that the advantages will not accrue unless a certain part of the total activities is primary in <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is why we have taken, the opportunity not to give so much attention to the little benefit that the Bill will provide but to try to draw the attention of the House to the serious <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the problems that are now upon us and the impact that existing and prevailing systems of taxation - both income tax and estate and probate duties - have upon us and to suggest why a measure as small as this, even though it may concede benefits somewhere, is still not fundamentally facing up to the critical problems of the agricultural, primary or rural sections of the community which are still important for their own sakes, for the sakes of the people who live in them and for the sake of the future expansion of the Australian economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I consider that such a procedure is necessary in order that when a Bill of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> is presented to the House there will be an informed body of opinion, based on solid research, which will be able to determine whether the legislation is worth while. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Government will give an assurance that if a merger takes place in this industry in the name of rationalisation the Government Aircraft Factories will retain a controlling interest in any merged industry, because it is an industry which at this stage is engaged solely in operations of a defence <span class="highlight">nature</span>, lt is an industry which can justify its existence only by defence needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If periodically those people who have developed skills in the industry are to be wiped out by retrenchment or the up and down <span class="highlight">nature</span> of employment in the industry over recent years we will not have an industry if and when we require it - heaven forbid that we do - for national defence purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thus these teams, though they were able to observe the steady and continuous arrival of war material, including aircraft carriers with helicopters on board, were unable, in view of the denial of controls, to determine precisely the quantum and <span class="highlight">nature</span> of war material unloaded and introduced into South Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On page 7 of the report there is a break-down of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the exports that are insured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the United Kingdom’s experience can be taken as n guide, most of this finance is of a short term <span class="highlight">nature</span> but the United Kingdom, like other countries exporting capita! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The resources of the Corporation are available to banks which are providing medium to longterm finance for exports of a capital <span class="highlight">nature</span>, and ensures that finance is not a limiting factor in the development of that field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that we take a longer term view in the decade now beginning and diversify the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of our exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, there was hesitation on the part of certain manufacturers and from one’s own experience there can be no denying the cautious <span class="highlight">nature</span> in which the Australian trading banks, including the Government owned and directed Commonwealth Trading Bank, moved into accepting the insurance paper of EPIC as collateral security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore the comments I make are somewhat general in <span class="highlight">nature</span> and I hope they will be a prelude to a fuller debate at a later stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It had to accept what the Minister aptly called degradation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The information was available to the Commonwealth but, in view of its confidential <span class="highlight">nature</span> as far as the Queensland Gevernment is concerned, we cannot disclose it here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only comment I can make is that, because of the confidential <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the information asked for by the honourable member, we cannot provide it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The dilatory <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the approach of the Government to the national art gallery is reflected even in the appointment of the Interim Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But surely in this field the honourable member realises that in a forum of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> the employee and the employer have every right to put the respective cases to the Commission, and that when the Commission makes its decision we should abide by it because this is the machinery set up in this country to deal with such matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are concerned about is the prospect of propagating at public expense information which is not of a neutral <span class="highlight">nature</span> from a public standpoint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed publicity about the new health benefits plan will not be of a political <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Commonwealth benefit is payable to any person for medical treatment of a <span class="highlight">nature</span> covered by the First Schedule.’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are proposing that the Commonwealth benefit should be payable to any person for medical treatment of a <span class="highlight">nature</span> covered by these items detailed in the First Schedule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Expenditure o a capital <span class="highlight">nature</span> and expenditure in respect of administrative expenses (including the remuneration of members of committees established under this Act) incurred by or on behalf of the Commonwealth for the purposes of this Act shall be paid out of monies from time to time appropriated by the Parliament for the purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the reasons why I refer to this matter is that at the present time the pensioner medical service in our view is totally inadequate in that it provides for services of a general practitioner <span class="highlight">nature</span> but not those of a specialist <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the pensioner medical service remains limited to services of a general practitioner <span class="highlight">nature</span> and is not to be updated or upgraded in any way at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The treatment required was of a fairly serious <span class="highlight">nature</span> and was fairly urgent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The larger open schemes operating in Australia are inefficient because they in fact do these things which we criticise, lt is inherent in their <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All in all there are fairly large diseconomies in the way they operate because of this general inefficiency which is part and parcel of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the competition between these funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to the Minister that any cuts occurring in Government expenditure in Canada today are of a general <span class="highlight">nature</span> and arc part of the austerity measures introduced by the Trudeau Government in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of that - and the Minister will be well aware of this because I brought this point to his notice as a result of communications I had with the Minister for Health in Canada - the health services in Canada operate on a provincial basis and their <span class="highlight">nature</span> varies from province to province. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact there will not be a reduction in the expenditure on provincial health services and this is the essential <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the point T was discussing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extraordinarily aggressive <span class="highlight">nature</span> of man ensures that democracy is  a  somewhat fragile affair, even if it does not appear fragile to us living in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The moral decisions involved must appear agonisingly difficult to all except those who have very simple minded views of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of man and society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only the people who have extremely simple minded views of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of man and society who will see this clearly as black and white. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difficulties in operating these ships are such that there is, as I understand it at the moment, only one trade in the world currently served by a similar vessel and the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the operation consequently in terms of its efficiency and economy cannot be firmly established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not specifically counted the number of questions, many of them of a highly detailed <span class="highlight">nature</span> involving many hundreds of hours of work on the part of senior departmental officers, that the Leader of the Opposition has placed on the notice paper in respect of my Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not on this occasion allow the discussion to be side-tracked on the racist questions and other things of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When considering the importance of a debate of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>, I find it rather remarkable that I am the third honourable member on the Government side to speak when there has hot been a single  speaker  from the Opposition side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with the usual approach adopted in business activities of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>, the commission will adopt a policy aimed at obtaining sufficient revenue from the sale of products to cover the expenditure of the commission plus a reasonable return on the capital invested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will readily concede that one must expect drug costs to increase at a much faster rate than is the case for other normally accepted cost of living indices because of the complex and extremely expensive <span class="highlight">nature</span> of research and development of pharmaceutical drugs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another feature of the Bill is that in disposing of land, the man whose property is being built-up will be able to obtain that land at current market value taking into account the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the proposed land use and the system of tenure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In return, the State would agree to operate the scheme in such a way that, taking into account its experience with other schemes of an analogous <span class="highlight">nature</span>, and the normal expectations that I have just mentioned, the amounts recovered could be reasonably expected to equal the State’s costs of administration and payment of interest and capital to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there is need for some new developments in this field and I regret that the word ‘services’, indicating that the Minister might be thinking of some new developments of a private enterprise <span class="highlight">nature</span> in this field, is not included in that clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In introducing legislation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> the Government fully demonstrates that it is in no way debarred by some antiquated preconception of what capitalism is about from bringing forth legislation which will benefit the people of Australia even if it happens to be in accord with the overall philosophy of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the honourable gentleman aware that where a spouse works and employs a domestic servant the outgoing is interpreted as being an expense of a private and personal <span class="highlight">nature</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the legislation, the boundaries between Commonwealth and State jurisdiction, the joint legislation, a further meeting, what date it was to bc, who would attend it - he was party to the lot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I also add one final point: Despite the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of these conclusions my researches in this matter have given me a new appreciation of the negotiating skill of the honourable member for Farrer and have increased the high regard which I have always had for his integrity and personal qualities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it would appear that something will be concocted in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of a suggestion that the matter be stood over for a period of 6 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One cannot be too forthright in a matter of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> because there are other people around the table who have their own views, but 1 personally would like to be absolutely sure that there will be no legislation presented to the Commonwealth Parliament which would face us with a fait accompli as far as the continental shelf is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did want to refer to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the relations which I believe have given rise to this confrontation today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another was the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the discussions which were appropriate to legislation of a type which was foreshadowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the relations between the Commonwealth and the States that is important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to advance the view that the matter before the Chair is of a <span class="highlight">nature</span> that warrants the support of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a matter of whether the States or the Commonwealth should pass laws of certain kinds, which of the 2 sets of government was to have all authority in which areas, what were to be the limits and what Was to be the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Government concluded that the responsibility for the work of ACT law reform should rest with the responsible departments, it decided that arrangements should be made for consultation on matters of a specialist or technical <span class="highlight">nature</span> to take place with informed sections of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the House will, 1 think, be interested to know that since 1967 my own Department has been responsible for some 30 significant ordinances of a law reform <span class="highlight">nature</span> - some of them representing quite major projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the definitions clause, clause 3, the intention of the refinition ‘of capital equipment of an educational <span class="highlight">nature</span>’ is that where the need for special classes is established State and independent schools will be provided with Commonwealth funds to purchase equipment of the language laboratory type. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can he also provide the number who are suffering from (a) multiple and (b) single handicaps and indicate the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the handicaps in each case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-31-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he give the sources and the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the data from which the answers in this question have been compiled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-31-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number suffering from multiple and single handicaps was not given in the survey report and details of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the illness were not published for the relevant age groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-31-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">nature</span> and extent of the subsidy varies between States and between organisations within a State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-31-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not quite certain of the details, but T believe that that is the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is believed within the department, and I think with justification, that if a charge of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> were applied there would be a considerable increase in the number of long distance calls which at the moment are trunk calls and a considerable reduction in the number of local calls made by subscribers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In reality we ask of them on the one hand to fulfil the role of the hewers of wood and carters of water in the medical services, and on the other hand expect them equally to rise to the occasion in response to demands of a complex, technical and quite advanced <span class="highlight">nature</span> in their role as professionals in our medical services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A nurse trained to perform complex, skilled techniques such as giving intravenous solutions receives a jar to her sense of professionalism and to her pride in technical skill when she is relegated to dull, intellectually undemanding tasks of a monotonous, repetitive <span class="highlight">nature</span> such as cleaning bedpans or sputum mugs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I want to make is that it will not be sufficient to pass a Bill of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> unless we are also prepared to act to protect those export markets which we already have by providing adequate facilities to ensure that- the quality of our exports is up to the standards demanded by the receiving countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are a number of reasons why Australia needs not only a corporation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> but also a government with an imaginative approach to our economic problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill has the support of the Opposition because the Opposition believes that a corporation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> is absolutely necessary in our economic conditions as they exist now and as they have existed for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so I would like to ask a few questions, some of them of a rather fundamental <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As is well known, the Australian Labor Party has supported an institution of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> for some time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main difficulty ] see about it - 1 am rather astonished at the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the criticism from honourable members on the Government side - is that it is a pigmy in its initial conception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The advances through those organisations in Japan and South Africa are for different purposes, according to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the economy concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my mind it is essential that there be some body in Australia, some corporation which is able to generate from overseas, by virtue of the very high standing that a corporation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> will have, money which can be invested in ventures which are virtually at (he launching pad in terms of growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there is at this stage a very real opportunity for Australia to achieve world scale in many of its secondary industries through the operation of a corporation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that a corporation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> is the ideal instrument by which this can be achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we think of the order of overseas investment in Australia and think of the $ 1,000m approximately that has been coming into Australia each year in recent years, we can see that what has been constituted is a corporation not of a gigantic size but one of a <span class="highlight">nature</span> which I believe and which the Government believes will be able specifically to complement those other facilities that are available within the money mechanisms of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am thinking in terms of wool processing in the future - and to facilitate industrial development on a scale large enough to expand exports of an industrial <span class="highlight">nature</span> on a world wide industrial competitive basis; to help earn foreign exchange and so assist our balance of payments situation which will need watching, according to the figures that have already been given to us projecting future requirements of foreign exchange into the 1970’s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In other words, I hope to insert in the Bill - 1 feel that I will be unsuccessful - a provision whereby the Corporation shall be in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of a lender of last resort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>for the purpose of the preceding paragraph the Corporation shall be deemed to be in a position where it is able to control the affairs of a company if it holds more than fifteen per cent of the issued capital of the company except where the equity acquired by the Corporation is in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of bridging finance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This question which is directly related to Questions No 527 and 781 asked by the honourable member on 9lh April 1970 and 16th April 1970 respectively, involves a question of future Government policy, and as indicated in the replies given on those occasions, it is impracticable to provide an answer to a question of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In particular, I refer to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the representation by his Department, by the Ministry and by the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-0-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Allegations of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> which are the subject of the Minister’s statement must always be taken seriously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us clarify the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of these allegations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the essence of the pernicious <span class="highlight">nature</span> of paternalism that decisions are made and influence is exercised from misguided good faith or from the assumption that those who have always exercised power know best how power should be exercised; or that those who have made decisions on behalf of others cannot accept the possibility that decisions could be made for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, it has been found that it is no longer necessary to have a statutory committee of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the time 1 introduced those proposals I explained at some length the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the changes involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition to the matters I have mentioned the Bill clarifies the provisions of the Act in regard to the limits for this time during which both allowances in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of salary and electorate allowance are payable to members and senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whether this should be a tribunal consisting of a number of people representing interested parties or 1 person, perhaps to be designated Milk Commissioner, it should have the power to arbitrate in the disputes which have become all too common and hence cannot be considered in any sense to be of a passing <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I emphasise that I make no criticism of the officers of the Commonwealth Department nor, indeed, of the department carrying out that particular policy, but it does seem to me quite proper to say that at this stage of our development the Commonwealth perhaps should be taking a greater particular interest in the carrying out of projects of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The criteria to be applied to the question of such recognition will be specialist registration under State or Territory law or, in other cases, the medical practitioner’s qualifications, his experience and standing in the medical profession and the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of his practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I addressed this Committee when it was first formed some 6 weeks ago and one of the things I asked it to do as a matter of urgency was to bring forward a report as to the reasons for the present low price of wool and to make other suggestions of a temporary <span class="highlight">nature</span> which might alleviate the serious position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That all words after That’ be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: whilst not opposing the provisions of the Bill, the House is of opinion that a national inquiry should be conducted to identify the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and extent of mental and physical handicaps in children, as a basis to the Commonwealth establishing a national policy for handicapped children involving Commonwealth and State Governments, local authorities and private agencies in co-operative action’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Talking about a subsidy of $2 for every $1 of capital expenditure or of expenditure on special equipment is not the way to get an informed attitude on the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and extent of mental retardation in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Furthermore, if it is one of the wishful hopes of this Government to induce local government to undertake responsibilities of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>, 1 want to say that most municipalities are now practically bankrupt and they have been telling this Government for many years that they can no longer carry out the responsibilities which they now have to face up to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is important for the Parliament, when considering a Bill of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>, to know the extent to which the Department has applied itself to this work, perhaps at the request of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In order to answer the honourable member’s question, it would be necessary, first, to identify every charge of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> and then examine the record of proceedings for the purpose of seeing whether the charge bore any relationship to demonstrations or to activities of the kind mentio’ned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-29-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this connection I might mention that the Premiers have indcated that, in the absence of Commonwealth legislation to impose receipts duty where it is in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of an excise, the States would be unlikely to be able to impose receipts duty where it is not in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of an excise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of this Bill, which is in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of a precautionary measure, is to obtain authority to borrow from the Reserve Bank the amount required to complete the financing of the deficit in 1969-70, if this proves to be necessary, and to expend the proceeds of the borrowing for defence purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700605_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Members of this Parliament who represent the federal electorates of Leichhardt, Kalgoorlie, Northern Territory and others of a like <span class="highlight">nature</span> have considerable difficulty in providing a personal service to their constituents because of the vast and isolated conformation of the districts they represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I advised the House on 4th March last, the recommendations of the Nimmo Committee regarding hospital benefits had implications of such a far reaching <span class="highlight">nature</span> that the Government is not in a position to make decisions on them at this stage and will not be able to until the States’ attitudes have been clarified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As 1 indicated in the statement I made to the House, the Government is not prepared, nor is it reasonable to expect it to do so, to change a long standing policy of this kind without having an opportunity for investigation of the proposed change in detail, along with questions of a similar <span class="highlight">nature</span>, such as the provision generally of ancillary medical services under the health benefits plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This and other matters affecting the provision of these services are being negotiated with the Australian Dental Association with a view to developing an agreed procedure for identifying oral surgeons and the Government therefore is not disposed to accept an amendment of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> proposed at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I understand him correctly, he stated that the only way in which the Government felt it could be certain that the treatment provided was of a quasi-surgical <span class="highlight">nature</span> was for it to be done in the operating theatre of a hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is demonstrably true that men are by their very <span class="highlight">nature</span> creative beings who derive satisfaction from the willing performance of productive activities and there is no doubt that work on the Snowy Mountains scheme, by virtue of its national importance, by virtue of the magnitude of the tasks undertaken and by virtue of the inherent challenge to those in both higher and lower echelons, inspired the work force, just as their success inspired the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this case this is continuing a practice that has been in existence as far as the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority is concerned, lt has worked well for a period of 20 years for the Authority and we hope that it will continue to operate in exactly the same way for the future, lt has not been unduly restrictive where the Authority has been operating in fields of a <span class="highlight">nature</span> similar to those in which the Corporalion will be operating in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The reason for the Opposition moving the amendment in the first instance and, 1 take it, the reason why the Senate accepted the amendment, was that the provision refers to cases where workers compensation claims, third party claims or cases of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> have arisen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am reminded that the honourable member for Barton  (Mr Reynolds),  when this Bill was before the House on a previous occasion, raised in a very trenchant manner the question of the timetable proposed by the Government for its undertaking in respect to a review of the various services or a review of the possibility of bringing into the national health scheme those services which are paramedical in <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe the 4 points he laid down - the need to improve the Board’s composition by research and matters of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> - are important ones which Labor will give effect to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore the Country Party says that primary industry should have price support for surpluses of goods that are sold overseas of a <span class="highlight">nature</span> that will give the same financial advantage as secondary industry is getting through tariffs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">nature</span> of these tariffs and other forms of protection that will come from this kind of work is the type of system existing in West Germany and Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To believe that Australia is in some way a more protected country than Japan or West Germany is to misunderstand completely the sophisticated <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the protection existing in those countries, lt is time we woke up to this sort of thing and realise that those who blithely talk about Australia being over protected apparently talk about Australia being over protected in relation, to Japan or some other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It means that if a tax of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> is being imposed in New South Wales and Victoria a tax appropriate to Tasmania’s capacity ought to be imposed there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is desired that a tax of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> not exist, the only solution would be to give back a proportion of income taxation powers to the States, lt is perfectly clear from recent conferences that Premiers do not want back income taxation powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If a State has a large proportion of its activity directed to direct export activities and if it does not go through many hands - one can think, of course, of the great mineral States, the States from which the great exports are generated within the Commonwealth - there are fewer interchanges of goods and there are fewer chances to levy a tax of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In some ways there is something to be said for the integration of some of the facilities in Papua and New Guinea with our own facilities but it is time that the people of Papua and New Guinea had some kind of internal banking system of a more sophisticated <span class="highlight">nature</span> than they have at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I want to say to the honourable member for Grayndler and also to the honourable member for Bowman  (Mr Keogh)  that I think it can be fairly said that the suggestion which they have put forward concerning the establishment of a joint committee of both Houses of the Parliament to investigate the areas which are the subject matters before the committees which have been established is based upon a misapprehension as to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The war aim in this non-war in Vietnam now appears to be to disengage, but the unlimited <span class="highlight">nature</span> of a commitment on the mainland of Asia and the carelessly undefined obligations assumed towards the South Vietnamese Government appear to make this impossible to he Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But he did point out for some reason, for which he gave no explanation either, that the increase of 2i per cent would not apply to motor vehicles of a commercial <span class="highlight">nature</span> and further that the present rate of 15 per cent tax which is applied to a large number of unspecified goods would remain unaltered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are neither in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of a fixed proprietary interest, as in the case of a share, nor can it be said that they are true interests covered by a debenture, which is another name for a mortgage on the assets of a company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He made a number of suggestions and I would like to point out that because of the complex <span class="highlight">nature</span> of income tax law and all tax law it is easy to take an example from here and an example from there, put them together and show an inequality or an inequitable position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do so because we now find that where the most relief is required - that is for people on the low incomes where the tax burden has been the hardest or has had the heaviest effect - is where the least relief of a real <span class="highlight">nature</span> has been given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But what I did notice was, if I might call it, the ecumenical <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the attack in the Legislative Council because, if I remember correctly and have read the report correctly, a leading member of the Labor Party in the Legislative Council,  Mr Galbally,  who, up until he spoke the other night, had been, I gather, adhering to Labor policy regarding State aid, seemed on this occasion to be diverting greatly from Labor policy which no doubt may lead to another inquiry into the Labor Party Executive in Victoria, because he did indicate that the Federal Government was overriding, was subjecting the States to control of a financial oligarchy and was in many other ways, according to his lights, misbehaving itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This arrangement was consistent with the Government’s policy at that time of not providing financial assistance for degree courses in colleges of advanced education in the Stales.In the meantime the Government sponsored an inquiry into the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and classification of awards in colleges of advanced education by a committee under the chairmanship of  Mr F.

    <p>It will be most unlikely that the Commonwealth would have to claim clean up costs in relation to non-persistent oils, as, by their very <span class="highlight">nature</span>, they evaporate before cleaning up would be necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having done this it is then possible to increase considerably the penalties for noncompliance with a notice, and to provide for penalties of a recurring <span class="highlight">nature</span> to apply daily whether or not oil escapes from the ship on that particular day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ideally in a democracy information concerning the activities of Government and policy decisions should be open to all so that the people can know the changing <span class="highlight">nature</span> of their rights and privileges as decided by their elected representatives, so that an informed and adequate public debate can take place on policy issues and so that checks and balances are available on the activities of governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I merely draw attention to these facts but I also recognise that paragraphs 48 and 49 of the report recommend that some steps of an immediate <span class="highlight">nature</span> be taken by the Government to plan for a facility for commercial jet pilot training in some other locality.I will see that this is referred to my colleague the Minister for Civil Aviation  (Senator Cotton)  in another place and I can give an assurance to the House that the Minister will study the recommendation that has been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has, I would say, an exceptionally enlightened group of people con cerned about education within  i’.iL  community as one might expect having regard to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the community, and we believe there should be 3 representatives of the Canberra community on the governing Council of the College of Advanced Education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To a much greater degree the colleges of advanced education are, as I understand it, advised and defined, or should be defined, to cope with problems of a more applied <span class="highlight">nature</span> - accounting courses, business management and matters of that kind and many other fields which would come to mind if one applied oneself to the task. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But in both of those categories it is absolutely essential that we should be paying as much as we can pay because we are talking here - and T make no bones about this or apologies for saying it - of the best qualified people hi the community in terms of educational qualifications; in terms of what should be paid for having a certificate or passing an examination or something ot that <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it would be wrong to end my speech on a Bill of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> without again referring to the enormity of the tragedy of the Government’s venture into the purchase of an aircraft such as the Fill, for which we have now paid more than $200m and for which we are still meeting interest payments although we have not yet received one of the aircraft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are some of the reasons why the Opposition believes that a Bill of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> deserves a far greater explanation and a more concise and objective explanation from the Minister for Defence, particularly when the Bill involves this kind of borrowing and having in mind the unhappy situation which has applied in this country in relation to the procurement of defence equipment overseas by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as I can tell from an examination of the regulations - I am the first to admit that the complex <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the regulations makes it difficult to follow them completely - the House should reject this regulation because it expands the number of people who will be caught up in the system and it makes it a little more difficult for perhaps a small number of young Australians and I do not believe that is socially desirable or politically just. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the Committee will agree with me, upon due deliberation, that that principle upon which, generally speaking, retrospective laws are not favoured simply does not apply in a case involving people who for years, indeed ever since federation, have ordered their affairs on the assumption that the laws made by the State Parliaments, unless specifically directed - which they never were - to Commonwealth places, had a general application in those places; so it could not be said that people committing activities of a criminal <span class="highlight">nature</span> were undertaking those activities in the belief that they would be exempt from criminal law in relation to those activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the time each of the various Tariff Proposals was introduced relating to the alterations now incorporated in this Bill the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the changes was explained at some length. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am also aware that some of the apparent over-reactions of the police are caused by the unseen spike applied to the hindquarters of the policeman’s horse, and things of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, I have to expect from those remarks that if there was a blatant misuse of authority by the police or someone of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>, quite clearly people will react to that, just as the police may react to such a situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are categories which, because of the arbitrary <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the criteria, mean that people who certainly have suffered financially are not necessarily included within the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately in any sort of scheme of an arbitrary <span class="highlight">nature</span> it is obvious that one will find it very hard to embrace all the circumstances which one would desire to assist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The magistrate in the case went to the extent of saying that the Parliament of Victoria had recently expressed its views of the seriousness of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of this offence and that was why he was imposing a sentence of 14 days without any alternative of a fine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that  the  honourable member for Diamond Valley  (Mr Brown)  indicated the difficulties in which people faced with  a  situation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> would be when he said that he had never practised - or  whatever  one does - in a court of petty sessions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Well, I suggest to the honourable member that if he looks very closely at this Bill he will see that this is the very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A Bill of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> does not create public order and it does not sustain order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Bill of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> is an insult to individuals and to minority groups in Australia because it directly throws down the gauntlet to them and calls upon them to challenge this sort of Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But even more important than the Bill are the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and the actions of the Government that has produced the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I should think beyond any doubt the police are entitled to put an end to a procession, a meeting, or a gathering if they apprehend, notwithstanding its lawful <span class="highlight">nature</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Unreasonable obstruction’ means an act or thing done by a person that constitutes, or contributes to, an obstruction of, or interference with, the exercise or enjoyment by other personsof their lawful rights or privileges (including rights of passage along the public streets) where, having regard to all the circumstances of the obstruction or interference, including its place, time, duration and <span class="highlight">nature</span>, it constitutes an unreasonable obstruction or interference, and ‘unreasonably obstructs’ has a corresponding meaning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given that the Government has spelt out one right and left the other as a sort of residue, is it not only human <span class="highlight">nature</span> for the magistrate, with the ordinary prejudices of humankind, to say: ‘What is reasonable must be read in the context of the paramount right, the primary right, which is the right of free passage’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again in the definition, to make sure that the position of the demonstrator, the dissenter, or the person who is assembling or obstructing a street is safeguarded, it is said that regard must be had to all the circumstances of the obstruction or interference, including its place, time, duration and <span class="highlight">nature</span> before a determination can be made that an act constitutes an unreasonable interference with the rights of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask honourable members to reflect on the barbaric <span class="highlight">nature</span> of such a law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the Department estimates that currently some 10,000 ‘investigations’ of such cases may occur annually; the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the investigations varies greatly, ranging from a routine but not necessarily readily obtainable check, for example, of a man’s birfhdate, to cases involving extended police enquiries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The provision of precise information of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> sought by the honourable member regarding such ‘investigations’ would require the diversion of staff resources which is not considered justified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To put the matter into context, the experience over a 5-year period shows that there has not been a rise of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> but a rise of about 17 per cent, which is a far slower rate of increase in the cost of materials than has occurred, for example, in indices of average earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But, as with all works of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> costing more than $750,000, the matter would have to be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works before any consideration could be given to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to make one more general comment on the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of supplementary appropriations such as those we dealt with earlier this week, and on our inadequate and even improper treatment of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I read in Tuesday’s Senate Hansard of reference to documents of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> I went to the House of Representatives Bills and Papers Office and asked for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the long delay and injustice which have characterized the Government’s behaviour in the matters mentioned above, it is essential that the Government should make a speedy statement as to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the increases and the date when they will come into effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is bringing the parliamentary institution into disrepute to expect honourable members to discuss and debate Bills of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> intelligently in those circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the scheme and the multiplicity of competing organisations an extravagant level of reserves has been built up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the present scheme this is pretty much unavoidable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Today, as they have done in the past, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  repeated references to matters of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> and, of course, we all have complete sympathy for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I also find it difficult to understand how a question of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> can be put through the Parliament and how we can limit debate by allocating such a restricted time to consider matters of such importance as the Compensation (Commonwealth Employees) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the comparatively recent <span class="highlight">nature</span> of political activity at a national level, many of the new members will be untrained in the ways and workings of a national parliament and therefore would be in a less favourable position initially when taking part in debates in the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In talking about self-government in detail or in general, for New Guinea or anywhere else, and in considering paternalism and things of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>, it seems to me that we could be on no firmer ground than to adopt and to concur with the provisions understood and recommended by the people themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Quite clearly if a judgment about the long term price of wool rests on this difficult 25c-30c-35c range the Government will be faced with a range of difficult decisions which will open up a fundamental analysis of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of government support for rural industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I turn now to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dawson  (Dr Patterson)  and perhaps more particularly to the remarks made by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie  (Mr Collard)  and his discussion of a moratorium and a stay of proceedings in respect of debt and hire purchase commitments and other things of a like <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we go through the views of the South Australian Government, the New South Wales Government, the Queensland Government and the various farmers unions of Australia we find that all of them have said that this legislation is totally inadequate, firstly because of the limited amount that is to be provided and secondly because of the very restrictive <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the legislation which is aimed at ensuring that only the very smallest number of farmers are to benefit, from it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Question 539, asked by the honourable member, was similar in <span class="highlight">nature</span> and the reply to that question occupied 49 pages of Hansard (Hansard, 10.3.71, pp 762-810). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I accept that, by the very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of public affairs, most legislation must be prepared in the half light. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One may say that this is in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of inducement, but how does one test it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another point that 1 think is well worth mentioning is the complicated <span class="highlight">nature</span> of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, in view of the length and technical <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the provisions, it has been decided that a separate piece of legislation would be preferable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Naval, military and Air Force was brought into legislation originally framed without regard tu the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of that service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the administration of such a scheme? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can appreciate the need for the grant of some $60m to compensate for the loss of the receipts duties that the States would otherwise have collected in the period from October 1970 to 30th June 1971, but which were made invalid by a decision of the High Court of Australia, which regarded them, insofar as they did not apply to wages and salaries, as a payment in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of an excise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, as it was in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of an excise it was within the competence only of the Commonwealth to collect them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, honourable members on both sides of the House have had quite numerous representations made to them recently by local governing authorities suggesting that payments should be made directly from the Commonwealth to the local authorities to assist them in such works as the abatement of rates to people in receipt of age pen sions, the provision of certain social welfare services such as child minding centres and baby health centres, and the various kinds of relief work that local authorities are called upon to perform in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of social services but for which no direct payment is made to the local authorities and which has to be met out of their rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate, in its report on this matter, pointed out quite clearly that the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of these problems was such that they could not be handled merely at State or local levels and that they ought to be regarded as national problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be said that that is for private ward accommodation, but of course there are people who, although they do not wish to have the luxury, have to go into private accommodation at $196 per week because of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of their illness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>J rise at this late hour when two more Bills listed on the notice paper are still to be discussed tonight, to record my disappointment that this is the second Bill of a finan cial <span class="highlight">nature</span> that has come before the House in the dying hours of this sessional period on which no Government member has seen fit to talk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless, as I see it, we appear to have here something of an industrial parallel with the balance of <span class="highlight">nature</span> theme that is found in other areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My own view is that it is possible for it to be claimed that in the absence of the publication of any specific information relating to Cabinet discussion or in the absence of any attribution of points of view to particular Cabinet members there is technically no breach, but 1 believe that there does not have to be PaY specific action of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> to constitute a breach of the vital principle involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710817_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the consequences is that in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of things, a career as a private or as a non commissioned officer in the Army is not a way of life that appeals to people who have gone through to tertiary education or perhaps even to higher secondary education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this chamber we scarcely examine taxation measures at all, yet there are many areas which are crying out for examination and the type of investigation which could be satisfactorily carried out only by a committee of the House, such as the regressive <span class="highlight">nature</span> of income tax deductions; whether the tax deductions which are allowed should be from taxable income or from tax payable; whether income in kind should be included in taxable income; and the definition of an investor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We might well have then not only the film and television training school but also a post-graduate school of industrial design, a post-graduate Australian conservatorium, an opera school and, perhaps in the future, a ballet school and a national institute nf dramatic art conferred to the one site, all self-governing, all independent, yet by their <span class="highlight">nature</span> interrelated and the activities of any one perhaps influencing the activities of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this scheme is allowed to be established it may be too late to do anything because of the continuous <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition is concerned that reports of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> are being tabled in the Parliament and no opportunity is being given to debate them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 hope that in the near future the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  and the Government will give serious consideration to making statements when reports of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> are tabled so that honourable members can debate the merits of the reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It must be recognised that any substantia] extension of institutions and procedures for the formal review of administrative action will in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of things add materially both to the time taken in the administrative process and to the costs it entails. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee also considered the publication of Hansard, taking a special interest in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the daily and weekly Hansards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will not only change the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Hansard from that of a reference document to a news item, but should also enable it to be produced somewhat more economically as revenue from sales should offset production costs to a greater extent than at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a sense, its purpose is largely of a welfare <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would hope that it can be made abundantly clear that this scheme is in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of a one year holding operation to allow individuals, industry leaders and the Government a few precious months in which to formulate and apply appropriate courses of action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The open ended <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the scheme could thus not only prove very expensive but is also another strong argument for strict adhesion to its one year operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>la the words of my friend the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, even if it means having something in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of- a means test, means tests are not unknown on the other side of the House either. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On several occasions I have pointed out to the House that because of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the criteria some whom we believed to be in genuine need were excluded from eligibility simply because of the inclusion of a means test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With regard to the detailed application of the policy, a distinction can be made between overseas investment in Australian bank shares of a portfolio <span class="highlight">nature</span> and overseas investment with a view to exercising an influence over an Australian bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But without the scheme I fear for what might happen in some of the areas because the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the soil in these areas is similar to that in the areas which are covered by the Bill we are discussing tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real answer, of course, is of a political <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia has made this contribution which has been of a practical <span class="highlight">nature</span> but once again far too little and far too late. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some of this information, such as from a low trajectory missile, is of such a <span class="highlight">nature</span> that action must be taken within split seconds if there is to be any effective defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Others are of a more long term <span class="highlight">nature</span>, and some, regrettably, will be dependent on the provision of additional resources, both financial and manpower, which may not be readily available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is only the tip of the iceberg; the fact that there were 22 injuries of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> confirms that there was a measure of substance to the allegations, that it is most fortunate that these practices were exposed, and that Judge Rapke conducted his investigation and recommended measures designed to eliminate them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with what the Minister has said about the comprehensive <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the investigation and the dedication of Judge Rapke during the whole course of his investigation into what were at that time and, I believe the Minister would agree, still are very serious allegations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In relation to the First and Second Schedules I detailed at some length the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the changes when I introduced the relevant Tariff Proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would hope that, although it is not in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of an appeal as I read the Bill, it would obviate some of the risk taken in trying to go to the High Court, which as I said before, is a long way away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the questions would be of such a <span class="highlight">nature</span> and likely to recur with such melancholy frequency as to increase beyond suitable bounds the work load of the High Court in its constitutional supervisory role in relation to officers of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To assist widows who are purchasing homes under the scheme and who are in necessitous circumstances there is a relief scheme of a most sympathetic <span class="highlight">nature</span> to reduce the burden of repayments and home maintenance to a level which they can meet even in the lowest ebb of their financial worry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition to the loan funds of $485m allocated to the Home Builders Accounts, additional moneys amounting to approximately $120m have become available for lending due to the revolving <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Accounts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the changes needed, and indeed the necessity of changes at all, may take on a rather different aspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, it is a simple fact that if we cannot provide all those necessities we not only will create unnecessary problems and suffering of an acute <span class="highlight">nature</span> for people already in Australia but also will seriously aggravate the situation as more people come in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On Friday I travelled by helicopter with the State Minister along this coastline - easily the smallest operation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> being conducted in the area is that being conducted by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support that decision because I believe that people who live in places like Sydney, which has a high population density, must have the opportunity to get away from the box-like structures which various developers put up and get into areas of recreation where they can commune with <span class="highlight">nature</span>, fish or do whatever they like to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The power that this Parliament possesses today is utterly inadequate for the responsibilities which are cast upon it and it seems to me to be in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of a massive charade that the Parliament is asked to deal with disputes in this sector of ‘he economy or in this part of the continent when in essence and in truth the Parliament has no power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course the Prime Minister of this country was entitled to believe that if a serious and significant proposal of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> had come from the United States, he would be the first to be informed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The third issue, which is of far greater significance than either of the first 2, concerns the fundamental principles underlying the Government’s policy in relation to the defence of South East Asia and its understanding of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of its responsibilities to the people of South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is fairly clear that even at this late stage that the Opposition does not understand the purpose and <span class="highlight">nature</span> of this piece of legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say that the Opposition does not understand the very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of this legislation for 2 reasons: firstly, because of the amendments that were inserted into the legislation in the Senate and the manner in which those amendments were inserted - the illconcieved <span class="highlight">nature</span> and the poor drafting of some of them; secondly, because of some of the speeches that have been made tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a form of legislation creating a criminal offence which places members of the business community in a situation where, because of the vague <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the proposed offence, which involves a subjective element they do not know whether they have committed an offence until a jury finally has brought in a verdict and they find that perhaps for some years, although they may have been advised to the contrary, they have been committing an offence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point I am coming to is that this indebtedness by local government authorities and semi-government authorities is used on capital works, such as the construction of buildings, the purchase of land for open space, and the provision of drainage, bridges, roads, freeways and other works of a capital <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, one could put it to the Government that, given the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of this problem and the broadness with which it occurs within the community - not in a narrow area related only to the Customs Department - and given the legislative authority which the Federal Government undoubtedly has, one would have expected a comprehensive approach by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think this is a very fair statement and one that indicates to people in these affected areas that they can expect assistance right up to that time but if there have been changed conditions in the meantime of a beneficial <span class="highlight">nature</span> financially, this assistance will be tapered off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In clause 3, which in conjunction with the third column in the table which forms the schedule to the Bill authorises the payments of grants totalling $6.66m to the States in 1971-72, the grant to each State is stated to be ‘for the purpose of financial assistance in connection with expenditure of a capital <span class="highlight">nature</span> on primary schools and secondary schools conducted by that State’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Prices are down to rock bottom for basic things of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a tariff grows, as ours has, through history and by accident, of course you are still running against, you might say, the course of economic <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tariff provides the opportunity for planning and indeed we have altered, as I say, the course of economic <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say this because I do not believe it is possible, having regard to human <span class="highlight">nature</span>, and indeed the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of politics, to change the structure of industry unless you pay attention to these things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Also, peak loadings and matters of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> must be taken into account by the airlines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not previously had any request for assistance of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> in our contact with that Government in respect of aid which, as the House will know, we are giving on a substantial scale at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Labor government would, in co-operation with the States, nominate certain existing country cities and towns as growth areas and authorise the Commonwealth Grants Commission to recommend the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and amount of Commonwealth financial assistance required to remove the problems of servicing these regional centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic problem as I see it is that there is a difference between an established industry in which the resources are established  and  which has an infrastructure built round it - there might be communities, cities  or towns,  and any decision of a major <span class="highlight">nature</span> can affect the whole economic life of that community - and an infant industry, a new industry starring up under the umbrella of protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I can ascertain, the States will have an expenditure of a capital <span class="highlight">nature</span> in this financial year of about $220m on the public sector of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So from the Commonwealth grants, about $165m is going to expenditure of a capital <span class="highlight">nature</span> in the public sector of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is need for us to be more clear, from the financial statements that come before us from time to time, how much of the grants that are made to the States of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the $209m referred to in the Bills that we are debating cognately are spent in different directions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However I believe that from year to year it should be possible to have presented to us in the House information on how the States did spend grants of a capital <span class="highlight">nature</span> in the previous year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In point of fact we are beginning to get schools of a private <span class="highlight">nature</span>, which are not greater public schools, that are actually educationally experimental. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">nature</span> of financial assistance provided by the Commonwealth under the National Health Scheme was fundamentally changed from 1 January, 1952. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-37-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The third point to be determined is the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the sanction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subject to these reservations I would like to think we could work towards a compromise in terms of which we tendered, on behalf of this State, not so much  a  dissenting statement but something more in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of a supplementary statement enlarging on certain aspects of the Report and embracing some of the more recent work we have been doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Association contended that other instruments should not be moved at all because of their delicate <span class="highlight">nature</span>, and mentioned ophthalmic and optical instruments especially. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>quite an unfortunate step to take because at least we are getting the community to come around to the point where it believes that something in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of national superannuation should be introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The accommodation being constructed is of a permanent <span class="highlight">nature</span>, and I would anticipate that in the century to come each place in these aged persons homes would give comfort to many generations of old people, so that even where an initial donation is received, the real impact will be in favour of those who make no donation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A provision of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> is the essential feature of the Bill now before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I take this opportunity of informing the House of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the amendments and of the reasons for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In all three Services there are provisions of an administrative <span class="highlight">nature</span>, for example, requiring certain majorities of the members of a court martial to agree upon it, before imposing a sentence of death. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To that principle we can add the fact that in cases of murder, which is what one normally is talking about in a debate of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>, the overwhelming majority of murders  -  perhaps 95 to 97 per cent - result from domestic problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The accused was not released, of course, because of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the charge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, it is obvious that the Government Parties will need time to look at this Bill and not only to study it in its present context but also to make an examination of the very important matters of a general <span class="highlight">nature</span> that are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But this is a far cry from assuming that things like  Mr Nixon’s  trip to China mean that we are in a new golden age where human <span class="highlight">nature</span> has also taken a great leap forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are talking about something that is of an urgent <span class="highlight">nature</span> which requires the suspension of Standing Orders, what we mean is that, for some reason, new circumstances or some particularly critical factors have emerged which means that a measure which, in this instance, came before the House last session should be brought forward tonight so that we can debate it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, what I want to point out is the way in which question time in this House is being steadily eroded by questions of a frivolous <span class="highlight">nature</span> and questions which waste the time of the House when what we should be doing here is building up the reputation and status of the House to make it the great national forum that it should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps it is not totally convincing but the argument is that in current circumstances and in view of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the job to be done the commissioner will with a small staff be responsible for the whole operation; that it is a small system and it is not appropriate at this stage at least to have a representative commission, in other words, to overload the apple cart and to have a heavy administrative structure to administer something which at the moment is specifically a teaching service operating for a relatively small number of teachers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important thing is that whilst the numbers of teachers and students involved are not as great as are usually involved in a State teaching service, there is greater diversity in <span class="highlight">nature</span> than any other teaching set-up in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view- of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the task involved I think there is justification for more than one commissioner to be in control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All over Australia a concerted attempt has been made to throw off the domination of the Public Service Board, not because of any personal dislike of members of the Board but because it is recognised that the province of responsibility, the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of responsibility or the diversity of responsibility of Public Service Boards - whether they be State boards or, in this case, the Commonwealth Public Service Board - have extended enormously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An educational body, by its very <span class="highlight">nature</span>, requires its own authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this shows a false analysis of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of educational administration, again revealing a Public Service attitude to the whole problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another factor considered was the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the job being done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A pension shall cease to be payable in respect of any period during which the pensioner is absent from Australia, unless the Director-General is satisfied that the absence is of a temporary <span class="highlight">nature</span>, in which case payment may be continued in respect of the period of that absence, but not in any case in respect of a longer period than 30 weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Patterns of relations between countries, and the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of formal international defence arrangements may change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That Act also provided for the appointment of an interim council which was to examine the matter of the establishment of the Institute and to make recommendations with respect to the functions and powers of the Institute, the constitution of its governing council, the site of the seat of the Institute and the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the cooperation with the James Cook University of North Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">nature</span> of that equipment is a matter for discussion and decision by the Council and the Director of the Institute but I am able to say that the Government has accepted, in principle, the need for an approximately 80-foo’ research vessel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A further point of a technical <span class="highlight">nature</span> is the failure to specify adequately the necessity for a mode of service of a direction under new section  12e  to attend a compulsory conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Section  29  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is in virtually identical terms and appears to have caused few problems, but that section is part of a system quite different in scope and <span class="highlight">nature</span> from the quite different procedure introduced by this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, they are all matters that could be defined under the provisions of this Bill as involving a refusal to perform the full range of the employees’ duties should there be any delay to the work in hand because of a stop-work meeting or something of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But disputes of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> are not going to be solved if people like the Premier of Victoria say, while the dispute is on, that they will refer the matter to arbitration and then, when arbitration takes place, say they are not going to take any notice of the decision until later - in this case September. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The legislation is insidious in its <span class="highlight">nature</span> in the precedent it will set and in the industrial electoral manoeuvering which the Government is now commencing for the purpose of this year’s election, lt sets precedents of industrial terminology which are unacceptable to any person in organised labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us indicate to the electors that the matter that has agitated them to the, point of walking the streets and knocking on doors in order to enlist the aid of sympathetic people about their cause is considered to be of such a <span class="highlight">nature</span> in this Parliament that the petitions which they tender will receive consideration by somebody with some authority in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the matter is of a major <span class="highlight">nature</span>, as is the proposal submitted by the honourable member for Corio, I think that the Standing Orders Committee should consider the matter carefully before it is presented to this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr SCHOLES (Corio) - I seek leave to reply in view of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they do, we will overcome the difficulty that arises because of the time-absorbing <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the procedures for the presentation of petitions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless we can achieve a practice of adopting decent attitudes and procedures and having respect for members in the very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of debate, there is no doubt that we will have little chance of getting the reformation of the Standing Orders that we need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I recall the figures, the productivity increase during the year  1970-71  compared with the previous year was only  1.4  per cent and that, of course, is an appalling level of productivity growth, having regard to the essential <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the inflationary spiral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the fact that overseas firms and agents can buy equity interests in Australian companies, thereby acquiring not only profits but also some influence on the operations of such companies, will the Prime Minister consider the implementation of policies designed to broaden the scope and <span class="highlight">nature</span> of overseas investments by Australian residents to allow them to acquire equity interests in overseas companies, particularly those operating in Australia but not listed on Australian stock exchanges? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This has been attacked by the honourable member for Riverina, but I do not think that the attack can be given much credence for obviously it is a most responsible action on the part of the Government to review a scheme of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>, to see how it is working and, if there are certain problems or actions that should be taken, not to wait too long to correct them, or reorganise or re-aim - if I may use that word - the objects of the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am quite sure, after the deplorable performance of Government supporters this afternoon in spending 2 hours discussing an off-chance statement by a paid officer of the New South Wales Branch pf the Australian Labor Party, that if any honourable member on this side of the House had been engaged in anything of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>, the Government would still be talking about it, if one took as a classic example its performance in this place last week in relation to Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>And yet, as I have said, at the very same time Lord Casey was confiding to his diary and, one must assume to Prime Minister Menzies at least, his real view about the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Viet Minh and the impossibility of a military solution in Indo-China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the Acting Postmaster-General did indicate publicly what the decision of Cabinet was, that additional power to control Sunday morning telecasting could be given to the Board so that telecasts at that time would conform to a standard developed by the Board, namely that Sunday morning might be given to the particular considerations of minority interests or groups within the community, to religious services and items of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Changes proposed by the Government, which I will shortly outline in more detail, affect principally the base period provisions, the range of items eligible for grant, the treatment of salaries and wages of employees engaged for part of the year on industrial research and development, the treatment of plant expenditure, and conditions governing eligibility of companies for grants, as well as a number of amendments of an administrative <span class="highlight">nature</span> designed to strengthen and clarify certain areas of the Act’s operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I consider that amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and to other Acts of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> probably are some of the most important issues dealt with by any Australian parliament because throughout Australia, not only the parliaments but also, I believe, the people believe in the system of conciliation and arbitration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Holgate, because of  the sensitive <span class="highlight">nature</span>  of  commentary on election matters at this time, is not actively associated with the day to day running  of  T.D.T., but is working on general matters answerable to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has become increasingly apparent that to give full effect to this policy the independent schools need assurances for the future, including assistance of a capital <span class="highlight">nature</span> as well as continuing help with running costs on a basis that will take positive account of cost increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sorry that I have to stand here during the Committee stage of the Bill,  Mr Deputy Chairman,  and endeavour to point this out to the Government and to a Minister who thinks nothing of grabbing almost $40,000 a year of the taxpayers’ money and who wants to force through a Bill of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> the purpose of which is to deny a proper and just salary to the majority members of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that I had double standards because I support an increase in the wages of those on the minimum wage and those who are generally in receipt of an award wage, but I do not necessarily support an increase of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> proposed by this clause and I do not support the proposition that the income of medical practitioners should be increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very <span class="highlight">nature</span> and the effects of the amendments contained in the Bill make it patently clear that either the Government has no knowledge or appreciation of what is required to improve employer and union relationships or it has deliberately set a course that not only will further aggravate the existing position but also will bring about a situation in which it will be well nigh impossible for unions and employers working in concert to prevent minor issues from becoming major stoppages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also indicate to honourable members that in the course of the Committee stage of this Bill I shall be moving certain amendments, most of which, I think it is fair to say, are of a technical <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Action of any general kind to restrain or reduce the growth of foreign ownership and control will carry implications in a number of fields - introduction of technical know-how, for example - which stem from the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of direct investment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Equally, action to reduce the potential for domestic economic management conflict situations to arise might not, depending on its precise <span class="highlight">nature</span>, have any effects upon foreign ownership and control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The only body likely to object to an agreement of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> is the Commonwealth Government and if the Government does seek to set aside an agreement which simply gives effect to an agreement reached between the parties as to techniques and operating procedures inside a factory, the Government ought to go out on its head. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If a mistake of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> is made in the national wage case, the Government is not dealing with an increase of 20c a week for the person on $70 a week; it is dealing with his ability to maintain his standard of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To quote a phrase of some economists, the tertiary services are by <span class="highlight">nature</span> ‘unprogressive’, in the sense that their performance in productivity growth seems generally to be low by comparison with manufacturing (measurement is difficult). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When an application for a bans clause comes before a presidential member of the Commission the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the hearing is such that every opportunity will be given to the parties to resolve their differences and avoid the making of a bans clause if they are prepared to act with good will and in the best interests of their members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has, however, been strongly put that in many cases it is difficult to ascertain the facts which will lead to action of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> within a period of 6 months, perhaps because of some fraud en the part of the persons in control of the election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I do not canvass the issues involved, and the extent to which that question will involve the current legislation obviously will be determined by the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the judgment which is handed down by the court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Minister’s announcement today will reassure him as to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and extent of Australia’s increasing interest in his country, which in so many political, economic and social matters has been the forerunner for developments in our region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Contrast this with a land based system in which the cost and the complexity grow according to the distance covered and of course are extremely dependent on the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and accessibility of the intervening terrain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again I ask the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden)  to consider making an appropriate amendment to section 72 of the Income Tax Assessment Act so that specific provision of the law will allow these outgoings of a private and domestic <span class="highlight">nature</span> to become deductible for income tax purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the meantime many people have died and many more have suffered serious ill health, mostly of a chronic <span class="highlight">nature</span>, as a result of the effects of cigarette and tobacco smoking in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No doubt if one were to look closely at the Government ranks one would find quite a lot of members holding pecuniary interests of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> and it would be to their benefit to see cigarette advertising going to radio and television companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Inevitably when people who are in that situation arrive in the new country and find that it does not fit in with the stereotype picture that they had of it they are inclined - perhaps understandably, as this is human <span class="highlight">nature</span> - to suggest that they have been misled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor movement and, indeed, the people in Australia were well aware that Australia was a country favoured bv <span class="highlight">nature</span> and circumstances, lt became the ideal of the Australian people to establish in Australia a standard that was not to be determined solely or mainly by economic or social conditions in the old world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The length and complexity  of  the drafting is due essentially to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of general insurance business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-38-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is essential, therefore, that we preserve the great gifts <span class="highlight">nature</span> has given us and that we keep our environment as free from man-made contamination as human skills can devise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because the environment is such a complex interaction of man, <span class="highlight">nature</span>, technology and society we cannot just set up a bureaucracy and call it the Department of the Environment and expect it to solve our problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The arrival in Australia of such large numbers in the last 10 years particularly, has, however, strained almost every aspect of the <span class="highlight">Nature</span>-Man-Technology-Society System. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To keep our lives human and preserve at least some of <span class="highlight">nature</span> at all we must reaffirm our control of technology and end our mindless slavery to it and worship of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The term ‘privileges’ is commonly used to describe the concessions, often of a fiscal <span class="highlight">nature</span>, which countries traditionally accord to foreign consular posts and their staffs, while the term ‘immunities’ describes the jurisdictional immunities which international law confers on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In reporting favourably on the proposal the Committee recommended: If tests and evaluations justify the use of carpets as an economic floor covering and if there is no doubt about its suitability, it should be used in single cabins at HMAS ‘Stirling; service scales and standards of accommodation should be amended to provide carpet as a floor covering in single cabins; the advice of experts on environmental problems should continue to be sought and implemented during development and occupation of the naval support facility; because of the widespread <span class="highlight">nature</span> of community interest, day to day care and management of areas of Garden Island open to the public should be a State responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this Parliament is to delegate serious work to a committee which can examine all the evidence on the matter and bring down a useful and reliable report, we must ensure in the future that the Prime Minister, the Minister for the Navy and every other parliamentarian come to understand the independent <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the work to be undertaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Erosion is one of the main reasons why anyone plants trees in an orderly fashion, rather than allow <span class="highlight">nature</span> to run wild and create problems with black spear grass, of which the honourable member spoke, wild rushes and everything else that makes so much of our forest areas unattractive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Melbourne on 7th September 1971,  Dr R.  F.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The implication of this provision is that, for amounts of eligible research and development expenditure of less than $50,000, the achievement of these objectives is not important because, irrespective of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the subject of research a general grant will be awarded where there is an increase in research and development expenditures, and other conditions are fulfilled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Members of the Public Service still rely on their industrial organisations, to put their case, but immediately those Public Service organisations attempt to do something of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> in order to gain a percentage increase, as was instanced by the honourable member for Grayndler a number of Ministers go clamouring to the Press making all sorts of statements that there must not be a flow-on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The archival classification given to records of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> requires the holding for 2 years only and therefore it is possible to give accurate details only in respect of 1970-71 and 1971-72. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-42-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commissioner, who was asked to comment, has confirmed that, under the present law, your request is one for consideration under a general provision which authorises a deduction for expenditure incurred in gaining or producing assessable income or necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving such income, except to the extent to which it is of a capital, private or domestic <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As there is nothing in the Budget about this subject and this Bill covers only a couple of works of art and things of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>, it certainly has not received favourable consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although various considerations concerning the particular scheme advanced by this survey (and the inevitably ‘leading’ <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the question asked) prevent direct comparison with our study, there are at least two  common  findings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that hitherto it has been the policy of the Australian Government to discourage the investment of Australian funds overseas - for example, in neighbouring countries - for the cogent reason that we have been, in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of things, a capital importing country and have been chronically short of foreign reserves? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am glad that has been admitted and recognised because there is a great deal of doubt and uncertainty in industry not only about the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the new scheme and whether it will represent any advance on the old one, which has had some successes, but because it has operated long enough to reveal its very serious deficiencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the Government should  b2  congratulated because until 1954, when this Government was in power, nothing of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> had been done for old people in Australia, It was this Government which initiated the idea of homes for the aged, and this has been a magnificent scheme which has been implemented throughout the length and breadth of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Credit unions, because of their very self help <span class="highlight">nature</span>  -  I wish on this occasion the member for Melbourne Ports  (Mr Crean)  were in the House - are stable and efficient members of the Australian financial community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is suitably acknowledged, but the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Minister’s advice is that the scheme is not practical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Shortly after the Minister for the Environment made  a  statement in this House relating to impact statements, I caused a letter to  be  sent to each of  my  ministerial colleagues, over the signature of the permanent head of my Department, giving instructions that whenever the problem of environment or pollution was involved in any submission to Cabinet there must be interdepartmental consideration and the results of that interdepartmental consideration must be mentioned in the Cabinet submission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The negotiation of immense loans of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> in these troubled times of growing general unemployment and threatened unemployment in the aircraft industry in a manner which does nothing to alleviate that unemployment in any sector of the community indicates that this Government’s priorities are completely out of touch with the needs of the community, particularly when the loan is being negotiated long prior to its actual date of requirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In its day to day operations there is not much evidence which should lead us to want a more socialised scheme ultimately depending upon a very centralised and bureaucratic organisation, thereby tending by its <span class="highlight">nature</span> to diminish the private relationship between a doctor and his patient which necessarily underlies the operation of any medical practice in any nation in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It became very clear to me that if mankind wishes to live in a world which is reasonably free from pollution and if it wishes to preserve for future generations a world of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>, most of the governments in the world will have to take very drastic action and take it promptly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This definition of the railway role arises from the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the railway cost structure, in which over 60 per cent of total costs relate to items which do not vary in the short term in accordance with fluctuations in the volume of traffic, and ensures that additional traffic can be handled on specific routes at a less than proportionate increase in total costs.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact of the matter is that if the Prime Minister had not tried to conceal the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the transaction, if he had not been so touchy on any question about his infallibility or bis phenomenal memory, if he had given a straightforward account with the appropriate apologies that the right honourable member for Higgins  (Mr Gorton)  gave last Thursday, the whole matter could have been cleared up quickly and cleanly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been a systematic pattern of delay and evasion designed to hide 2 aspects of the transaction: First, the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the decision to send aid to Cambodia, and second, the internal controversy between departments over the failure to observe proper procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not have any ulterior motive of giving favour to anyone; rather do 1 seek that the Prime Minister, other members of the Cabinet and those other honourable members who are situated in offices on the far side of Parliament House be given an equal opportunity to participate in debates and divisions without running the risk of having heart attacks, falls or anything of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> on their way to this august place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have tried to assess its role, its very reason for being; its effectiveness; whether its scope should be enlarged or diminished, and, if so, whether it should be restructured into more or less tiers or replaced by statutory authorities and ad hoc bodies; how it should be financed; and, above all, given its very delegated <span class="highlight">nature</span>, whether it is or is capable of meeting the needs of the communities it seeks to serve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner I had traversed the traditional pleasantries and pointed out that the theme of my speech was the need for economic planning of a long term <span class="highlight">nature</span> in order to build up our national cake so that we can get on with that job to which all of us in the Labor Party are so committed, namely, allocating fairer shares and making sure that there is a more just society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have seen changes in some of the most basic assumptions of previous governments and we will have to try to understand the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of these changes if we are to be able reasonably to evaluate the new Government’s legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps the Government has realised that joint control in an installation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> is both dangerous and meaningless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>We believe that the Government has already committed itself to unprecedented levels of expenditure and should examine programs of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> with a greater degree of responsibility than that which it has been prepared to show so far. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the Government’s substantial financial commitments, its obvious difficulty in meeting the cost of its election proposals and the inflationary pressures which it has generated, it is inconceivable that it should now initiate procedures which by their very <span class="highlight">nature</span> will entail wastage of public funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I conclude by referring to the matters raised by the honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman)  which I believe was a relevant matter to raise in a debate of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This inquiry was very important because it demonstrated the completely arbitrary <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the pricing policies of companies such as BHP. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the explanation derives from 2 things - firstly, from the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Australian Labor Party machine and its control over the Government and, secondly, from weakness of character in the 2 gentlemen whom I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Given the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of defence heirarchies and the implications of Nixon’s Guam Doctrine, it seems to me that we should also review our procedure for the collection and assessment of intelligence so that it assumes a more relevant aspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Defence is too important to be left entirely to defence personnel and decision makers, who by the very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of defence planning must be less informed than they should. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Public Service Board has indicated that subject to the passage of this Bill, it proposes to amend the existing Public Service Regulations so that an additional week’s leave can be extended to temporary employees under the Public Service Act and to officers and employees who, because of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> or location . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was so held by the whole court having regard to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and function of section 41 that the term ‘adult person’ in that section should not be accorded a vague and imprecise meaning such as ‘mature person’ but should be construed as a term of fixed connotation bearing the ordinary meaning - it possessed both at law and in common usage - that is, a person at the full age of 21 years as used in contradistinction to an infant at law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly they did not have persuasion to the Court and on reading the judgment this is understandable because the Court was concerned with the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and function of section 41 of the Constitution and how the term ‘adult person’ in that section should be accorded and that it should not be, in their terms, accorded a vague and imprecise meaning such as mature person’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It means simply that there is a sheer need for information about the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of government, the structure of government in this country and, I would add, the main philosophies of the contending political parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the Government’s announcement that tertiary fees are to be abolished as from the 1974 academic year, I do not envisage that the need for assistance of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> will be as great in the remaining years of the 1973- 75 triennium and, for that reason the Government decided that grants should be made in the 1973 academic year only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They remove the very unfortunate speculative <span class="highlight">nature</span> of divorce proceedings whereby an order for costs meant that if a petitioner went to a lawyer, the lawyer would act only when he was reasonably sure that he would get his costs out of someone else’s hide over a long period of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think anybody can underestimate the difficulties, the confusions and the contradictions which must in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of things occur in this program, but I think that this simple program is the right program for those Aboriginals who are in the south or nearer to our way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government also hopes to provide work of such a <span class="highlight">nature</span> as to provide job training and responsibility, which should make a positive approach in this sphere as the finance allocated for this special project work has been directed to the areas where the problem of Aboriginal employment is most acute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would suggest that, when any Minister undertakes a tour of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> - it could be a visit by the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor),  the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs or any other Minister - it is quite competent and should be the order of the day for one ot two members of the Opposition and of the Government who are particularly interested in those matters that the Minister is going to see to travel with the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A tremendous amount of ceremonial life is local and should not be the object of open study in an Aboriginal community, because from the Aboriginal point of view the efficacy or the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the ceremony depends upon the details of that ceremony being restricted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Councils in my area, particularly the City of Greater Cessnock Council, feel that if the money is allocated to obtain more capital equipment such as bulldozers and materials used in more effective projects such as sewerage works, road building and the construction of bridges it would be of more benefit to the people in the shires because it is work of a permanent <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that the type of work in which some of the former unemployed were engaged, such as removing weeds and grass, had a somewhat demoralising effect because those engaged in it felt that they were not doing a constructive job of a permanent <span class="highlight">nature</span> and from which all the community would benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A committee which seeks to examine price levels in the private sector without having regard to the inflationary impact on the economy of the public sector will not have the capacity to examine the overall <span class="highlight">nature</span> of Australia’s inflationary experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the Government is seeking to establish a series of organisations and procedures designed to examine prices rather than the overall <span class="highlight">nature</span> of our inflation problem, is evidence of the traditional outdated thinking within the Australian Labor Party that the problem of inflation can best be met by the control or restraint of prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee could see no objection, as the honourable member for Bradfield indicated, to the transmission of very important debates, such as those on the budget, economic or foreign affairs or question time and matters of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Previous speakers have referred to the almost inescapable requirement to change 2 essential things - the venue, which is of course the very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of this chamber and undoubtedly the chamber of the other place, and the procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many differences such as the very layout of the chamber, the very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the way in which the business proceeds and the fact that at question time there is a series of questions on notice as distinct from our own pattern of procedure of questions without notice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me say also that in some respects the Australian people have not fully appreciated the extent and the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the changes in foreign policy which the Labor Government in office has been introducing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition’s objectives in disallowing the Public Service Arbitrator’s determinations were, firstly, to make it clear to the Australian public that an election promise made by the Australian Labor Party was being dishonoured on its election to government and, secondly, to object to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the policy which the Government sought to implement - a policy which was discriminatory, unfair and lacking in merit and substance; a policy which in application would have created a division in the Commonwealth Public Service which was contrary to the interests of this country; a policy which sought to create a group of second-class and under-privileged citizens within the Public Service; and a policy which sought to implement union demands for compulsory unionism within the Commonwealth Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You,  Mr Speaker,  would recognise the very serious <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the decision, taken in a sense by stealth, to seek to reach a contrived position without the opportunity for a full and open parliamentary debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unlike the Government we believe that industrial benefits of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> ought not to be selectively applied to various sections of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any government introducing a Bill of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> ought to have an accurate assessment of its consequent costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite a practical sort of chap and I know that it is quite impossible to lay down in actual figures what the costs will be of any measure of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> because such a yardstick cannot be described exactly in figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that in a measure of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> where so much is involved there will be a cost to the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Parliament, which is a responsible body, should look very thoroughly at this situation when a Bill of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> is brought in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The point I made at the beginning was that I was disturbed by the fact that the second reading speech did not fully explain the consequences of any major move of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I trust that in future when the Government brings down legislation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> involving so many people it will make available to honourable members a document setting out what is involved in the measure and provide far more information than has been supplied on this occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An important thing which this legislation is designed to ensure is the representative <span class="highlight">nature</span> of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It provides for a 20 per cent tolerance which remains the ideal tolerance level suited to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and direction of Australia’s population development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before him was  Sir Arthur  Fadden - earthy, capable and a shrewd judge of human <span class="highlight">nature</span>, with qualities of fairness and friendliness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it follows in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of things that we all tend to look at them from our individual political point of view because, as I said, our own future is tied up with such legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the people being affected are, in many instances, patients who have been in nursing homes receiving long term care - patients who, whether of a light nursing care <span class="highlight">nature</span> or of an intensive care <span class="highlight">nature</span>, have come to regard the nursing homes where they are being properly accommodated as their homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report makes it quite clear, as I have already pointed out in my letter to  Mr Byrne,  that the viability of smaller ports like Portland will not, in the end, be judged by the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the levying arrangements for the guaranteed minimum wage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The political <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the second reading speech of the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  - the Minister responsible for electoral matters - is, I think, without precedent in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we look at section 19 of the existing Act and the changes which the Labor Party wants to initiate in that area we find the really insidious <span class="highlight">nature</span> of its proposals which would have a dramatic and unfortunate impact upon representation in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime, the Government wishes to ensure that additional capital projects of an urgent <span class="highlight">nature</span> are not delayed until after that date, and this Bill to provide supplementary grants totalling $10m is an interim measure intended to raise the level of assistance available under the existing arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For those reasons - the method by which the Prime Minister did it, the undertaking he gave to me and the very serious <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the matter - it is required to be subjected to examination by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All work by its very <span class="highlight">nature</span> is hazardous because it takes a man away from the things he would wish to do or the things he would probably normally do, and in order to satisfy the economic needs of his family he engages in activities that are not necessarily familiar to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I may elaborate, for the benefit of the honourable member, I anticipated a question of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> today because when the Liberal-Country Party Government in New South Wales is perpetuating one of the greatest gerrymanders of all time I think it appropriate that the nation should know about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My reason at that time which still remains valid, and the acceptance of this proposition negates much of what the honourable member for Mackellar has said tonight, was that both these propositions - that is, firstly, that we should not have a different eligibility period outside Australia and within it and, secondly, that it is not our concern to have reciprocity before we advance - depend in the last resort on our concept of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the pension system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If employees at a particular factory decided to knock off work to listen to the Minister for Labour and decided to remain off work until they felt tired of listening to what the Minister for Labour was saying, it would mean that they would have the whole day off, in which event the employer would be able to satisfy me court that his conduct that was the subject of the charge was reasonably justified by reason of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the behaviour of the  employee  concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One other important aspect of this Bill which has never been provided for in any other Bills of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> and which makes a significant advance, is that the States through their housing authorities may provide to local government areas bridging finance so that community facilities can be provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the more complex <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the DFRB benefits structure, however, the Commonwealth share of each pension cannot be calculated without considerable difficulty and, if this were to be done, there would be a further long and unacceptable delay in the actual payment of the pension increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But what I do want to stress is that, on tha costs side of the equation, the Government not only is doing nothing but is positively reversing the course we have been on whereby the Full Bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission could have become something in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of a pay board - a board of review of inflationary wage settlements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me indicate briefly the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the factors and trends to which I have just referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The feasible rate of expansion would depend essentially on the size and <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the base force - the core force - and the resources the nation would be able to put into the development of this force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But there is nothing more annoying or distracting than when in the middle of hearing a witness in a committee a quorum of one of the Houses of Parliament is called or there is a division or something of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Back in the days of Burley Griffin, early in the design of Canberra, a national symbol and the Parliament were thought of as one and the same whereas, I think, if we look at Burley Griffin’s reports, we will see that he spoke of having a national symbol on Capital Hill and the Parliament on Camp Hill, or something of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the role of the ‘Parliament in Government in Australia demands that it be housed in a structure of pre-eminence in the National Capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It provides a general description of tourism in Australia by looking at the following questions: What is the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and degree of our appeal as a tourist destination? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of its problems are due both to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the industry and to shorter-term adverse circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am speaking of such things as the Commonwealth Aid Roads Agreement - a new agreement will be entered into next year; the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement which has been successfully negotiated by my colleague the Minister for Housing  (Mr Les Johnson);  our proposed subsidy for urban public transport that the Minister for Transport and Minister for Civil Aviation  (Mr Charles Jones)  has also negotiated; our sewerage program; our policies on land commissions; assistance for the National Estate - in co-operation with State governments, local government, the private sector, private companies and private individuals, we want to preserve what has been created by man and by <span class="highlight">nature</span>; and, of course, our new cities program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am not underestimating the difficulty of the task before us or the expensive <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the undertakings we have made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that Canberra is a clear indication of the success which can be achieved by the use of a planning body similar in <span class="highlight">nature</span> to the NCDC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turning to the details of the Bill, the first 5 clauses are of a machinery <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remaining clauses are mainly of a machinery <span class="highlight">nature</span> and are similar to those contained in the existing legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The existing legislation provides for a 20 per cent tolerance in the quota which remains the ideal level suited to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and direction of Australia’s population development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These figures illustrate that the Distribution Commissioners approach their task with objectivity, and use the  20  per cent provision only when that is necessary because of the special <span class="highlight">nature</span> of particular electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nonetheless, I concur with the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  and the Minister for Education  (Mr Beazley)  that it is appropriate that we recognise the significance of an occasion when we transfer our allegiance from a monarch who is essentially British by name and <span class="highlight">nature</span> to one who is Australian by identity and by approval of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government will not reconsider this decision because of its sudden death <span class="highlight">nature</span>, it should do one of 3 things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government should forget about the proposal, postpone it for 12 months, bring in a double rate of sales tax so that the incentive is still there to use fruit juice or phase it out over 3 years and give the industry a reasonable time in which to adjust instead of having the sudden death <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (2) The former Attorney-General,  Senator Greenwood,  has said that he has retained certain official documents which I understand to be  of  a confidential <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-73-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not aware that any other former Ministers in recent years have retained official documents of a confidential <span class="highlight">nature</span> which were made available to them in their former official capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-73-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The group’s task was to examine the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and extent of resources available and in the light of its findings to make recommendations for the implementation and development of a program involving teaching in Aboriginal languages and the incorporation in the school curriculum of further elements of traditional Aboriginal arts, crafts and skills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-73-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition, where proposals are sought from overseas manufacturers for the supply of equipment, it is made clear that the degree and <span class="highlight">nature</span> of participation by Australian industry offered will be an important factor in the process of evaluating offers received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-73-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless, they have transformed the essential character of the industry and have posed some very pertinent questions relating to its general <span class="highlight">nature</span> and to the specific provisions of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a continual requirement for Government policy to be responsive to the changing <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the rural economy and one of the most rapidly and fundamentally changing areas is in the wine and grape growing industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I call on the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  in the course of this debate to outline the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the current examinations of the export incentives scheme which one would hope this Government has under active consideration, the extent of the consultation taking place between the major departments involved and the extent to which the Government proposes to consult and to involve itself in a meaningful dialogue with the principal parties concerned in the Bills before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It would be reasonable in these new circumstances for the Government to make available to the Opposition parties a draft legislative program detailing the business of the House and the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the proposed legislation for a period of, say, 6 weeks ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time the Government either is not prepared or is not able to indicate to the Opposition parties the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of any legislation or in fact even an outline of the parliamentary program more than a few days in advance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I personally believe that because of the democratic <span class="highlight">nature</span> of my Party that objection could be well and truly met on this side of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite the obviously complex <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Budget influence on the economy, Sheehan has argued that the ratio of the Budget deficit to total Budget receipts is a satisfactory indicator of the Budget impact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australian domestic air services are basically of a short haul <span class="highlight">nature</span> and a large part of the time is occupied in providing meals, refreshments, making public announcements and drawing attention to features of the terrain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-47-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The real <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the policy changes initiated by the Postmaster-General is, indeed, disturbing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Inflation, by its <span class="highlight">nature</span> strikes different individuals and groups with highly discriminatory effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an extraordinary exercise in dialectics to include a statement of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> in a Budget which seeks approval for an 18.9 per cent increase in Government expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The excessive <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Government’s expenditure has no better illustration than the fact that, in spite of a  25  per cent increase in personal taxation revenue, the Government has now seen fit to introduce a wide-ranging series of indirect taxation measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the greatest inadequacy of the speeches not only of the Leader of the Opposition but of nearly all the honourable members that I have heard on the other side of the House has been the lack of recognition of the divided <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the country the Government of which they so reluctantly handed over on 2 December 1972; the divisions in the community, the divisions among citizens, the education gap which exists - not the generation gap but the education gap. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then where would be the equity of the person who has struggled all his life to set up a first class firm of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The last of the 3 reports that I have tabled, the report on the 54th series, covers 15 minor items of a mainly technical <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Two days ago the Minister for Urban and Regional Development and I attended at Shackleton Hill in Canberra where an issue of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> presents itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be for the Interim Committee to recommend the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and level of support for recurrent expenditure - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Committee members were impressed by the concentrated <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the difficulties faced by many schools, and their need for supplementary resources, both physical and human. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But now, as far as I can see, the cost of silos, hay sheds and things of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> will be depreciated at the rate of 3 per cent which means there will be approximately a 33-year period for write-off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a socialist Budget, and there is not the slightest doubt that further Budgets brought down by this Government will be increasingly socialist and interventionist in <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That sort of approach, given the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of this Government, would be the ultimate political result of unchecked inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is rather interesting to note that the amendment is such a mess of nonsense and contradictory terms that the majority of honourable members on both sides of this House have concentrated on the Budget, as well they might because of the trivial <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was only in 1957 - a matter of 16 years ago - that the last person was banged in Australia, yet since that date the incidence of crimes of a heinous <span class="highlight">nature</span> and the threats of further crimes have not lessened; they have extended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are not judging on individual cases; we are setting the parameters within which others more competent than we - others who have the facts set out before them - might consider and determine in the circumstances which are there to be judged the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the penalty that should be enforced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that there is a very real problem in our society which relates not only to the Bill that is before us and the enforcement of the death penalty but also to the enforcement of the law itself, the respect for the law, the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of our penal institutions and the way by which, in a society where licentiousness generally is extending, there can be bred in the hearts and minds of the citizens of this world - not just of Australia - a respect for the rule of law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All of us are aware that there have developed patterns which we would see as almost unique in our time and if there is a greater condemnation of our society, perhaps it lies in the peculiar <span class="highlight">nature</span> of some of the perverted crimes that exist in our world today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For that reason, I believe that the concept as advanced is good, but there does need to be a recognition that, firstly, there exists a problem in ensuring that standards apply equally to products which are imported as to those which are produced domestically and, secondly, that we need to consider the diverse <span class="highlight">nature</span> of consumers and the diverse character of persons who are affected by applying consumer standards and ensure that the members of the Commission represent as broad a cross section of the community as is possible to ensure that everyone is taken into account before the standards themselves  aTe  prescribed and before decisions are taken which may react adversely against those who are, after all, the generators of wealth in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, I think that there are many areas of our penal law which need to be revised, the existing penalties reconsidered and the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of their enforcement reconsidered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it should be considered in 3 areas, the first of which is the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of crime itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the deterrent area the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of capital punishment should not be lost sight of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Burglars might do it, other types of convicted criminals might do it, but murderers hardly ever resort to violence because of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the crime -  and those who become useful citizens are common. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">nature</span> of violence, the incidence of violence and the increasing numbers of persons who incite persons to violence are such that there is validity in the retention of capital punishment in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The incidence of bomb attacks in London in the last few weeks, the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the concern at the presence of Arab terrorists in Australia today, the likelihood of action by terrorists tomorrow, whatever their national origin, make up the reason for moving this motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The RSL was not the only organisation which believed that it should be abolished, that it was discriminatory in <span class="highlight">nature</span> and that it had been introduced by the previous Government to provide an increase in pension for a very small percentage of those who received the general rate of pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me take the position a little further: The commission may recommend the establishment of a corporation and also that that corporation follow the practice adopted in the United Kingdom, that as an independent body it must return something in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the bond rate on capital invested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All complaints of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> which have been made to my office and which have been investigated - as far as I am aware, anyway - have not in fact been verified; that is, the doctors have been providing free treatment or in many cases in fact have not withdrawn from the pensioner medical service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All that the employer has to say is that the employee was doing something unlawful and that whatever he, the employer, did - whether it was dismissal or discipline in any way at all - could reasonably be justified by reason of the unlawful <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the act or thing that the person against whom he took the action was doing at the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A factor that would tend to lend greater credibility to the Minister’s claims that this Bill has the fundamental objective of improving the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of industrial relations in Australia would be some mention by him of the committee of inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Owing to the fragmented <span class="highlight">nature</span> of our health and welfare facilities, people needing assistance are often unable to locate the source and they wander through a bureaucratic maze of government, semigovernment and voluntary agencies, becoming more and more distressed as they fail to overcome their emotional or financial problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I mentioned a moment ago, it is too much to expect the Government to accept a motion of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> in thelast 20 minutes of the sitting, particularly if the motion is in relation to the tabling of a paper which the person seeking to table it would not let me read before he asked whether he could table it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So frequently when honourable members of the Opposition have pointed to the fact that the Budget by its very <span class="highlight">nature</span> has contributed to inflation Government supporters have said: ‘Tell us what you would save money on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Given the commercial <span class="highlight">nature</span> of this activity, the financial assistance to be provided for this purpose will comprise a grant of $1Om and a repayable advance - the exact terms of which have yet to be determined - which is currently estimated at $5m but could vary depending upon the level of and trends in deposits and advances, etc., when final settlement occurs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The references which the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)  made about the Minister in this regard, whether it be shipbuilding or any other aspect of his portfolio, definitely do not line up with the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the man as I and many other members who have worked with him know him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Over a longer term I am in favour of the raising of the real wage and not only decreasing hours of work but - I think this is even more important - also using the increased leisure time coupled together in the form of extra holidays, long week-ends or something of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> and not dissipated simply in a few minutes off in each day of work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am also disturbed at the complete disregard shown by honourable members opposite for the recommendations of the Interim Schools Committee in the Karmel Report, which is well known to them and which surely they must have examined, lt outlines the structure and functions of the Schools Commission, which is the very reverse of centralisation of the educational process, lt is couched in terms that allow examination of a wide variety of problems in the educational field of a structural <span class="highlight">nature</span> and an educational <span class="highlight">nature</span> and also the exciting prospects of future change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the setting up of the Schools Commission, such as is proposed by the Minister, will allow us to provide sufficient resources of both a human and material <span class="highlight">nature</span> to give the educational experience appropriate to the society of today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I congratulate the Minister for Education on the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Bill that he has brought forward to form the Australian Schools Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government inherited certain educational structures but this year, under the guidance of the present Minister for Education, we have had measures aimed at assistance in the education of isolated children, and a very high proportion of those children, by the very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of things, attend Catholic schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we are concerned to see that the representative <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the membership of the commission is specified in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 4 is the clause which determines the composition and <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Schools Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the case of agriculture and for many industrial commodities of a traditional <span class="highlight">nature</span>, I pointed to the difficulty for all countries of making further progress in liberalising trade unless a much more realistic approach, indeed a much more humane approach, was taken to the social and political, as well as the economic, problems arising from the adjustment processes brought into play by the freeing of trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We feel that because of the representative <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Schools Commission, as envisaged in our amendment, it is unnecessary for the functions of the Commission to be duplicated by a State board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, we believe that the clause, as it is outlined in the Bill, does not guarantee any really representative <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The whole of that paragraph indicates the general <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the boards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I add these words of support and assure the Minister that we are profoundly interested, as he is, in supporting legislation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If that is not carnage of the worst possible <span class="highlight">nature</span>, I do not know what is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the legislation covers an area of concern, not only to parliamentarians, but also to people whereever they are in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During question time the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  made a friendly interjection which was, of course, of a sarcastic <span class="highlight">nature</span>, to say that I had surrendered in regard to the matter of the statistics then before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Discussions of this kind have been informal, and it has been the responsibility of the Secretary of the Department to decide on the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the advice given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was nothing of a constructive <span class="highlight">nature</span> that they wanted to offer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not want to delay the Committee for very long, but I do want to say, having listened to the right honourable member for Lowe  (Mr McMahon),  that I think he has failed to understand the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have asked the same questions as the right honourable member for Lowe and received privately answers which satisfied me that because it would be in the private sector, those sections of the AIDC which are operating in the private sector should be in every <span class="highlight">nature</span> private, which means that eminent firms of chartered accountants - I do not see why we should not mention the firm in this case; it is the firm well known throughout Australia of Edwin V.

    <p>The very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the type of programs the Corporation seeks to establish requires the amassing of massive actuarial reserves to meet liability under contracts stretching many years ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me that the Australian people have already clearly indicated that whilst they are happy and satisfied with the general private enterprise <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the economy, they want to see a properly constituted public authority express a little more power and a little more competitive influence in this situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And the serious implications of this are that we are being asked to create a powerful central planning authority with extremely wide terms of reference - far wider than those of the Tariff Board - and a body which will, by the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of its genesis in the national Parliament and the deference with which it will inevitably be treated by the Government, exercise an influence of such power as should not be vested in any organisation outside the Government itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When analysed in the calmer atmosphere that should prevail in a department such as that headed by the Minister, we should, if we find there are risks of an environmental <span class="highlight">nature</span> which cause us to question politically made decisions, be strong enough to be outspoken and to have those decisions changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The degree to which the Treasurer may seek to blame overseas pressures can only denote the ineffectual <span class="highlight">nature</span> of his own policies since, as interest rates continue to ease overseas, in Australia they continue to rise indicating that in the development of corrective policies Australia is lagging behind the world’s developed nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Karmel Committee identified a need for more general practitioners, yet I think it ignored the advice of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners which, because of the better community orientation of the Wollongong hospital and the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the proposed curriculum, supported the Wollongong submission over that of Newcastle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One real step forward in the creation of such a system would be the democratisation of the election procedures of these Houses, as the undemocratic <span class="highlight">nature</span> of their composition currently would prevent their holding the respect of the electorate when they inhibited the activities of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I did not hear the Minister during the first part of his comments, but because of the very substantial <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the matters which are referred to I take it that the Minister having taken the opportunity of making a statement to the House, the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  will allow the Opposition Parties during the days that remain before this Parliament rises to debate this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is also worth noting that last year in the review of the scheme which took place at the same time as the rehabilitation loan was increased, the maximum term for the repayment of the farm build-up loan was increased, from 20 years to 30 years and I think that indicates the very real requirement which exists for financing the operations of primary producers on terms which take account of the inevitable long term <span class="highlight">nature</span> of much of that form of investment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is unfortunate that schemes for rural reconstruction are necessary but I conclude with the words of Rachel Carson: The control of <span class="highlight">nature</span> is a phrase conceived in arrogance, born of the Neanderthal age of biology and philosophy, when it was supposed that <span class="highlight">nature</span> exists for the convenience of man’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As this project was planned during 1969-70 and has been held up awaiting the development of the infrastructure, particularly the port of Bunbury, will the Government reconsider its attitude on foreign capital investment in this instance, bearing in mind the true decentralised <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the project? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clearly, amendment of all Acts which concurrently allow statutory corporations to make their own acquisitions or arrange their own rentals would not be practicable for a long time to come, although recent amendments to the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Act 1973 and to the Australian National Airlines Commission Act 1973 have included appropriate amendments of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true that the Act does not formally require all foreign takeovers to be notified, but in these circumstances it is possible for the Government to draw conclusions as to both the incidence and the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of those proposals which are proceeded with and which cannot be revoked under the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would hope that we will get realistic constructive suggestions from the Opposition, and I hope we will be able to arrive at a way of using the resources of this House to allow more constructive proposals to be made at earlier stages than unfortunately has been the case when matters of this kind are debated in this way, when the debate seems to be very largely party political in <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whereas inflation, giving rise to increases in taxable incomes, yields a more than proportionate increase in taxation revenue due to the progressive <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the taxation scale, where a levy is involved it will yield only a proportional increase in revenue from the levy and the rate of levy will have to be increased to finance improvements in health care services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The real tragedy is also to be found in the appalling lack of understanding by the Australian Labor Party of the fundamental <span class="highlight">nature</span> of rural industry - its fluctuating, variable and unpredictable character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the point in this debate is that this action, coming on top of the other actions of an antirural <span class="highlight">nature</span> by this Government, is a watershed which has meant that no longer will people in Australia place any trust in or give any credence to anything this Government does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to seek the appropriation of sums totalling $168,575,000 for salaries and payments in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of salary, including the appropriation to specific divisions of a block sum of $32.5m appropriated in Appropriation Act (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Couple these crimes against <span class="highlight">nature</span> with the continued shortage of amenities that affect the everyday lives of our citizens - sewerage, schools, hospitals, recreation facilities, roads and highways and one becomes aware of the ghastly lack of planning that has accrued since our society developed into primarily an urban society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any speculation of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> which we heard earlier is merely designed to try to mislead people and is mischievous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the United Nations Special Committee of Twenty-four is soon to visit the Cocos Islands - the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of that committee’s work is well known - what advice will be given to it by Australia about independence or not? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Secondly, on ‘behalf of the Liberal Party since we have been in Opposition and following the viewpoints that I expressed when previously I was Minister for External Territories, I said that not only did we have a duty to ensure the smooth and orderly transition through self-government to independence in Papua New Guinea, but also we had a basic duty to ensure that both Papua New Guinea and Australia fully understood the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the relationship in a post-independence situation; that it would not be good enough to arrive at a date for independence and pass through it and then start discussions on the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the relationship between the then independent country of Papua New Guinea and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As this is one of the last opportunities I will have in this Parliament to put forward views of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>, it is my duty to signal them that he has not executed his duty in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It can be resolved only by negotiation and I wish the Government would pull its head out of the sand and recognise what it will have to face after 1 December if it does not discuss these 2 specific areas plus others in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of post-independence relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I now turn to the specific amendments of the Wool Industry Act 1972-1973, which are required in terms of the Government’s decision, and to a number of amendments of a machinery <span class="highlight">nature</span> which it is convenient to make at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is, the people, the contries and the governments of South-East Asia-  that what had changed was not the degree of Australian involvement in the region but the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and direction of that involvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fourth objective continued as follows: To explain that what has changed is not the degree of Australian interest or involvement but rather the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of that interest and involvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The degree to which this Government has failed to maintain past obligations prejudices that opportunity, lt is well that the Government now thinks of extending the program in the broader sense that we initiated but it is unfortunate that a trip of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> should have been necessary so that the Prime Minister could re-establish something of that close fraternal relationship that previously existed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As we become more sensitive to the creative <span class="highlight">nature</span> of men - and women - we can expect more support for these particular areas of instruction in the technical colleges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under this scheme miners are forced to retire at 62 years of age and the benefits merely save the Commonwealth paying social service benefits to people forced to retire, because of the heavy <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 say to honourable members that if events of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> were to develop in Papua New Guinea it would not be the people in London but it would be the people here in Canberra who would have to make decisions in relation to Papua New Guinea similar to those that were made by the honourable and gallant gentlemen in the House of Commons about Malaysia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As on that occasion, the total amount distributed will include an addi-‘ tional amount in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of further surplus that has accrued in the Fund since 1 July 1972 in respect of the surplus of $70,015,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think it is true to say that in the last couple of years we have seen, or have begun to see, the results of research projects which are inevitably long term in <span class="highlight">nature</span>, and promotion activities which although perhaps not so long term in <span class="highlight">nature</span> inevitably cannot show an immediate return. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When speaking of the research I am thinking of such research as that which went into machine washable garments, the development of non-fade pastel dyes incorporating drip-dry characteristics in woollen garments and work of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>, much of which I am pleased to say and as I am sure you will acknowledge,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  has been done in the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation’s wool-textile laboratories at Belmont in Geelong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other amendments in the Bill deal largely with machinery measures which stem from the changing <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Corporation since its setting up by the Liberal-Country Party Government in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, in relation to the social sciences, medical sciences and defence science, there were divergences of view as to what the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the council’s role should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is this House, as a debating chamber, any longer competent to perform that function, given the technical <span class="highlight">nature</span> of so much of what we have to handle, as effectively as it was conceived of being able to discharge it in the earlier history of the parliamentary system of government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Parliament is to delegate serious work to a Committee which can examine all the evidence on the matter and bring down a useful and reliable report, we must ensure in the future that the Prime Minister, the Minister for the Navy and every other parliamentarian come to understand the independent <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the work to be undertaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I hope to go on to show it will be a vital part of the work of the Committee to arrive at a decision on optimum siting of the General Post Office administrative block first, that is to say, in advance of its decision as to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the administrative block itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Probably the most insistent criticism has been that the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the plan, with the GPO building shutting off the northern end of Forrest Place, will result in the destruction of what otherwise would be a magnificent vista to the north. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the Committee will preside over an inquiry which will be extremely democratic in <span class="highlight">nature</span> - in fact, unprecedented in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Due to the very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the paper I shall start from the bottom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it does not and if the Bill is not passed, the stop go <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the building industry which prevailed in the 23 years of Liberal-Country Party Administration will continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fascination of this country, as of many other countries in the developed world, with the favourable comparison of, for example, Australia’s performance as a donor country has tended to obscure the real <span class="highlight">nature</span> of development and its relevance to Australia’s foreign policy, security and external economic interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nothing could be further from the truth in this case or more unfair to this Government on its record so far in cases where reports, often of a highly controversial <span class="highlight">nature</span>, have been submitted to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other problem which I can see emerging from our aid programs and which I would hope that .the Agency might turn to is that over the years, because of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of our Commonwealth involvement originally and then because of the constitution of a system which seems to have been successful, we have pursued a very extensive Colombo Plan aid educational program which has brought a great deal of opportunity to people who might otherwise have been denied it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part of the problem of the Colombo Plan is that the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of Australian training does not always suit the employment opportunities in the country of origin of the people receiving the training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But Australia’s long term interests surely must be a significant part of any decision that is ultimately taken as to the direction, <span class="highlight">nature</span>, quantum and character of aid provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course the very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of their fishing is somewhat primitive by contrast with the more sophisticated means of modern trawlers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The general <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the fishing industry and the fact that the prawns are very readily salable have meant that the industry in the Gulf of Carpentaria has attracted a good deal of investment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that we will always have some problems with superannuation funds of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> because, as has been mentioned earlier today, there are the problems of variations in our currency and our inflationary rates which we are finding very high at the moment, and of the opportunity for people making contributions to such a fund over a number of years to enjoy the same standard of living, or near enough to the same standard of living, on their retirement that they have been used to while being employed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An illustration of that neglect is that the enormous surplus produced by this scheme, is in fact money which was owed to Commonwealth public servants and which was never rightfully returned to them because the Government of the day - the Liberal-Country Party Government - was not interested enough to introduce a Bill of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> to implement a distribution after the last quinquennial investigation report of 1967, which I have here in my hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Minister for Secondary Industry and his gaggle of colleagues who represent the so-called Cabinet of this country are prepared to make loose allegations as to the success of their policies so far, let them face the music, let them go to a general election so that the people of this country will have an opportunity to record their vote, and to reject the discredited <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the present administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Regrettably, to the many people in Australia who now this week and towards the end of last week became increasingly aware of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of Government it will be something of a surprise to learn that major pieces of legislation such as the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill 1973, the Australian Industry Development Corporation Bill 1973 and the National Investment Fund Bill 1973 can be introduced into this Parliament after the upper House has seen fit to reject them, not for serious consideration and debate  m  this chamber but for an accele rated debate so that the measures can be pushed forward into the other chamber and can then be considered again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am very pleased that right at the start of proceedings you are pleased that I am here, and the good thing about being here, is that Lucas and Tait know that it’s my custom to come to occasions like this to say what I feel, and the first thing I want to say is that my visit is in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of a good neighbourly one, in that this building happens to be the accommodation for the headquarters, the Sydney headquarters, for the Department of Housing and Construction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However I repeat, we will not have a bar of this so-called Hayden or Labor health scheme because once it is implemented it will change the whole <span class="highlight">nature</span> of medical care in Australia and will, in fact, produce an egg which a future government will find impossible to unscramble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first reason is that it is human <span class="highlight">nature</span> for a person to conclude: ‘Well, if the Government is adding to my taxes to provide me and my family with free hospitalisation I may as well use it and get my money’s worth.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Human <span class="highlight">nature</span> being what it is, as soon as the rights of a professional man to practise in a free competitive society is taken away and he is forced to work in a government machine, creative achievements, ingenious new techniques, and the exploration of the perplexing problems of mankind will not be forthcoming and we all will be reduced to the level of mediocrity - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, human <span class="highlight">nature</span> impels us to use things if they are free, whether we need them or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the obvious problems in having a fixed hour of adjournment is that by its very <span class="highlight">nature</span> an adjournment debate quite often becomes a vitriolic attack by one side of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The remaining provisions in the Bill now before the House are consequential amendments of an administrative, <span class="highlight">nature</span> which flow from the principal provisions to which I have already referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many of the amendments were of a drafting <span class="highlight">nature</span> only - some of them to meet doubts that had been expressed whether or not the doubts were justified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Comments that have been made on this provision have tended to overlook the very limited <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I realise that these are basic and perennial questions, but I believe we have to answer them now in this Parliament because of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Government’s social welfare program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is proposed that the new Court would take over the original jurisdiction now exercised by the High Court under laws made by the Parliament, except for some few cases where, in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the jurisdiction, it seems appropriate for the High Court to continue to exercise it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This provision is made having regard to the special <span class="highlight">nature</span> of that jurisdiction, and to the fact that the Court would be, as already described, constituted in the same way as the Industrial Court for the exercise of that jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The committee must have at its disposal full information, particularly in relation to staffing, cost and the time occupied by committees in the work that they performed in the last 18 months because there has been a proliferation of committees of a <span class="highlight">nature</span> which has created some useful results, but in some other respects perhaps a degree of repetition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the inherent importance of recent exchange rate adjustments to the actual execution of this Bill, it is appropriate during this debate to comment briefly on the unsatisfactory <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Government’s exchange rate policy and to put forward the positive initiatives which have been developed by the Opposition parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition, of course, supports this amendment which is really of a purely technical <span class="highlight">nature</span> as it seeks to overcome any difficulty which may prevent this concession from operating in the way in which it was intended to operate - that is, that it should apply to all individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it must become a feature of government to table such studies with every project of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>, whether or not it is being carried out by the NCDC Let us face it; the National Capital Development Commission should not have any prior right to be exempt from the scrutiny of the Department of the Environment and Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to mention something about the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the construction, otherwise it will probably not find its way into Hansard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore he achieves nothing by quoting it, because what it demonstrates is that the interest policy of the Labor Party advanced home mortgage repayments of the home buyer by such an amount that the tax rebate of $250 as a result of this program does not compensate the home owner for the increased cost of higher interest rates, and that is the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the policy which this gentleman has supervised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the mechanisation by the ship owners and the many different ways of transporting cargo, people who belonged to unions other than the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, were performing tasks which were very similar in <span class="highlight">nature</span> to those tasks once performed by waterside workers but which, because of the introduction of technology and mechanisation on the waterfront, are now in fact vastly- different tasks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where there has been redevelopment of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> it has been of an undesirable standard, and far too often the redevelopment has taken place only to remove the people who traditionally lived in such areas and to facilitate the occupation of those areas by the privileged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although the Leader of the Opposition believes that the buildings in the Glebe area ought to be demolished and replaced with medium density development - no doubt what he is contending is of a desirable <span class="highlight">nature</span> - I want the House to know what these competent consultants said about the Glebe area from an architectural standpoint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, we have been told by some of our consultants that if this development were left to private enterprise nobody in this country would have the capacity to acquire the whole area, to enable the whole area to be pulled down if that were wanted and redevelopment to be planned in an overall way in order to achieve a sensible relationship of one building to another, thereby getting a proper sense of perspective in relation to landscaping, public amenities and things of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the other hand, ‘equal share’ becomes mixed up with all  sorts  of philosophies - many of a socialistic <span class="highlight">nature</span> - which ignore the need of man for an incentive to give of his best. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nobody complains that these services are not required but costs like those have to be met and it is for that reason, amongst others, that charges of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> have to be imposed from time to time in order not only to provide the service but also to enable money to be available for it from the revenue that is received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That Interim Report in its introduction comments that although the national superannuation scheme covered contingencies such as voluntary, early or deferred retirement, invalidity, widowed survivor, mortality grant for surviving spouse, unemployment and sickness, they, the members of the inquiry, concentrated initially on the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of a suitable scheme for ensuring adequate income for the aged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is of the opinion that an event of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> would be of immense public interest and that it is important that as complete a record as possible should be preserved for the nation’s archives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister sought to have a number of additional provisions inserted which would make it mandatory to refer the principal terms of an agreement to the members of an organisation and to describe the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the consultation with financial members of the organisation affected by the agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In many ways it would be more sensible for the ‘future of the manufacturing sector of the dairy industry in Australia to allow them to obtain loan funds so that they can switch to larger bulk milk vats of a refrigerated <span class="highlight">nature</span>, than it would to allow farmers in other areas to make the change because this area is viable and has all that is required to continue its viability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But if, the moment he receives this additional power from this legislation, he proceeds to act in an arbitrary manner, to penalise or attempt to penalise these organisations and, through them, the majority of the people in New South Wales, then he must be judged on this other basis of being out to kill anything of a private <span class="highlight">nature</span> in our health system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the second reading speech the Minister said that comparisons of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> I have made are misinformed and that the only really satisfactory comparison is the overall percentage of rural versus urban. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although  Sir Garfield  Barwick set forth the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Court and its jurisdiction which he favoured it fell to the lot of my immediate predecessor as Attorney-General,  Mr B.

    <p>It is not surprising that Australia’s capitalist system has faltered because capitalism by its <span class="highlight">nature</span> is ill-fitted to respond to the demands of a just and equitable society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Cancer organisations have had to concentrate on research and development activities of a limited <span class="highlight">nature</span> and on forming nationally important policies - for example on the question of cigarette smoking - and they have not been able to adequately fund a number of areas which are of critical importance in the control of cancer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-85">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is well and fitting and appropriate that on an historic occasion such as this, when the debate will be recorded in perpetuity, that the fallacious <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Labor Party’s administration and argument is recorded, particularly the way in which the honourable member for Dawson  (Dr Patterson),  who is the current Minister for the Northern Territory, vilified and attacked the member for Northern Territory  (Mr Calder). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He did not mean to bring it up to date by any referendum proposal but by legislation of a surreptitious <span class="highlight">nature</span> as is brought forward on this occasion- the third occasion before the Parliament of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other preliminary observation I make is that I wonder whether when those in the future come to read of this occasion- I forbear from using that adjective which seems to jar upon so many people- they will have a towering impression of the high sense of relevance that grips the Australian Parliament in dealing with a Bill of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>, to add 4 new senators to the Australian Parliament, at a time when the economy is tottering and when disaffection is present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the contrary I believe that the right course for this Government and this Parliament to follow is to take this matter to the Constitutional Conventions between the Commonwealth, the States and local government, to invite Territorial representatives to those conventions, and to have protracted discussion on the future <span class="highlight">nature</span> and structure of the Territories, their movement into full statehood and their representation in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the inherent strengths and weaknesses of human <span class="highlight">nature</span>, as soon as the rights and incentives of the professional man to practise in a free, competitive society are taken away and he is forced to work in a government machine, creative achievements, ingenious new techniques, break-throughs in knowledge and further explorations of the perplexing problems of mankind cease and we are all reduced to a level of mediocrity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No recognition has been given to grants; there are only these continuing damning attacks on anything of a federal <span class="highlight">nature</span> that is done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To force students into an ‘artist in a garret’ situation may be passed over as romantic remembrance by some, but for those who will be socially affected- perhaps those who fail their examinations- it is an indictment of the noncomprehensive and short-sighted <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the tertiary education policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill proposes the establishment of a professional service to enable the Australian Government, for the first time, to bring a coordinated approach to the management of <span class="highlight">nature</span> conservation resources in the areas under its direct control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Council of <span class="highlight">Nature</span> Conservation Ministers set up on this Government’s initiative will, I hope, help in the development of a national approach to the conservation of our unique fauna and flora. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The National Parks and Wildlife Service will also facilitate co-operation with the States in the national <span class="highlight">nature</span> conservation effort, and the meeting of Australia’s obligations under the increasing number of international agreements for the conservation of wildlife to which this Government has become a signatory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the Bill, the Service will be able to manage parks for a variety of purposes in addition to <span class="highlight">nature</span> conservation, such as tourism, recreation, and for scientific investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To achieve this protection the Australian Labor Party in its platform has pledged to ‘conserve for future generations adequate samples of Australia’s unique flora and fauna by the development of a comprehensive system of national parks, <span class="highlight">nature</span> and recreation reserves’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite obvious from the past, from the experience of everyone else in the world, that none of the tinkering with taxation or other measures of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> will solve the problems of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the Budget indicates that because it has no answer and the Government has no answers to these problems the Government should push on regardless with its social program which is incapable of implementation because of the very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the problems that we have before us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When one examines expenditure of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> and the matters that are dealt with, be they education, social reform- particularly the Australian assistance plan which is something I personally commend- or urban development and sewerage, one is reminded of the position of an individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not aware that any newspaper in Australia took up this Press release because of its scurrilous <span class="highlight">nature</span>, but apparently because the newspapers did not take it up the honourable member distributed it in the Greek clubs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I must say in passing that the honourable member for Adelaide  (Mr Hurford)  read out the first two sentences from the Press release and referred to them as being of a scurrilous <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely it must be clear even to the most obtuse of the Government’s Ministers that it is no real answer to unemployment to take a man who has been working in some special field and offer him employment as a labourer in the building of a swimming pool or toilets in Tasmania or something of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>, as was referred to by the Minister for Labor and Immigration  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  in this House yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although these three problems- the threat of chronic imbalances in international payments with consequent instability in the international financial system, the possibility of accelerating cost inflation and the threat of a world slump- have been evident since the beginning of this year, virtually nothing of a constructive <span class="highlight">nature</span> has been achieved towards their solution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The assessment of the amount of the grants was made by the Grants Commission and was based, firstly, on the revenue capacity of each applicant council as compared with constituent councils in the relevant region, consideration being given to the actual revenue being collected by the council; secondly, the required expenditure of the applicant council as compared with that of brother constituent councils in the region to provide a quality of services comparable with the services of” brother councils within the region and as compared with other regions; and, thirdly, the degree of disability or deficiency suffered by the council in the form of a physical <span class="highlight">nature</span>, such as area, topography or distances and disability in the form of population, such as sparse population or dense population requiring a greater intensity of public services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some relate to the peculiarities of the labour market- the changing <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the labour market Others are explained by political factors, the political argument being that business and unions are becoming increasingly aware of the fact that governments simply cannot maintain restrictive policies for too long because they have to face elections and as a result they are prepared to ride out the rough times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have known the Treasurer for a long time and it is not within his <span class="highlight">nature</span> to indulge in this kind of activity which should be desisted from by men of principle and men of character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not want to go into the techniques of calculating it but I put the proposition that of its <span class="highlight">nature</span> the consumer price index in a socialist economy becomes increasingly irrelevant as a reflection of real changes of costs to Australian homes and Australian households. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at the residual items that will have to be met by particular consumers it should be remembered that a compulsory tax of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> is not measured by the index whereas a voluntary payment, and especially that part of the voluntary payment which is unfunded, has to be calculated by the Statistician in the compilation of the index. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The consumer index, of its <span class="highlight">nature</span> and without any reflection on the operations of the Statistician, has to be in error in respect of these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope the Treasurer will look at them because the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Australian economy today gives rise to a situation where people do not know precisely the areas in which they are travelling, do not know the path of costs which they are traversing and have had put upon them- if only they knew this- a consumer price index misleading error as to the costs which they have to meet in looking after Australian homes and Australian households. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would have thought that, having regard to what was said during the debate this afternoon by several honourable gentlemen opposite, there would have been some measure of protest within the Government Party itself at the ramming through of a Bill of this highly complex <span class="highlight">nature</span> in a matter of, as things go now, 65 minutes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is at threat because the quality and quantity of meat protein available in Australia is likely to be seriously curtailed because the whole of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the cattle industry and, I would suggest, of the sheep industry, is threatened through inaction and the direct destructive action of the Labor Party in Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If members of the Opposition were more conscious of the opportunities that the Prices Committee offers the Government, they would know the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the reference and be more hesitant in extracting political capital out of what is a conscientious effort to give an open forum to industry groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reasons for choosing this region presumably were that it is a lower income region with pressing needs in all areas of social welfare and that in recent years an active group of concerned people had come together within the region to assess the needs of the area, to draw attention to the deprived <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the region and to press for action to overcome these social deficiencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On page 52 under the heading of ‘ Wildlife and National Parks’, which comes under section 7, ‘Culture and Recreation’, an amount totalling $9.9m, including $9m to the States, has been set aside for the acquisition of land for <span class="highlight">nature</span> conservation; a further $8m has been set aside to help the States preserve the national estate in accordance with the recommendation, I suppose, of the report of  Mr Justice  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not easy for the ordinary layman- indeed it is not easy for those of us in this House unless we spend a lot of time going through the Budget papers- to readily add together the total amount being spent in the preservation of the environment and in <span class="highlight">nature</span> conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest- I do so in a personal way- that those functions should include the environment and the national estate, urban and rural land use strategies and policies, anti-pollution, wildlife and <span class="highlight">nature</span> conservation, responsibility for the education of the community in conservation, water and soil resources and conservation policies, and the administration of those areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Really, this Parliament should be able to discuss the role that officers of the Department are playing in the United Nations environmental program, where Australia stands with regard to the Earthwatch program and what Australia is doing about the exposition on human habitat; yet, because of the very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the way in which things have been presented, this Committee does not have the opportunity to examine those programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are a number of other provisions in this Bill which are mainly procedural in <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The full development of the resources of the Burdekin Basin will be of a long-term <span class="highlight">nature</span> with considerable national significance for industrial and regional development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not suggest for one moment these measures have been taken out of illwill, a lack of concern or a lack of sensitivity as to what is needed in these areas, but I suggest that unless many other criteria are used by its very <span class="highlight">nature</span> the legislation is wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Children cannot be kept on $2 a week, and to make distinctions of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> is to make a mistake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have heard tonight that there is solid reason for instituting a program which has led to grants of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> being passed through these Houses of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendments set out in the Schedule to the Bill are of a purely formal <span class="highlight">nature</span>, for the purpose of applying current drafting practices to the provisions of the principal Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Although I believe the statement on this issue was perfectly clear, I ask the Prime Minister to give further information on this proposal so that the House and also Australian wage and salary earners may confirm the exact <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the concept contained in the statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is only one cure for this problem in the short term and that is for the Government to make a strenuous effort to make available some finance, but not in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of a grant The industry does not ask for it It has been proud of the independence it has demonstrated over the years but in this situation where it has fallen victim to circumstances far beyond its control it has a moral entitlement to look to the Government to provide financial means to bridge this period of disaster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This deduction, which is in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of a concession, in effect frees from tax a basic 2 per cent return on policy holders’ funds, and this ultimately goes to policy holders in tax free form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have said, other provisions of the agreement are largely conventional in <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Commission’s task that in any year some local authorities will receive lower grants than their neighbouring councils or shires, and some authorities will not receive any grants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My own association with local government has been over a 31 -year period, so I have been able to see the great change that has taken place in this sphere of government over a long time- one could say from the horse and buggy days, with requirements only for the repair of footpaths and roads and items of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>, to the present time when local government is required to provide all modern amenities with an outmoded method of financing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think honourable members should refrain from statements of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> or, if they are illinformed, should make no statements at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Mr Deputy Speaker, I would not like to transgress against your gentle <span class="highlight">nature</span> and I hope, therefore, that you would find it a tolerable irrelevance on my part if I say to the Minister for Education  (Mr Beazley)  how glad I am to see him back from his travel abroad and to see him looking fit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am prepared to concede that the very great part of political conflict is, as the term would imply, of a combative <span class="highlight">nature</span> but there are some occasions when I would hope that some measure of generosity of attitude could pervade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Commission believes that in the present circumstances and given the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of school budgeting any favourable adjustments to recurrent expenditure grants to schools should take into account all costs increases that have occurred since the dimensions of the Government’s program were first determined, and should also provide for future increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact the figures in the Budget statements show quite clearly that talk of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> is completely off key. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to say this for the sake of the honourable member for Bennelong who was proving, what I at any rate would never have disputed, the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of this Bill: In order to offset recent cost increases and thus maintain the purchasing power of the original financial recommendations of the Interim Committee of the Schools Commission, the Government agreed to supplement both recurrent and capital funds made available to schools through the programs of financial assistance administered by the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am surprised also that the Government should proceed with a Bill of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>, particularly in view of the fact that, under legislation which the Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory  (Dr Patterson),  who is at the table, was responsible for, we witnessed the conduct of an election in the Northern Territory to return 19 members to the new Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By the very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of my answer to the honourable member it will be apparent that I took the question without notice to mean that I was being asked to publish the text of the letters I had received from the Premiers, to which I replied in the negative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-41-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It made a very serious error when it cut tariffs across the board by 25 per cent without any consideration of whether the industries affected were decentralised industries or under competition and without considering the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the work force or whether there were women in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the concomitants of a government’s taking a decision to provide a scheme of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> is its readiness to do the same in relation to other people for whom it has responsibility and who are similarly placed, because I contend that there is no difference between a DFRB pensioner under the pre-October scheme and a parliamentary pensioner who retired, say, 20 years ago and whose pension under new legislation, regardless of the amount contributed, will automatically become 50 per cent or more than 50 per cent higher, depending on his period of service, of the existing parliamentary salary and any increases in parliamentary salary which might be granted in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think I could quote perhaps not from his words but from his intention when he said it was felt that the demands imposed on servicemen and the distinctive <span class="highlight">nature</span> of their work warranted incorporation of their retirement benefits in a special scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be more becoming the stature of a commission of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> to have its independence put in a position where it can, on its own judgment, respond to a request from the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I am bringing up is the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the consistent lying which is taking place in this House and to the country by Ministers and by the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite improper for the Minister to consider reducing services of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that if there is one mistake that has been made it was not the mistake of attempting to reduce the level of tariffs, it was the precipitate <span class="highlight">nature</span> of that reduction and the grossness of the measure; but the necessary response in Australia to this slashing of tariffs did not occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Capital resources, human and material resources should have gone, and should have been enabled to go, to those areas where we could work at what we do best, and if there was a philosophical road block in respect of those matters it was that, having made the decision about tariffs, an interventionist socialist government could not of its <span class="highlight">nature</span> allow the necessary reallocation of capital and of human resources to fulfil those purposes, to do what other Ministers have called those things that we can do best. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Bill makes it quite clear- I return to the 2 precise points- that in respect of changes in the money situation in Australia and changes in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the credit squeeze in Australia a government is responsible and that in relation to the supply of money a government and the Reserve Bank are responsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me that events in recent years, particularly during the mining boom, have drawn attention to the need to tighten up the legislation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This legislation will have the effect of ensuring that Australian money is protected within Australia and that the professional rogues will not be able to shift money from Australia to tax havens or to salt it away in Swiss banks and things of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>, particularly if there is a tax element involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was mentioned by my colleagues earlier in this debate that clause 39 is one of a quite critical <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is perfectly obvious from the history of mankind that it is basic to human <span class="highlight">nature</span> that when legislation exists people will always seek to find ways around it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The amount of money which is involved is probably not significant enough to have a serious effect on budgeting but it is Australia’s resources and the assets of Australian people, as opposed to the community and to the society, that are at stake when we are dealing with these unscrupulous company promoters and people of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say to the Minister, not with any heat at all, because that is rather foreign to my <span class="highlight">nature</span>, that one of the great pities of this Parliament is the reluctance of the honourable gentleman and of many of his colleagues in the Government to allow a reasonable Committee debate upon Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst it is inevitable with legislation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> that there are some measures included in the amendments with which I agree and perhaps with which all members of the House agree, it is essential that we should turn our attention to the central provisions of the proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly the efforts of  Colonel Rose,  who I think has retired, have been monumental in the field of <span class="highlight">nature</span> conservation in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the second area of concern- the preservation of the rights of the States in regard to wildlife control- the Minister expressed the hope that the Council of <span class="highlight">Nature</span> Conservation Ministers would help to achieve co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Council of <span class="highlight">Nature</span> Conservation Ministers has been singularly unsuccessful in this regard, and this has been due to the present Government’s actions in respect of kangaroo conservation - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the first actions taken by  Dr Cass  was to promote the formation of a Council of <span class="highlight">Nature</span> Conservation Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Moreover, I believe that if the Australian Government acquired and proclaimed any areas under its control in the States in the interests of <span class="highlight">nature</span> and wildlife consevation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition supports the initiatives which the Government is taking with regard to the management of <span class="highlight">nature</span> conservation resources in areas under its direct control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The States Grants (<span class="highlight">Nature</span> Conservation) Bill is a Bill which will provide finance for the State governments to become further active in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They cover national monuments which are land and water areas of lesser acreage than national parks but have great significance, usually of a scientific <span class="highlight">nature</span>; historical areas; recreational areas- (Quorum formed)  Mr Speaker,  when I was interrupted I was listing a number of things that are under the control of national parks and wildlife commissions overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly enough the draftsman has cast his net as widely as possible and the result may be that the constitutional right of the national Parliament to participate in the field of <span class="highlight">nature</span> conservation, both within the Territories and the States, will be substantiated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An amendment which we propose to move and to which I am optimistic that the Government will agree, will ensure that no land in a State can be acquired by the Commonwealth for a park or wildlife reserve which is dedicated or reserved under a law of a State for purposes related to <span class="highlight">nature</span> conservation or the protection of areas of historical, archaelogical or geological importance or areas having special significance for Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be that in some circumstances it may not be a matter of concern because the convention is of a minor <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Minister’s second reading speech he refers to the Council of <span class="highlight">Nature</span> Conservation Ministers which was set up on the Government’s initiative to develop a national approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is responsible for areas such as national parks, State parks, historic sites, <span class="highlight">nature</span> reserves and Aboriginal relics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the end of the clause add the following sub-clause: ‘(2) Land shall not be acquired by Australia for the purposes of this Part if it is land that is dedicated or reserved under a law of a State, without consent of (he State, for purposes related to <span class="highlight">nature</span> conservation or the protection of areas of historical, archaeological or geological importance or of areas having special significance in relation to Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intention of this whole exercise- people generally will not realise it because it is accepted in this place- is that the legislation should be associated with State grants for <span class="highlight">nature</span> conservation purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If approval or authority is to be given for mining to be undertaken on Kakadu National Park or in any other area that is reserved or proclaimed for the purposes of wildlife and <span class="highlight">nature</span> conservation I believe that this should be done by the corporate body of the executive of the Government itself rather than that power being vested in the hands of a sole Minister who, being a Minister for Minerals and Energy could, of course, have a degree- and I do not say this would be the case with the present Minister for Minerals and Energy but at some future date a Minister for Minerals and Energy could be a mining fanatic - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-A.s I read sub-clause (2) of clause 10, what it is really saying is that not only must mining, which by definition includes prospecting and exploration, be done with the approval of the Minister for Minerals and Energy but it can only be mining of a non-private <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>those licences depend on the interpretation of the words ‘no right, title or interest is vested in a person other than Australia’ and that those words would be wide enough to cover a right in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of an exploration licence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason is that if it is a wilderness area, but under the plan of management it is accessible to those hardy souls who wish to pit themselves against <span class="highlight">nature</span> in the wilderness, they do not want to feel that if they do go into the area God, in the form of the director, is hovering over them caring for their safety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>After all, if the States Grants (<span class="highlight">Nature</span> Conservation) Bill is passed $9m will be allocated for that purpose alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>( 1 ) An allegation, in an information in respect of an offence against this Act,  the  regulations or the by-laws, that any lands in question form part of a national park, historic site, <span class="highlight">nature</span> reserve, Aboriginal area, protected archaeological area, wildlife district, wildlife refuge or game reserve shall be sufficient without proof of the matter so alleged unless the defendant proves to the contrary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But why should there be an unlimited provision of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> under which an averment or statement can be made and then the onus of proof passes to the defendant? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Full credit must go to the former Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Lowe,  Mr McMahon,  for the first initiative in recognising the environment as a dimension that should be taken into consideration when coming to a decision on any proposal of a structural <span class="highlight">nature</span> or otherwise which might affect the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  Deputy  Leader of the Australian Country Party  (Mr Sinclair)  and I have just pointed out the totally one-sided <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the negotiations if such they can be called- arrangements involving only one side of an argument- which are proposed in section 20A (1). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without the use of phosphatic fertiliser many of the farmlands of Australia will regress inevitably to low productivity levels in spite of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the seasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be an act of criminality on the part of the Opposition parties so to distort the processes of parliamentary government because, whilst the benefit to them may be of a temporary <span class="highlight">nature</span>, as it would be, in the long term they will cause people to lose all respect for the system of government in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has to understand the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of this problem before it can seek to solve it and the great problem is that the Government does not understand it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now however serious our own problems and however acute my concern about them- and I trust my concern is not in questionI believe as Prime Minister, in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of his office, has a special and at times an overriding duty to promote Australia’s place in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It means that an honourable member must get the permission of the  Speaker  or whoever is in charge of the House at the time to make a personal explanation in relation to a matter of a personal <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The expenditure by political parties and candidates at the 1974 Senate and House of Representatives elections on broadcasting and televising time on commercial stations alone was in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of $ 1.5m and in this connection I quote from the Australian Broadcasting Control Board ‘s 26th annual report on its operations during the year ended 30 June 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With respect to clause 6 (a), in which the functions of the Commission inter alia are expressed to assist the Australian Government in determining the desirable extent, <span class="highlight">nature</span> and purposes of the use and development of the Darwin area’, the phrase ‘desirable extent’ is confusing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In relation to clause 8 (3), I would like to raise the question of whether the Commission should determine the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and extent of public investment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many leaders in the community from the professions, among social workers and in the churches have pointed to the changes which will be introduced into the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of marriage and threaten the stability of the family if this Bill is passed without amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the purpose of proceedings under this Act, a union in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of a marriage which is, or has at any time been, polygamous, being a union entered into in a place outside Australia, shall be deemed to be a marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Bearing in mind the major <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the step and the thought that almost always lies behind it, 12 months provides a sensible cooling off period to guard against hasty divorces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not possible for this legislation to transform human <span class="highlight">nature</span>, no matter how much it may try to do so, for when one partner to a marriage contract feels wronged and hurt he or she, despite the divorce laws passed by this Parliament, will dispute with just as much determination, passion and personal expenditure matters of money and property and, naturally enough, the custody of the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These changes do not, I believe, reflect present community values and attitudes, for this very significant Bill would affect the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of all marriages, not merely those that will end in dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the combination of the proposed maintenance provisions and the 12 months separation provision as the sole ground for divorce will transform the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and legal concept for marital relationships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-One of the difficulties in a debate of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> obviously is the fact that most members of the Parliament- and I talk of members on both sides of the Parliament- do not understand the relationship between candidate and Party, party and business and /or trade union, and all those elements and the media. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But that does give one an insight into the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On a personal point, I should also add that I have been divorced once and I have been happily married twice, so I have had some personal experience of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the problems that can flow from a marriage that has failed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will never change human <span class="highlight">nature</span> to a great extent- we all know that- but there is no good inflaming it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They concern the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the marriage itself and make it clear that the package no fault is not a package that has any truth; that the socalled relegation of indignity and bitterness is not relegated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The existing Barwick divorce law is attracted by the action of parties to take steps to divorce, but this law is attracted by the fact that people marry because it is changing the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of marriage in the Australan community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before indicating the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the main provisions in the Bill I shall say a word or two about some of the basic requirements for such legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is also his <span class="highlight">nature</span> to apply a commonsense attitude to a problem when it has been shown that abuses could follow from the change that was made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, they can be briefly summarised as follows: The decline in the profitability of existing investment due to accelerating wage and salary costs; the degree of import competition; the prohibitive cost and the scarcity of long-term investment finance; the downturn in demand; the distortive impact of inflation and the obsolescent <span class="highlight">nature</span> of present accounting practices; the punitive and unrealistic operations of the Prices Justification Tribunal; and the serious erosion of business confidence arising from uncertainty and confusion as to this Government’s intentions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is equally absurd to deliver statements and issue Press releases about the serious <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the investment downturn and then to neglect completely the need for a decisive and long-term investment program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, I believe that if this proposal were to pass into law it would alter fundamentally the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and role of the Senate in the Australian Parliament, a role which in the years to come will be of increasing importance and a role which I believe is contributing greatly to effective government in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>… On all general questions, including even some questions of a constitutional <span class="highlight">nature</span> having a general import … it must be recognised how much the tribunal has of late years done, and is daily doing, to stabilise and harmonise the fundamental law of the Empire, to find and enforce the basic principles of jurisprudence on which modern civilisation rests, and to assist the development of free institutions in the constitutional units of the British Commonwealth of Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be influenced by the federal or unitary <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the constitution and whether it is written or unwritten, by the legislative procedure in Parliament, by the ease with which parliamentary time can be found to effect amendments in the law which concern only a small minority of citizens, by the extent to which Parliament has been in the habit of intervening to reverse judicial decisions by legislation; but most of all by the underlying political philosophy of the particular nation as to the appropriate limits of the lawmaking function of a non-elected judiciary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Notwithstanding the force of the arguments the Attorney-General  (Mr Enderby)  used when he closed the debate on the last Billthat there were very strong legal reasons as to why all appeals to the Privy Council, either from the High Court or from other courts within Australia should be abolished- the plain fact of the matter is that the considerations which have brought the Government to the decision it made in respect to both Bills and which, in respect of this Bill we are presently debating, produce total support from the Opposition, are considerations of a political <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The main purpose of this Bill is to amend certain provisions of the Commonwealth Railways Act 1917-1973 in order to create the Australian National Railways Commission, thus providing for the increasingly wider functions and responsibilities of Commonwealth Railways including the transfer of State railways; to ensure that the powers, duties and functions of the proposed Commission are, where possible, consistent with other statutory authorities with a similar <span class="highlight">nature</span>; to make amendments to the Act, which will bring it into line with current commercial practices of statutory authorities; and to overcome administrative problems raised by the Auditor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are many others who are not in gaol and who have been bailed up as bankrupts who,- 1 am sure, are capable of running their own affairs and I am sure they are capable of running a Council and boards of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There also is a close relationship between this question and the degree of independence which these committees must be given under their democratically elected chairmen because, as with any large organisation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>, we are running a real risk of the octopus syndrome- the heart hes in the middle, the tentacles go out in all directions to the various areas of the arts, but ultimately they are all directed back towards the centre and the administrative section of the centre grows and grows in accordance with the best Parkinsonian principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Like the honourable member for Franklin  (Mr Sherry),  I regard this matter as part of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the beast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I come back to the point that this is part of the problem, part of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the beast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I advance the proposition that where as the paid officials of the Council are by <span class="highlight">nature</span> to be permanent or reasonably permanent officers- there is a provision under clause 9 (2) (c) for departmental or statutory corporation officers to be permanent members of the Council- the artists in the field, as it were, the part-time artist members of the Council, are not in fact given permanent membership of the Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In all sincerity, I ask the Attorney-General  (Mr Enderby)  to note this point: One ofthe main difficulties associated with corporate crime is not so much the reliability of the kind of evidence tendered by the prosecution but that the traditional jury by the very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of its composition is generally unable to appreciate and evaluate the evidence placed before it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of their work they are often able to take a broad view of a whole industry that people in the industry or a particular part of it have difficulty in taking because their experience has not given them the breadth of view that sometimes a senior public servant has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that ‘reasonable excuse’ certainly would include a situation of privilege such as he described or the self-incriminatory aspect, although one has to take into account also that there are plenty of examples in our law going back many years- I am thinking in particular of customs and excise type law- where because of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the situation burdens of proof are put unashamedly on the accused and all sorts of prefatory averments exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is this a set fee for every application or does it have a relationship to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the corporation, the size of it, the capital of it or what? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely the answer is for the industry to learn the rules of a body which has a continuing <span class="highlight">nature</span> and deal with it rather than to expect a similarly satisfactory situation to result from the putting of all these regulationsregulations which cannot have the flexibility that the proposed Commission’s regulations will have- into law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a clause which I hope would never be resorted to by any government, because plainly recourse to a provision of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> would be taken only in the gravest emergency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It could well be that a hearing before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal under sub-clause 8 of clause 65, which deals with appeals to that Tribunal, may result in the Tribunal, on hearing arguments on the point asking what was the basis, what was the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the particulars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To write into a piece of legislation a provision that without the existence of any just cause, excuse or reason for suspecting wrongdoing an officer of the Commission shall be entitled to attend meetings of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> is to so extend the surveillance of the Commission into the private affairs of members of an exchange as to defy justification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the gear involved, as well as the processing requirements, it is an industry which must continually seek to expand its market opportunities, particularly within an environment of raging inflation of the sort to which I have already referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As was observed, from the place where the present Attorney-General  (Mr Enderby)  sits at the table, by one of his most distinguished predecessors, the now Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, a very great Australian and a very great judge, when he introduced the Matrimonial Causes Bill, now the Act 1959-1 can recall him standing at that dispatch box and saying: ‘It is not of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of human <span class="highlight">nature</span> to have the saintliness of Hosea’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The United States Congress is probably more unpredictable because of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of Congress than it had been in past years and that is, I suppose, because there are not some significant figures who support or who are noted for a cause and who carry Congress with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On this basis I am convinced that a 12-month separation period by a unilateral decision of one partner will weaken the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the contract, will produce an attitude damaging to the values of the institution of marriage and therefore will not act as a buttress to society’s structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I also rise in this debate to speak briefly because I realise that the time that has been taken up in considering this matter has been lengthy and that there is very little of a fresh <span class="highlight">nature</span> that can be added to the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I put it to honourable members that the delay that has taken place because of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the subject- it is a matter on which people form very strong views- indicates that there will not be any solution reached in a select committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course that by itself would not be persuasive but on the information that comes to me it is not being abused and it is serving a very useful place in that other type of legislation, given the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that the Government or honourable members could accuse the Opposition of pettifogging or nitpicking but we think that as a minimum requirement, if somebody makes a complaint of a serious <span class="highlight">nature</span> like this, at least it should be made in writing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the honourable member for Bennelong  (Mr Howard)  has already said, it may be that something of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> may need to be added subsequently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We do not think we can go very much further than that, given the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the problem that exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It seems that having regard both to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the amendments we have moved so far to this legislation, and to our attitude to the Superior Court of Australia, the existence of sub-clauses (4) and (8) are unnecessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are very strong and valid reasons why jurisdiction of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> ought not necessarily be exercised by a Superior Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my view- I admit that I have not made a formal count- the overwhelming number of the Aboriginals who would be affected by this BUI would be opposed to the proposals which the minister is bringing forward in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that in order to clear the air the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the controls, of the rallying points, for each of these applications- the one that exists now and the one for the controlling interest in station 5KA- deserves to be investigated by the Board, and more questions should be asked than the Board has so far asked in respect of the application by Festival City Broadcasters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I emphasise those 2 main grounds for objectionthe individual <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the position of members of Parliament in this Parliament and the legal difficulties and confusion that will arise with party names, with the tremendously cumbersome provisions that cover 6 pages of material which, when one reads it carefully, raises a lot of questions in people’s minds and therefore does not give the certainty that is necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I as a private member of Parliament am to be forced to make an association with a party which is binding and which will be represented on the ballot papers, and things of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>, I think that this is something which should be taken very seriously and be looked at a lot more seriously than it has been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second matter that I want to refer to, because I think it is necessary that it be stated in this debate, is that this particular disaster, as all honourable members will recall, was one of two of an extraordinary <span class="highlight">nature</span> that occurred during the most recent overseas visit of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Housing and Construction  (Mr Les Johnson),  who is sitting at the table, and his Government are directly responsible for the depressed <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Australian building industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When one looks at the reasons for the 3,000 to 4,000 rejections under the scheme each year one starts to get some sort of insight into the anomalous <span class="highlight">nature</span> of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Within the Attorney-General’s Department there has been developed a natural bias towards the legal <span class="highlight">nature</span> and the legal operations of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There can be no doubt as to our general attitude towards legislation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> and the need to provide a more co-ordinated system for the review of administrative discretions and decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In many ways, from the very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the position of the ombudsman, certain limitations of scope and operation necessarily exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the delays are noticeable, is this further evidence of the inefficient and unsatisfactory <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the present private health insurance scheme? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There have been numerous complaints of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">nature</span> and extent of competition between the traditional Australian pack of mushrooms in butter sauce and imported mushrooms in brine was far from clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Between 1968-69 and 1972-73 final consumption expenditure of a non-capital <span class="highlight">nature</span> increased by about 58 per cent, while total receipts, not including advances on loans, increased by only 49 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The extent to which this will occur will depend on the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and flexibility of the conditions imposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I mentioned earlier the administrative problems caused by the complex <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the present superannuation arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the legislation it is important, firstly, that honourable members be given reasonable opportunity to present their point of view and to suggest, if necessary, how the legislation might be improved and, secondly, for the Bill to be debated and decided on as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say to the House that we are completely in accord with the idea of initiating debate on the Family Law Bill at clause 48 which is, after all, the core in a consideration of the legislation and indicates the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the changes which the Family Law Bill itself proposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On matters such as abortion reform and on other matters of a social <span class="highlight">nature</span> it has been the practice of the Government to allow a free vote, but so that the votes may be taken procedures have been laid down and endorsed on party lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I have moved this motion which is procedural in <span class="highlight">nature</span> and merely clears the way for an omnibus question to be put deleting the word ‘Office’ wherever it occurs in the Bill and substituting the  word  ‘Corporation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That by its very <span class="highlight">nature</span> is- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This decision is simply again a stark reflection of the haste in which the legislation was formulated and the inaccuracy and misleading <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the second reading speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Practices of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> apply in respect of a number of State Government insurance offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have adverted to sufficient of them to expose the falsity and misleading <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the claims made by the Minister in his second reading speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say that I am astonished by the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the attack that has been waged in this House today by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lynch),  who spoke for the Liberal Party, and the Leader of the National Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  against the creation of a new insurance office which will operate, if one may say so, as a ‘pigmy’ among the 50 or so life insurance offices and 200-odd general insurance companies that already exist in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I say, because of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the society in which we live most of those areas of insurance are necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>It is being introduced at a time when the Insurance Acts rationalisation is taking effect and at a time when the insurance industry, like all other industries but by its very <span class="highlight">nature</span> especially, is feeling the effects of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One wonders whether, on a closer examination of the legislation than we have had in a fortnight, one would find many more faults of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>More importantly, he told me that staff in his office were concerned at the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the propaganda campaign being waged by the insurance industry, that they had held a meeting in their office that morning and that they had resolved that they would advise their head office that their company should withdraw from the campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Speaker, with a remarkable degree of anticipation I thought I might get a question of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> so I have come prepared for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given indexation of price movements for wages up to average weekly earningsthat covers people receiving up to about $150 a week- given the annual review on productivity which the Commission has decided shall apply, and given the right at any time to prove anomalies or by work value studies to prove that there has been a change in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the work, an increase will then be granted and provided of course that transitional anomalies are removed after they are proven, we believe that this is the only rational way of organising wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is important is the mischievous <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the article. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is essential that in our redefinition we have an ear not only to the fundamental <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the institution of marriage but also to the needs and demands of a changing society and to basic principles of justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He suggested that, as far as possible with legislation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>, we should endeavour to arrive at some consensus as to the widely held views of people in the community in relation to what our divorce laws should state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, legislation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> must cater for the spectrum of community views on divorce and marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that in undefended suits it is the procedure, which it is necessary to go through in seeking a favourable settlement, and the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of divorce itself which cause the humiliation, bitterness and unhappiness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Surely, in a Bill of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>, we should not be simply seeking a compromise so that both sides have honour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was concerned at the comment that the average amount of time spent by judges in dealing with cases is in fact of a very limited <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly when one looks at the matters in clause 48 that have to be proved to the court, they are of a very much more limited <span class="highlight">nature</span> than the matters that formerly had to be evidenced to the court to enable it to grant a decree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, there may be nothing directly of a legal <span class="highlight">nature</span> that the Government can do to prevent this action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But still, at the risk, as I said, of incurring the Attorney-General’s displeasure that I should presume to bother the parens patria of this country on a matter of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>, I should like to know from the Attorney-General what he has in mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first amendment which involves the introductory words of the clause it is intended to remove the mandatory <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the opening words so as to allow the court a discretion in the matters which it may take into account when determining maintenance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But during the debate on that clause a suggestion was made that if a similiar amendment were moved to clause 75 it would gain greater support, and I believe that this is a more appropriate place for the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the amendment I moved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reason why I move this motion is that the very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the resolution passed by this House a few days ago, at the insistence of the Leader of the House, precludes us on this side of the chamber from canvassing any other matters whatsoever while the Family Law Bill remains unresolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That financial policy would conform more closely to the position in the private insurance companies if clause 34 were amended to ensure that the Board pursues the policy of making a profit that is comparable with sound commercial enterprises, that is, make a reasonable return to the Australian Government on all the funds employed in the operation of the business of insurance of a commercial <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government is not prepared to accept the amendment for the simple reason that what is not required, particularly in dealing with matters of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> which require compassion, understanding and a certain amount of flexibility, is putting down in legal terms what will be the strict limitations of a person’s rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So before the trienniumn is over there will be further Bills of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> to authorise additional funds to be made available to universities and colleges of advanced education with particular reference to the 1975 year, because there will be the additional costs that those bodies so funded will have to meet as a consequence of wage and salary increases and other cost rises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As mentioned in the Prime Minister’s reply on 5 December 1974 (Hansard, page 4825) publicity is given in the Public Service Board ‘s Annual Reports to the manner in which these provisions can be used by departments to secure the services of specially qualified individuals on a non-career basis, or to perform tasks of an isolated short-term <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-45-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That just shows what a shallow, mean-minded person I was, to think the Minister and his trusted lieutenants would have left a gap of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, it is completely ad hoc in <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the proposals put forward in these clauses would emanate, I have no doubt, from the detailed examination made of the recommendations of the Commission by the inter-departmental working group to which the Minister referred in his second reading speech, and are generally of a non-controversial <span class="highlight">nature</span> so far as the main thrust of the Bills is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would urge the Government to consider the case of those who have retired and to consider more seriously than apparently it has to date whether it is equitable to include a clause of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> in the Bill before the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The last part of the honourable gentleman ‘s question was, in my opinion, of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A comprehensive summary setting out the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the changes in the duty rates and the origin of each alteration contained in the proposals is now being circulated to honourable members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This action is necessary because of the urgent <span class="highlight">nature</span> of these Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The truth is not that there is an urgent <span class="highlight">nature</span> to the Bills which requires the suspension of Standing Orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has stated 2 premises to explain the urgent <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On the last occasion when matters of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> were debated the Opposition put up the honourable member for Bennelong  (Mr Howard)  to try to defend the fort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I am extremely disappointed that my friend and former colleague, the right honourable member for Higgins  (Mr Gorton),  has found it in himself to support a guillotine of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I want to come back to the real <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the problem and the realities of the situation after having been taken on a safari, as it were, by the Special Minister of State  (Mr Lionel Bowen). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to that, it was clearly understood that the Government, because of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of uranium- after all, it is a weapons source as much as being a source of energy- wanted to have some say in the sale of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat my initial comments: Remarks of this kind in a debate of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> are disgraceful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall conclude with regard to this point by emphasising again the request I made earlier that, in the event of there being a substantial change in lending policies so far as the terms of loans are concerned, the Minister will make an announcement and indicate to the House and to the nation the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of that change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The long term <span class="highlight">nature</span> of those programs is such that flexibility will be required in the initial stages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this case it is not hard to understand why the State governments have readily agreed, not only because of the persuasiveness and co-operative <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Minister but also because of the flow of funds to the various State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This will refer not only to the Albury-Wodonga complex but also to any other projects of a similar <span class="highlight">nature</span> throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal that I put is that the students who wish to increase substantially the costs of running universities ought to be required to make a choice as to whether they want to see expanded building programs of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> that we have before us or alternatively whether they want to accept some respite for the moment in advancing of separate expenditure programs in terms of increased allowances which I consider to be of an exceptionally high character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister for Labor and Immigration  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  responds to the gentle stimulus which we have provided by earlier amendments and by this amendment and brings in legislation of a permanent <span class="highlight">nature</span> before 1 July 1976 then of course this legislation would cease to have effect as from that date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only does this provision recognise that there were many difficulties inherent in determining the keel laying date under a contract and sticking to the schedule involved, but it also recognises the essentially irrelevant <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the keel laying for the purpose of determining the bounty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Government, in giving instructions to its own survey collectors, will have to advise them to utilise whatever tact is appropriate, but under no circumstances to allow objections, whether they be valid objections or contrived objections, to destroy the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the survey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As occurs in so many matters of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> where there are genuinely held views across a spectrum, a consensus has to be achieved, and the Opposition’s view is that the correct way of approaching it is to put emphasis on conciliation and education, to decriminalise the procedures originally proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the main reasons for lack of confidence in the Australian shipbuilding market is the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the ships which have been constructed in Australia since 1947, when financial assistance was first granted to the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Privacy Committee, in recommendation 9, proposed that the claim forms should not require a claimant to specify the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of illness for which the service was given and the claim forms which will be used by the Health Insurance Commission do not require this information to be given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, there are cases where the correct assessment of the claim may necessitate the patient or doctor providing the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of illness to clarify the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of treatment rendered and this information is already sought by private health insurance funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the absence of this information relating to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of illness, and in the event of a dispute arising as to benefit entitlement, a claimant may well receive lower benefits than he would have received had the information been provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Their arguments, however, lose sight of the fact that there is already a large body of federal legislation which would fall to be interpreted and administered by a federal superior court in which the legal problems of a jurisdictional <span class="highlight">nature</span> that have been urged as objections against the Superior Court would have no place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was openly stated by the former Treasurer and it is on public record that such actions were taken because of the unorthodox <span class="highlight">nature</span>, the unconventional rearrangement which occurred in the international financial scene following the massive diversion of international liquidity into petrodollars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-139-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was because once again the members of the Ministry who were concerned with that Executive Council minute were apprehensive that if the Solicitor-General or the Permanent Head of the Attorney-General’s Department had been listened to the whole of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Executive Council minute would have been declared invalid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-139-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only conclusion that one can reach through the whole of the machinations and the manner of the deceiving of the States through the temporary purposes conception of that Executive Council minute is that at no stage did the Government intend to reveal to those who have a responsibility in the States the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of its intentions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-139-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that the States still hold that view very strongly, because in 1973 I think four- certainly three- of the Premiers went to the United Kingdom to petition the Queen, the Prime Minister and other Ministers in the United Kingdom not to pass any legislation of this request <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have said previously too in the House that despite the skeletal <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Act, in many respects it has been a very effective piece of legislation and many matters that are not covered by the Act have been able to be dealt with by administrative arrangement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He, of course, does not want to remember that those guidelines which operated as a directive to the Reserve Bank, which put certain restrictions on capital coming into this country, the purpose for which that capital could be utilised and the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the businesses and enterprises to which it could be directed, really did a tremendous job of work for the development of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Moreover, the non-public <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Treasury considerations as allowed for under this legislation, namely an interdepartmental committee, means that many interested persons will be unaware of the proposed acquisition of Australian assets and therefore cannot be in a position to make submissions to the Committee which they are able to do under the Trade Practices Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, this kind of thing appears to be infrequent, and the main reason for the observation is that companies are aware of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the existing legislation and the Government’s stated intention to close the loopholes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first point I make is that at this time we should be using our unused drilling resources and, once more, building up our skilled drilling teams in the 3 categories: The shot hole drill, which will go down and pierce, for example, a thin sand film; the diamond drill which will tell us more in detail; and the deep stratigraphic drill which will determine the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of our main basins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it was this unhealthy <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the alliance during the period of the previous Liberal-Country Party Government that affected the very real and basic relationship that exists between the people of the United States of America and the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems completely alien to me and outside the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Minister that he should be refusing to abide by the agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So the Prime Minister is saying: ‘Irrespective of circumstances, irrespective of the changing <span class="highlight">nature</span> of international relations, irrespective of what is transpiring in the Indian Ocean, irrespective of the balance of forces and the opportunities for others to compete for influence- irrespective of those moves- we will turn our back’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is inappropriate for the honourable member for Curtin to say: ‘We cannot get any reply of an urgent <span class="highlight">nature</span> out of the Government’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The background to it is that during the last financial year the previous Minister for Environment made offers under the States Grants (<span class="highlight">Nature</span> Conservation) Act to reimburse the States for the purchase of various tracts of land valued in all at about $9m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason I am able to say that this does not involve any repudiation of agreements is that the original offer was made subject to final agreements being entered into as required by the States Grants <span class="highlight">Nature</span> Conservation Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matter becomes important because of the rather unusual <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Bill before us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have recognised the fragile <span class="highlight">nature</span> of these early signs and the main aim of this Budget is to take those economic measures now which will promote the growth of a slow and steady recovery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Perhaps those persons on a low income who do not drink, smoke, use the telephone, write letters or drive a car may benefit from this application of the consumer pays principle, but for the Government to imagine that such persons are numerous is to misunderstand human <span class="highlight">nature</span> and is bad economics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of the economic advice which the Government received, including that from the Australian Council of Trade Unions, said that incentives were required for both individuals and companies, but the give and take <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Budget has guaranteed that the Budget will not achieve these necessary objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the shortage of time I will not be able to itemise the complete list, but I point out that the Australian Government assists in meeting debt charges and in the fields of State emergency services, universities, colleges of advanced education, technical and further education, schools, pre-schools, child migrant educational research, Medibank, public hospitals, running community health services, television control, school dental health, health education, home dialysis, blood transfusion services, health planning agencies, housekeeping services, home care services, senior citizen’s assistance, assistance to deserted wives, employment grants, regional employment development schemes, social planning units, Aboriginal advancement, housing, area improvement, sewerage, local government, regional organisations, leisure and recreation tourism and, in Perth, the underground railway study and matters of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>, going right through to the natural disaster area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The prime and overriding requirement in an economy of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> is not to put forward facetious and meaningless arguments about the financing of a Budget deficit or the size of the Government sector within which the Budget deficit occurs, but to see that private enterprise works so that that gap can be made up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Given the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the alleged brutality and killing in that territory and given the territory’s immense strategic importance in Australia’s future, especially if the territory becomes a communist state, will the Government not only permit but also co-operate in landing representatives of the Australian media in that territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We in Australia must expect that there Will be a period in which Papua New Guinea will follow the experiences of other colonial or semi-colonial countries in forming friends away from its former colonial master but in time I think it is fair to expect that our relationship with Papua New Guinea will be one of a special <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This afternoon many conservationists, and I am sure all honourable members, were delighted to hear the Minister say that he can go beyond the $1.8m allocation under the terms of the States Grants (<span class="highlight">Nature</span> Conservation) Act to guarantee ahead purchases by the States of certain lands that were not only legally binding but in train to some degree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the time that the States Grants (<span class="highlight">Nature</span> Conservation) Act was introduced into the Parliament I had quite a bit of information prepared but unfortunately did not get a chance to speak in that debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of his work and because he will be campaigning in the next few months, as I understand he has been doing quietly in the past 6 months, I believe that he should be directed in his duties into an area other than the Petrie electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One thing that concerned me greatly in the preparation of the Budget before its presentation was that because we had to resort to a number of measures involving indirect tax charges which could easily be interpreted as an anti-worker or as an anti-wage earner impost, and as we introduced in that Budget the most radical reform of personal taxation for 50 years in itself, on the surface, perhaps seeming to be a complex exercise I believed it absolutely essential that the spokesman on behalf of the trade unions who that night, after the Budget was delivered, would be asked to comment on its <span class="highlight">nature</span> should be fully informed, that he should not have an inadequate appreciation of the strategy of the Budget and its contents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is important, of course, to bear in mind the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Aboriginal land relationship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All this, as I say, only points to the fact that from one end of this Bill to the other we find the problem of whether particular provisions are going to lead to problems with the Aboriginal people themselves, whether they have had the consideration of the non-Aboriginal community, whether they are going to lead to disharmony, or whether we are going to find a situation where a BUI is brought into law which will cause problems, trouble, havoc and increased bureaucracy of a <span class="highlight">nature</span> that was never intended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest also that the purpose of the land councils is not, as the honourable member suggested, to make day to day decisions for the people in the area but to make decisions of a global <span class="highlight">nature</span> as to which group should be recommended to and recognised by the commission as owners of particular land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But to get back to the thing that is really niggling the Opposition at the moment: In the last couple of weeks the mood in the community has changed, if the newspapers- not just the ABC- are any reflection, if one leaves aside the schizophrenic <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the newspapers, where the editorials are taking a line at variance with the news reports and the general commentary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Quite often, the pitfall in legislation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>, which seeks to rationalise the work of two or more bodies engaged in specific tasks of a similar <span class="highlight">nature</span>, is that certain elements tend to be shut out, to lose their identity, in the overall plan of co-ordination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is obvious that it is another decision that has been taken by the Prime Minister without prior notice or consultation and that it is another example of the dictatorial <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Prime Minister causing harm, mainly through economic mismanagement, not only to the employment of Australian people and of businesses throughout Australia but also to our educational institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We can also see from the quotations that the panel expects that the Commission, the councils and their staffs will undertake ‘more comprehensive co-ordinating and management responsibilities  If they persist with management responsibilities I suggest that in the very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of things they will start to conform to one pattern and we will start to get a blurring of the difference between universities and colleges of advanced education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Reports have been filtering through in recent times about the further computerisation of telephone services in the cities, the introduction of push button telephones, of telephone services that will tell the caller when a number is engaged and will ring him back when the number is not engaged so that he may make his call, and things of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that in looking at an organisation like the Australian Broadcasting Commission, if it is possible for certain types of programs to have advertisements without interfering with the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the program, one could well find that this is a means of gaining for that organisation additional revenue that does not come from the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I make the point that the document which I have read out in the House makes allegations of such a serious <span class="highlight">nature</span>- they may or may not be true- that I believe the Government cannot do other than immediately institute a full inquiry into the matter to ascertain whether the allegations are correct or incorrect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These days an adobe house is not just a mud hut with some poor broken down Indian living in it, or something of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>; it has an aesthetic and climatic value, but above all it is economical because the materials are on the spot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The points he made were very simply these: If you do not exclude increases in government charges from indexation, you effectively deprive the Government of the opportunity of increasing taxes of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> except against those areas of society where indexation does not apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I might say that he tested somewhat the normal courtesy of no interjections by the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of his speech, but I shall pass over that in the hope that he will gain knowledge during the very short time he is expected to be in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I ask that Cabinet further consider the proposition that the first $1,000 worth of items of a capital <span class="highlight">nature</span> purchased under this investment allowance provision should attract some consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people who come into the country- the people who embark on a tourist safari of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>- are usually people who are concerned with talking about their trips, not only with coming over for the ordinary pleasures which I suppose are in evidence here and in some respects to an even greater extent in Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I consider it perfectly proper that the Government should involve itself in undertakings of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I simply say that the Commonwealth Budget, by reason of its <span class="highlight">nature</span>, has allowed surpluses to be accumulated and transferred to the States, making the States debtors for the amounts that they have been given in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In point of fact our net overseas indebtedness in total has probably diminished, partly by reason of the Sinking Fund operations and partly by reason of certain private transactions which are not fully documented but the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of which we know something about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There can be a lot of argument about what the Government collects and how it is distributed, but to think that you solve the problem by formulas like the one now proposed by taking a $1 billion debt out of nearly $12 billion as though you have made some great contribution to the problem, shows the essential short-sighted <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that the very wide experience of the right honourable member for Bruce  (Mr Snedden)  and his good humoured <span class="highlight">nature</span> will ensure that he discharges his duties as  Speaker  of this House in a very creditable way and in a way that will reflect great credit not only upon himself but also upon the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the period since it was decided that Geelong would become an area for the promotion of growth based on the need to slow down the concentration of population in one urban area in the State- a proposition which was agreed to both by the State and the Commonwealth governments and which could not have been arrived at without the decision of the State Governmentthere have been some delays, I think unfortunate delays, while the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Geelong Regional <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It seems to me to be axiomatic that when we are considering a program such as the one put forward by the honourable member, involving the expenditure of a great amount of money obtained both from the taxpayer and also from investment by private industry, we should consider the likely results of the anticipated population growth both in extent and <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In any long term development of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>, dependent as it is upon certain assumptions of the size, <span class="highlight">nature</span>, composition of the Australian population in the medium and long term, obviously we must take into consideration the results of detailed investigation, as presented in the Borrie Committee report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 suggest that in considering committees of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> we must attend to several matters if the committees are to work effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One matter that concerns me is how Parliament should follow up reports of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Members of the community- special interest groups, educators and medical people- right throughout the country have a vital concern in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the work being undertaken by the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has looked at the difficulties of remedial teachers, the effectiveness of their programs and whether they are starting to understand the complicated <span class="highlight">nature</span> of a learning difficulty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Parliament may not even know at this point the extent to which the Parliament and the people are in debt to these devoted people because Aboriginal affairs are of such a <span class="highlight">nature</span> that whereas we live with them lightly and easily, the eyes of the world descend on us very heavily and it is an area about which we still have extreme vulnerability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is a matter with which every member of this Parliament ought to be concerned because the work output and the value of the work output, not only of the members but also of the people who work in the building and are more disadvantaged than the members because they have to work here all the time, must be affected by the unsatisfactory <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the building. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are housed in accommodation which is of such a <span class="highlight">nature</span> that anyone who wanted to make any alterations would have to get out the business directory of Australia, go through it from A to Z and get approval from everyone on the list. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am further informed that the provision of these facilities to banks and money market dealers stems from their special positions in the economy including the very detailed legislative or other close supervisions under which they operate and the special <span class="highlight">nature</span> of their activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It may be that the motion to suspend the Standing Orders will not be carried, but at least I put this to the Attorney and I think that professionally he would see the justice of it: Will he table the notarised documents to which he has referred so that honourable members can ascertain the name of the person who swore this false declaration and so that they can see the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the allegations that were made? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the fact is that far more substantive charges or charges of a different <span class="highlight">nature</span> could be made against a member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite possible that charges of a personal <span class="highlight">nature</span> could be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given that the scheme’s objective is to overcome structural imbalances in the labour force, it is far more appropriate to set the allowances on criteria that reflect the labour market <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the program rather than on an irrelevant welfare concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have often heard stories of his forgiving <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would give them a lecture as befits a man of my modest <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I guess they did and with his typical generosity and benign <span class="highlight">nature</span> he would say: ‘Yes, certainly’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was probably his greatest mistake of all and it was conceived, as I said, in generosity, with typical generosity that one would expect from a man of such a benign and forgiving <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The complex <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the present superannuation arrangements has caused many administrative problems and in February, when contributions to the pension scheme and Provident Account were frozen pending the introduction of the new scheme, the work of the Australian Government Retirement Benefits Office was very much in arrears. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The totally arbitrary <span class="highlight">nature</span> of this Government’s approach to cutting back public expenditure should be condemned even by those who misguidedly feel that this is the time for restraint and cut-backs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In conclusion I state that the Treasurer has throughout his statement stressed the central <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the problem of inflation, but the statement contains no strategy to defeat it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They- perhaps I should say we- are only different because they can be directly affected by a bounty or by the cruelty and savagery of <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should be clear to members of this House and the Australian public that the fears expressed regarding possible threats to the autonomous <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the operations of the ABC are without foundation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, it highlights some of the gross omissions in the GovernorGeneral’s Speech and therefore the terribly elitist <span class="highlight">nature</span> of this Government and its program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the Speech by the GovernorGeneral was a vague exercise in the juxtaposition of cliches and generous but hollow sentiments is an indication of this Government’s deception and arrogance, but when one looks at what is not mentioned the really repellent <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the document becomes clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was saying that it is not good enough for the Government to ignore the problems of the world in this forum, this Parliament, and perhaps put too much emphasis on what might be given by way of grants to some institution or something of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a perversion of the very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of representative democracy that the elected representatives of the people can be hamstrung in their task of government by just those men that the people have rejected as potential administrators of the nation ‘s affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the short run a mechanism may appear to direct resources to those in need but in the long run the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the tests applied may be such that they create the very needs that they have sought to relieve, and create them on an even larger scale than they existed before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I recall that some years ago it was a fairly standard joke to talk in the American context about a Ph.D. who had been to one of the second rate institutions in America and had taken out his Ph.D. after 18 months of part-time study, or something of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The variety of points that were covered by him and what he had to say were all of a most constructive <span class="highlight">nature</span> and are points which I am sure will be read with interest by the Minister for Education  (Senator Carrick). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These amendments are of a technical <span class="highlight">nature</span> and are more suitable to be dealt with in the Committee stage of the Bill than at the second reading stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The volume and <span class="highlight">nature</span> of investment in both the public sector and private enterprise are linked with the expected demand for the services of goods to be provided through such investment and the volume and composition of such demand are dependent on the size and composition of the future population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such is the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the penalty, the fine if you like, which social security beneficiaries have to pay because of the curious philosophy of the Prime Minister when he” says that he wants less dependency on government services, he wants a situation which will allow people to retain more of their income so that they can provide more for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last year whilst I was  Speaker  of this House I wrote to both the Opposition Parties and the then Government Party because like the present  Speaker  I was dissatisfied with the manner in which the adjournment debate operated and also the restricted <span class="highlight">nature</span> of only 3 speakers being able to speak for 10 minutes each on the adjournment debate and I asked whether they would agree to accept as a sessional order a 5- minute speaking period on the adjournment debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the discretions available to the Minister administering the Trade Practices Act also emphasises the desirability of the Act being administered by a Minister in one of the great departments of state with a strong tradition of independence, such as the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Contingent upon the termination of this scheme the Commission recommends that the adjustment assistance measures outlined in the separate report on fruit growing reconstruction apply to the apple and pear industry and in particular that area redevelopment authorities be established in the apple and pear growing regions of south-west Western Australia, southern Tasmania and the Stanthorpe region of Queensland and that the feasibility studies necessary to determine the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and extent of these authorities be undertaken as expeditiously as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can think of many others of a secondary and tertiary <span class="highlight">nature</span> which have not adjusted in the way that these agricultural industries, in particular the fruit industry, have, because of union obstructionism, because employees cannot be sacked anyway, or because the industry is protected by very high tariff levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know this question is with the Government at present but in view of the very harsh restrictions now being placed on fruit growers, dairy farmers and other people in Victoria, which make it by definition impossible for an owner operator to obtain unemployment benefits even though he is generally available for work and has had virtually no income, because of the so-called continuing <span class="highlight">nature</span> of his employment he is barred from receiving unemployment benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not the sort of welfare initiative which gets votes but it is the sort of welfare initiatives which satisfies one greatly because one realises that one has discharged a very important moral obligation in society to do something for the very serious social casualties that we do have in our community, and to help the very worthwhile people who dedicate their lives to helping the men and women who are homeless and who are drifting in the community, often in a situation of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> because of some sort of crisis that has occurred in their life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until  1967  the almost exclusively casual <span class="highlight">nature</span> of waterside employment resulted in a situation whereby there was almost a complete absence of the employer-employee relationship which existed in most other industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said, it is a bit hard to understand why the Leader of the Opposition should embark upon an exercise of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> when in fact he was Prime Minister and had 3 years either to hold a public inquiry, if he had such doubts as he expressed the week before last, or to call for the files. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact when that French emperor of whom the Leader of the Opposition is so keen to speak found himself in a situation where he was to be elevated from the position of consul-general or something of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> and to be crowned an emperor, he was rather like the Leader of the Opposition, so fascinated with power that, to the amazement of all present, from the hands of the Pope he grabbed the crown and put it on his own head. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is an extremely technical matter as the context of the 2 speeches made on behalf of the Opposition indicates, but in many respects the system of valuation that is going to be adopted will, by its very <span class="highlight">nature</span>, remove a lot of the doubts and difficulties of construction which formed the basis of the speech of the honourable member for Grayndler. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We all know that commercial transactions can, by various routes and various associations, perhaps wittingly or unwittingly conceal an arrangement or an association between a buyer and a seller, and that the provisions of revenue legislation both at a State and Federal level are directed to revealing the true <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the relationship between the parties to a particular transaction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There would be some genuine problems even if the implementation of this legislation were put off for a further period of 12 months because it is in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of commercial transactions when one changes a system of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> which has operated for so many years that, no matter how much warning one gives and no matter how much time one spends explaining the provisions of the new requirements to those who will be required to comply with them, there are nonetheless during the transitional period understandable teething problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before I describe the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the problem that has come to our notice, let me say that the Government stands firmly and absolutely committed to the retention of Medibank, the continuing support of public hospitals in the States and the free treatment of patients in standard wards, as Medibank and the hospital agreements provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Besides introducing a common aim the Government has also decided that there should be a greater degree of commonality among the 3 Services’ cadet schemes particularly in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Commonwealth assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the burden? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From the time of that visit of mine to Aurukun with people like the legal adviser to the Aurukun community,  Mr Frank  Purcell,  Senator Neville  Bonner and departmental officers, we were aware and very conscious of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the concern of the Aurukun people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So one clear message that has come out of developing experience is that when mining companies and others go in to confer with Aboriginal communities they must first take the time to do their homework and learn the basis of Aboriginal social structure, learn the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of Aboriginal tradition, learn where the lines of authority are within Aboriginal communities, learn who can speak with authority for the Aboriginal people and learn who ought to speak when they are conferring because only if this is done can any adequate consultation be carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The survey conducted in respect of 2 000 or more hospitals in America showed that the mortality was 40 per cent higher in those smaller hospitals of 100 beds or less than it was in public hospitals when balanced in terms of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of illness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose is to undermine completely its credibility, the efficiency with which it has functioned, the comprehensiveness and efficiency with which it has given universal coverage and the equity of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Medibank concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the coercion injected here and the Government is dishonourable and dishonest for wanting to do this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The dishonourable <span class="highlight">nature</span> of this whole exercise is that the Government does not give a damn about the way in which people meet the cost of health services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The instruction issued by my Department on 10 July, 1975 (and clarified in a further instruction dated 1 1 July, 1975) was in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of a reminder that precautions should not be relaxed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To ensure that the children’s welfare is safeguarded, the Minister for Social Security has requested that child welfare authorities continue to refer for attention, matters of an unusual <span class="highlight">nature</span> or where malpractices occur, and has asked to be kept informed on a regular basis of the number of children in their State or Territory who are known to come within the provisions of that Act or are exempted therefrom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I just remind him that the Minister has always had the right to intervene in the public interest in matters before a full bench under section 3 1, that is, the section relating to standard hours of work and wage claims based on national economic grounds, long service leave and things of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> and also under section 34 dealing with references and section 35 dealing with appeals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a simple reason for this- a reason not linked just to the amount of industry and the size of the city but a reason which is based on the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Sydney basin itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am delighted that the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street)  is willing to consider the substance of the amendment and to consider the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of this clause and the argument proposed in support of my amendment when an amendment to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is to be introduced into this chamber later this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have said before, this is an extremely comprehensive report and it is quite impossible to deal with every aspect of it in a short speech of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are going back to the old system of private health insurance which means it will be more expensive for individuals in the community to cover themselves with private insurance because of the inefficient <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the private health insurance system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fifth point I made was that the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the means test distorts investment by inducing people to prefer ‘exempt’ assets and thus to undertake wasteful expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Tariffs are a matter of vital importance to us; so much so that recently it was necessary for certain action of a protective <span class="highlight">nature</span> to be taken in respect of imports of black sheet steel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Corporation also has categories of investment which will be eligible for insurance which are in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of non-commercial risks against which investors overseas should be insured- such as warlike acts, confiscation, imposition of trade restrictions and buyer insolvency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But of course what needs to be said in a debate of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> is that the Liberal-National Country Party Government believes in home ownership for Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Accordingly, having regard to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of this petition it is felt that there is some obligation to make available publicly documents that are tabled in the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is another matter which I think is important, and that is that the character and <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the documents themselves have no greater validity, or indeed less validity, than they have at the moment of tabling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest, with very great respect, that what the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith has said does misconceive the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and the effect of the motion before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I first state the very general principle as to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and extent of any particular privilege claimed by Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 8 of the Crimes (Internationally Protected Persons) Bill implements the obligation that Australia will accept under article 2 of the Convention to make the intentional commission of the offences described in that article crimes punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account their grave <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thereby it becomes an indictable offence because of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the imprisonment, the indictable offence being applicable because of section 42 of the Acts Interpretation Act which provides for offences punishable by imprisonment for a period exceeding 6 months to be indictable unless the contrary intention appears. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I can envisage other cases involving dangerous goods that would not be subject to his discretion; in other words, because of the horrendous <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the matter he would think that it was a proper case to go before a judge and jury, or a judge for sentence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must confess that I have a great deal of sensitivity in response to the suggestion of the honourable member for Hunter  (Mr James)  that the sentence attached to a crime under the Act- 7 years- seems to be quite inadequate in terms of the horrendous <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the crimes that people are inclined to perpetrate from time to time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The main differences between this Bill and that presented last October by the previous Government are, briefly, that: We have clearly defined the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Aboriginal land rights we are recognising by vesting title in trusts for the benefit of all those Aborigines with traditional rights to use and occupy that land- 1 might add, a fundamental provision strangely missing in the Labor Government’s Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, we must be prepared to recognise that progress will be difficult, due partly to the entrenched <span class="highlight">nature</span> of domestic policies in many countries and partly to disagreement between the two main participants in the negotiations-the United States and the EC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-54-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia, because of its very <span class="highlight">nature</span>, because of its remote and far flung population, relies to a very great degree on an effective, efficient communications system and these new provisions will provide such a system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This committee was given the task of investigating and reporting to the Government on the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and condition of the National Estate and the ways in which all bodies in Australia, both government and non-government, could work together to preserve and enhance it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During that time, in both the Parliament and the countryside I expressed our wish to preserve for posterity those things that were created by man and <span class="highlight">nature</span> and that are unique and beautiful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Committee was asked to view the National Estate as comprising such things as national parks, <span class="highlight">nature</span> reserves, historic buildings and structure of architectural merit, areas of special scientific interest, the coastline, inland waters, our wetlands and urban parks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was in 1973 that Australia established a committee of inquiry to ascertain the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and state of the National Estate and the role which the Australian government could play in the preservation and enhancement of the National Estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the legislation, its purpose and intent demand a total commitment from this Government to the protection, maintenance and preservation of our National Estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The broad <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Committee structure was a tremendously significant factor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Department of the Environment’s program on grants to conservation bodies, amounting to $448,000 was a recommendation of the Interim Committee as was the program of the Department of the Environment for acquisition of land for <span class="highlight">nature</span> conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have written to the Victorian Minister saying that I am unable to accept this proposition that funds of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> ought to be made available, on top of the $3 8m, for urban arterial roads, and that too ought to go to local roads. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When economic conditions permit and when funds are again appropriated for new urgent projects under the National Estate program the Government will be looking to the Heritage Commission for advice on priorities and needs, including those of a financial <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Government’s attitude to the size of the Commission and its <span class="highlight">nature</span> shows a basic lack of understanding of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and type of problems faced in preserving our heritage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, probably the most important reason why the size of the Heritage Commission should be left at that proposed in the original Act is that the Commission, by its very <span class="highlight">nature</span> needs to have representatives of all interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In practice, because of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of their business, in most courts these applications were not usually heard until the end of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The simple facts are firstly, that the contractionary <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Budget will lead to vast unemployment because of the fall in aggregate demand, especially through a decline in consumer, government and business spending; and, secondly, that the whole rationale of the economic package does not attack the basic ills of the economy- that is, the structural imbalance caused by elements such as obsolescence, protection and multinational corporate activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact remains that even in areas where employers cannot resist over-award claims- because of the borderline <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the operation, under capacity and a shortage of skilled workforce- the impact of the general level of wages is such that in some other area of employment someone else is retrenched or is not replaced on leaving his employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the depressing conclusion that one would come to with regard to the field of technical education was that the States of New South Wales and Victoriatremendously important States- were using Commonwealth grants of a capital <span class="highlight">nature</span> for technical education as a substitute for and not additional to their own expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What the Government has set about to do is to appraise Aboriginal programs, to look at the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of housing programs that have been developed, to look at the jobs that have been provided in the form of special work programs, particularly in Aboriginal areas, and to assess whether they are really the sorts of programs that are wanted or required and to assess whether they are the programs that the people themselves, given a choice and not believing that they are doing what we want them to do, would themselves accept and want and pursue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless they develop aims that extend to individual unity of character, to co-operative relations with other workers and with <span class="highlight">nature</span>, as well as to control and responsibility in the operation of the system of production, or to that aim that is usually called socialism, workers remain firmly within the capitalist hegemony and within power of the capitalist ruling class. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, it would be a higher priority to spend money on school dental health services and on the development of community health services- a whole range of community health and welfare services and other areas of responsibility of public office- rather than plugging benefits into a system which will just incite more utilisation because of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the fee for service system and the sort of benefits that can be derived from that system because of the absence of adequate restraint on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a simple amendment, designed to provide flexibility in programs developed with the States for <span class="highlight">nature</span> conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has a clear policy to work through the Council of <span class="highlight">Nature</span> Conservation Ministers in the development of cooperative programs for the conservation and management of Australia ‘s wildlife. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report of the select committee which was established under a Liberal-Country Party Government in May 1 970, is a landmark in Commonwealth Government policies for the protection of Australia’s unique fauna and flora; it set the pattern and provided guidelines for much of the future legislation for <span class="highlight">nature</span> conservation in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 1974 the Parliament legislated to make it possible for the Commonwealth to provide financial assistance to the States for purposes connected with <span class="highlight">nature</span> conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Act makes provision for the Minister to agree with an appropriate Minister of a State upon programs of land acquisition for <span class="highlight">nature</span> conservation and for payments of financial assistance to be made to the States in accordance with the approved programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This extension of the Commonwealth’s role in <span class="highlight">nature</span> conservation, from land acquisition to management activities, is in response to a general view expressed among the States that the acquisition of land in itself is only the first step towards creating secure areas where flora and fauna can be protected and preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An equally important activity is the management of these areas and this has led the Government to decide on an amendment to the Act so that the States can be given flexibility within an overall program of financial assistance for <span class="highlight">nature</span> conservation to determine in consultation with the Commonwealth where the priority needs lie in the particular circumstances of their own State responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My point is that as a capital exporter as well as a capital importer- I stress that I am not talking about the present currency situation- eventually there would not be the same net inflow holding up the Australian dollar, so the long term tendency for an otherwise high Australian dollar would, in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of things, be contained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of that judgment is set out in sufficiently wide terms in clause 8 to enable the High Court to express its judgment in any form which is appropriate to a particular case before it It is not a rigid situation and it is not a matter of saying that what prevails in Australia is necessarily appropriate for Nauru. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If some of the information sought is of a confidential <span class="highlight">nature</span>, is it not a fact that facilities are provided under the procedures laid down in the Act to ensure that this confidence is respected but that does not mean that the information should be withheld from the hearing commissioners? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendment to the States Grants (<span class="highlight">Nature</span> Conservation) Act 1974 contained in this Bill while simple could in the hands of a committed government ensure the protection of many of our endangered species and our threatened wilderness areas and provide much needed recreational and national parks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is under attack because of this Government’s desire for uncontrolled growth- growth in migration, growth in mining, growth in woodchip and wood pulping, and growth in the lack of awareness of people who little understand the delicate <span class="highlight">nature</span> and fabric of our environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is further seen in the Government’s stated intention to give the States the administration of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) legislation, its lack of commitment to the built environment, its refusal to fund <span class="highlight">nature</span> conservation organisations on a non-matching grants basis if funded at all and its abolition of the public environment awareness program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A further illustration of this Government’s lack of commitment to the protection of the environment concerns the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of their grants to conservation organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By making grants of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>, the Labor Government sought to establish a permanent and growing network of action and information groups capable of influencing governmental and commercial impacts on the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From a technical point of view, the amendments which allow the Australian Government’s role in <span class="highlight">nature</span> conservation to extend from mere land acquisition assistance to the States to co-operation in management activities should be supported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In essence it provides that, in addition to land acquisition, the Commonwealth can agree with a State on programs of management and the provision of facilities in parks and reserves in connection with <span class="highlight">nature</span> conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a State decides that it has adequate tracts of land set aside for <span class="highlight">nature</span> conservation purposes, it can select its priority by saying to the Commonwealth that it wishes to apportion its share of the Commonwealth funds to the management and control of those parks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  stated in his second reading speech, in 1974 the Parliament legislated to make it possible for the Commonwealth to provide financial assistance to the States for purposes connected with <span class="highlight">nature</span> conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>(1) Where a cause pending in a federal court other than the High Court or in a court of a State or Territory relates to a matter arising under the Constitution, or in a cause pending in any such court a question of interpretation of the Constitution is involved or arises, it is the duty of the court not to proceed in the cause unless and until the court is satisfied that notice of the cause, specifying the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the matter or question, has been given by a party to the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth and to the Attorney-General of each State and a reasonable time has elapsed since the giving of the notice for consideration by those Attorneys-General of the question of intervention in the proceedings or removal of the case to the High Court “(2) For the purposes of sub-section ( 1 ), a court in which a cause referred to in that sub-section is pending- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If senior advisers and servants of this Commonwealth, whether they be civilians or members of the armed forces, are to take to the Press and attack politicians on one side or the other, the apolitical <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Public Service comes to be broken down and destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there is to be a 2-airline agreement and if there is to be disputation that requires negotiation between the union concerned and the 2 airlines, surely those negotiations, because of the very narrow <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the industry, ought to be on a bilateral basis, that is, both TAA and Ansett should continue the negotiations together without one taking advantage of the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The oil companies are not without problems and we should not forget the right of the consumers of petroleum products in Australia to have a certain level of price flexibility which is consistent with” a competitive arrangement in a market of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am led to understand that requests for the collection of evidence of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> for foreign tribunals would be regulated by the practices and procedures of relevant State courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The General would know that if the Crown presents an indictment against a person charged with some offence and within the Crown case conflicts of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> arise, any counsel worth his salt will be on his feet saying to the judge: ‘I ask your Honour to take a certain course- to direct the Crown prosecutor to return the indictment and to enter a nolle prosequi’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, whilst many of the objectives of legislation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> are objectives that the Government shares in common with the views expressed by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith and whilst the Government is committed to greater uniformity in this area and a greater involvement by the Commonwealth Government, for the reasons I have outlined the approach at this time by the Opposition is fundamentally at odds with the approach that the Government has adopted to this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is, I think, sufficient to say that clause 8 of the Bill creates in Australia offences that give effect to Article IV of the Convention and provides penalties that take into account the grave <span class="highlight">nature</span> of those offences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I recall that in an earlier debate of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> this year the Minister made the point that the amount being provided for national highways was much greater on a percentage basis than was being provided for other categories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The new pattern of management of the exchange rate will enable more frequent, more timely and smaller adjustments to be made to the rate; is appropriate to the changing <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the world economy and to Australia’s international trade relationship; is designed to avoid the build-up of an expectation of major changes at long intervals in the future; will permit the use of the exchange rate as appropriate, as a more flexible arm of economic policy; and will require little or no institutional changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There can be no certainty that further changes in the excess distribution provisions would, given the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the situations to be dealt with and the quite bewildering complexity of this area of the law, hold out any greater assurance of success than the amendments made as recently as 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, if we have to decide a new formula, introduce subsidiary legislation or something of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> to bring about a different deal in relation to mining rights, we should not allow the renewal of leases to continue in their present form because I believe it offends the spirit of the legislation and it will make absolutely certain that there are large parts of the Northern Territory on Aboriginal domain which will never belong to the Aboriginal in the strict sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendment which the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)  has moved is implicit in the legislation because, from their very <span class="highlight">nature</span>, identification and mapping of such sites would not be done in breach of Aboriginal usage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apart from the possibility that a provision of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> could lead to some commercial operators applying pressure on the Government to make assistance available to alleviate financial difficulties resulting from their own commercial practices, the inclusion of such section in the Act does not, in reality, provide the Minister with any additional powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the public service <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the ABC it was very difficult for people with talent to progress within that organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Too much is left unsaid by this legislation for us to know the exact <span class="highlight">nature</span> of this relationship, but the portents seem ominous for the ABC and, thereafter, ethnic broadcasting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think this is a reasonable proposition and, if companies want to take advantage of the deduction, they would need to re-arrange the articles of association and the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the company so as to maximise the benefit of the available deductions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The problem of this across-the-board measure was very much the result of a series of across-the-board measures taken by the Labor Government- upward valuations, across-the-board expenditure, inflation which had an across-the-board effect and tariff cuts which were of an across-the-board <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government does not accept an amendment of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>, very clearly any advocacy its members have for worker participation and worker involvement is just a bad joke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe even the honourable member for Maribyrnong would take comfort from the fact that when public confrontation of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> occurs there can no longer be any doubt that this Government will not seek to interfere politically with the ABC and will not seek to impose its will upon the ABC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Public broadcasting has a specific role and therefore the provisions in the Bill to provide services for people within a specified area, to provide programs of a specified <span class="highlight">nature</span> and a specified purpose, are essential to the thrust of the Government’s policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the reasons for the new system is to obviate speculation which, as the honourable gentleman ought well to understand, can build up where there are long periods in which there is no movement of the exchange rate, as has been the case in recent years since September 1974 and as was the case specifically during the course of recent months when there was major speculation as to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the move itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I should emphasise that, while the discussion paper outlines proposals for a scheme, the Government is not committed to these proposals, as it believes that final decisions on the detailed <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the scheme should not be taken until all areas of government, interested business and community groups and the public generally have been given every opportunity to make their views known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am led to understand that requests for the collection of evidence of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> for foreign tribunals would be regulated by the practices and procedures of relevant State courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some concern will exist in certain sections with regard to penalties, the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of notice and particularly the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the exercise of the power in respect of these proceedings in an orderly marketing situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is not opposed to the principle of orderly marketing but it is opposed, perhaps, to the suggestion that the Attorney-General, irrespective of his merits or otherwise, can be given powers of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that a great many members on this side of the House would regard that litigation and the extent to which evidence was able to be produced as a result of letters of request issued to Australian domestic courts as very beneficial to world commerce and in breaking up of cartels of an objectionable <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Australian Housing Corporation and the innovative programs it was going to administer in every area of housing made accountability and analysis mandatory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I think I should remind the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition that the purpose of this Bill is to reconstitute the Australian Housing Corporation in accordance with the Government’s announced policy and to change its name, <span class="highlight">nature</span> and function so that its sole responsibility will be the administration of the defence service homes scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would suggest that temporary assistance, which by its very <span class="highlight">nature</span> means urgent assistance, is not readily obtainable if an organisation has to wait for something Uke 8 months for a decision to be made on whether a reference to the Authority will be made in the first place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Mr Speaker, I want to submit to you that the explanation given is not satisfactory to the House in the sense that you have omitted to advise the Parliament that it is the responsibility and duty of the Attorney-General to certify in each case where legislation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> is submitted to the Governor-General that he has carefully perused the enactment and that it is in accordance with the legislation that passed both Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I gave the honourable gentleman the right to speak because of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the issue, but he knows that he has now gone beyond reasonable indulgence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one makes some short sharp comparisons between what happened during the Labor years and what has happened over the past 12 months one begins to see the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the turnaround that has occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#subdebate-13-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was left wondering, after having spent some hours in the area, just why it is that we need something like a disaster of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> to bring us together and to cause us to exhibit those qualities that we know Australians have but which all too often we seem to lose sight of in other than emergency situations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Given their experience and temperament, and given their human <span class="highlight">nature</span>, they are far more likely to prefer one of their own circle than an unknown from outside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All future governments will know that appointments of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> will not necessarily continue beyond that government’s period in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is regrettable that the actions of the previous Government made legislation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is nonetheless appropriate that the ground rules for these appointments be added to the statutes so that from this time on governments will act in the full knowledge of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and the extent of their actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that an occasion would arise when a person who is appointed to a position of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> referred to in the Bill may not have his term extended, even by the government which appointed him, because if the life of the government extends beyond the 5-year period of his appointment and his appointment is up for renewal, it may not be renewed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these people are interested in a career structure, they must consider whether the position which they are being offered is of a sheer political <span class="highlight">nature</span> or whether their special talent and expertise are being recognised and they are being called upon by a government to perform a duty in the administration of government in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My principal objection is the incestuous <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Bill where the Public Service is allowed to self perpetuate itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The thing that puzzles me about debates of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>, and particularly the arguments that emanate from the other side of the House, is the obsession with ‘single authorities’ such as permanent heads, prime ministers and public service boards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first part concerns the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the answer by the Treasurer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the introduction in 1949 of proportional representation dramatically changed the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of political representation in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members recall, some of those referenda were of a <span class="highlight">nature</span> that clearly no government of our political persuasion could agree to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An understanding of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the petroleum industry and the policies which are required to bring about the cheapest possible delivery of petrol to the Australian consumers are not assisted by extravagant rhetoric of the type indulged in by the honourable member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances it was possible for somebody to appoint to the Public Service in the highest policy advising areas, people with a deep political and philosophical commitment which would destroy the apolitical <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable gentlemen would know, the Government has introduced legislation designed to make that impossible in order to preserve the apolitical <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Public Service, but at the same time to make it possible for someone outside the Public Service to be properly appointed to a position on a contract basis for a particular period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that blends in a system which maintains the apolitical <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Public Service but at the same time makes it possible to attract outside expertise to the highest positions in the Public Service, if a particular government so wishes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: As these allegations are of a very serious <span class="highlight">nature</span> and seem to involve millions of dollars of public funds, will he assure the House that the final report of the working party examining pathology services, due I trunk in December last, will be tabled in this House? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is noticeable about the debate is the half-hearted <span class="highlight">nature</span> with which the Opposition has approached the subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the opinion of the Opposition that there is no justification for writing into the Trade Practices Act provisions which, by their very <span class="highlight">nature</span>, will cause more problems than they solve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally we should note our belief that many but not all of the costs to which we have been referred have been costs of a ‘once only’ <span class="highlight">nature</span>- usually legal and professional costsassociated with the process of becoming familiar with the legislation and ordering affairs to fit with its rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point here, if ore relates that back to what the Trade Practices Commission said about the long term <span class="highlight">nature</span> of this operation, is of course, that, there may be immediate complaint about the companies adjusting to authorities like the Trade Practices Commission, the Prices Justification Tribunal or the Industries Assistance Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an impossible task to set up an authority like the Trade Practices Commission and expect that the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of its operation will be as cheap- if we want to use that term- or that the costs will be as little in its immediate term of operation as they will be in the years hence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the trade practices legislation has to reflect the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and structure of the Australian economy and the repeal of section 49 has to be looked at in that light. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is anomalous that the Trade Practices Act should apply to private enterprise and not to government enterprise of a commercial <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They cannot understand how the Government’s priorities are so low that it has to take this action in order to sell some S000 extra tonnes of beef or something of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>work that was done under previous schemes and insinuates that work done was of a make-work rather than of a productive <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Minister’s statement of the works in previous schemes being of a mundane <span class="highlight">nature</span> should be refuted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the dramatic boom in unemployment commenced in September 1974 nothing of any substantial <span class="highlight">nature</span> was really done to assist the offices to carry out their functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable member is suggesting that there should be a situation in which an important area of activity, such as industrial relations, is largely conducted outside any law or outside the capacity to apply any law then he is saying something very serious about the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of that society, and that is something that ought to be of concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that the Minister of course indicated that there might be some difficulties in relation to underdeveloped countries and matters of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At least a body of legal opinion believes that proposed section 45D could in fact be used as a major punitive clause against a union taking legitimate actionaction which any person other than a person who is totally devoid of a sense of responsibility would accept that the union is entitled to takeand could result in a suit of prosecution of a <span class="highlight">nature</span> which would make it impossible for small unions, and there are small unions, to operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That should be a paramount principle in the sort of philosophy that stands behind legislation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> and that is what we are seeking to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point that I wish to make is that the industrial work force has enough to contend with as the present capitalist system continues on its inevitable path of squeezing the work force in its quest for profits without being subjected to deliberately provocative legislation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If you believe that is the way to get the economy going you are making a very sad mistake, and you will not succeed in improving labour conditions in this country by introducing legislation of a coercive and snide <span class="highlight">nature</span> such as that contained in proposed new section  45D  of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We on this side would support any action taken by the Government which does something of a positive <span class="highlight">nature</span> for the youth of this nation, because we believe that if there is one section of the Australian community now suffering from the present economic constraints imposed by the Fraser Government it is the young people of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With that, all foreign policy in fact has been atomic policy, because it has been the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and the possession of the new weapons which have determined the course of history and the way in which the greater nations could act in order to further what they thought were their own interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last year, as I mentioned in my speech in the second reading debate on legislation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> in that year, the Tasmanian Government made an offer to the Minister for Primary Industry to extend cover additional to the stabilisation scheme to 340 000 boxes on a dollar for dollar basis with the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has become apparent that the posturing and positioning that needs to take place in the Labor Party to have the necessary effect of raising support among Caucus members is such that there have to be debates of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> to allow the candidates the opportunity to expose themselves before their colleagues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But, and this is the point I started from, the achievement of this is, in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the case, a long haul as business investmentwitness the figures I referred to earlierand the general level of productivity rise to accommodate the presently too high level of costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my opinion it is a very serious matter that an officer, no matter in what circumstances, can place his Minister in a position which could be untenable- this would have been the situation had the then Minister continued in his position throughout the hearings of this inquiry- when it is found that evidence of a damaging <span class="highlight">nature</span> given is incorrect and that fact is not immediately the subject of a report to the Parliament by the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is found on subsequent examination or admission that statements of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> are incorrect I believe a report to the Parliament by the Committee indicating that incorrect statements, deliberately or otherwise, have been given to the Committee about a member of Parliament should be made even though the investigation is continuing because it is important that where incorrect statements are made deliberately or otherwise- I do not make any accusations in that area- the Parliament should be advised as soon as possible after that fact becomes apparent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having regard to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the work required to be undertaken, the related skills of the 2 staffs and the general scarcity of those skills and the high administrative cost of maintaining separate bodies, the Government concluded that the resources of the 2 Bureaus should be amalgamated to form a strong integrated transport research body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The debate has been of a non-partisan <span class="highlight">nature</span> since it is evident that there is a very strong inclination to have regard to the need for Australia to make a contribution to the developing countries in our region particularly, but in other parts of the world as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But is should be borne in mind that, as the report suggested, when we have economic problems as we do at the moment- they are not of a serious <span class="highlight">nature</span>- we must give money in an organised manner and it must be money that we can afford without placing great burdens and strains on the Australian taxpayer and without taking funds from other sections of the Australian community where money is needed also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a lawyer one might have hoped to amend this piece of legislation to ensure that the Australian people could express an opinion on any number of matters that the Government may from time to time decide; for example, the mining of uranium and matters of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> could well have been encompassed in what might be called a general purpose provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been suggested that it is wrong to interfere with the freedom of individual Australians, that perhaps we should not prevent them from engaging in activities overseas, that it would be contrary to their individual rights, but if we consider the question we realise that we are talking about the right to engage in hostile activities of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> described. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The all-embracing <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Bill would also make it an offence for Australians to send messages of support to oppressed people who were retaliating against tyrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other characteristic which underlies this Bill is that it must be of a political <span class="highlight">nature</span>, having regard to political effects in respect of Australians in overseas countries and in respect of the governments of overseas countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless, the principal reason why the amendment ought to be rejected remain its absolute inflexibility, the absurdity of the situation with respect to the judgments which he is going to impose on Australians overseas when they engage in a very wide set of activities, for or against a government, of a military or a paramilitary <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Lilley  (Mr Kevin Cairns),  before the suspension of the sitting, as I understood what he said in the short time that he addressed the Committee, spoke in terms of what would happen if some armed force outside Australia, some recognised army of another country, were to seek people to serve that army perhaps in the capacity of programming computers, or something of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Antony Whitlam)  put forward a very sound proposition, I thought, as to why this clause dealing with an instrument signed by the Attorney-General and published in the  Gazette  should be amended so that it was in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of a regulation and would need to lie on the table in this chamber so that the Parliament could be involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the highly technical <span class="highlight">nature</span> of life insurance and the effect any amendments to the Act are likely to have on the industry and policy owners, the amendments effected by this Bill have been developed in close consultation with the life insurance industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So it seems to me that those who would hector and lecture ought to reflect on not merely their own inadequacies but the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and the delinquency in the administration and <span class="highlight">nature</span> of aid programs when they were in power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, underlying it all, what is really the test is not the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the administration of aid programs, nor indeed the percentage of gross national product- - people can have a fixation about both amounts and percentages- but the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of those programs whether they are relevant to the needs of the people to whom they are supposedly applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On a small point of a technical <span class="highlight">nature</span> let me say that during that debate the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Uren)  made the assertion that the only thing that the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development has done in a public debate in this Parliament has been to reintroduce on the notice paper the uranium debate, that it has been put back on the notice paper only because of the matter of public importance submitted by the Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matter of bounty versus tariff, highlighted by the honourable member for Wakefield  (Mr Kelly),  is noteworthy as it places fairly and squarely, in identifiable form, the responsibility and the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of this expenditure inasmuch as it is linked directly and immediately with the continued employment of, in this case, 1600 Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The situation may be summed up by saying that the difficulties of this industry depend upon the overwhelming truism and simple fact that it cannot run an unfunded scheme and that the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the funding of that scheme lies at the heart of what one considers in relation to any insurance industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is correct to pursue a policy where such investments are long dated because the liabilities of the offices are of a long term <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whilst the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Australian capital market precludes switching of the large amounts of stocks already held there is no reason why an office, when subscribing to a new government loan, should not restrict itself to the short end if it thinks those rates will rise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So, while indices provide a useful guide in assessing whether the basis is up to date, it is necessary in view of the long-term <span class="highlight">nature</span> of life insurance that liabilities are valued conservatively, thus ensuring stability of the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point that worries me, apart from the fact that the guidelines really are beginning to overthrow the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the commission system, is the eclipsing of the Technical and Further Education Commission when it had existed for only 2 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Tertiary Education Commission represents a major advance on earlier proposals for 3 main reasons: Firstly, it will include the important area of technical and further education; secondly, it recognises the distinct <span class="highlight">nature</span> and status of each of the 3 post-school sectors; and thirdly, it obliges the Commission to consult with appropriate State authorities in the performance of its functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important for the future quality of education that those essentially distinctive and authentic characteristics of the various types of tertiary institutions should be preserved and developed, while recognising that the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of individual units will change and evolve and the need for new-type institutions will emerge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my second reading speech in 1974, as the then Minister for Housing and Construction, I mentioned that this program was of a temporary <span class="highlight">nature</span> while a survey of pensioners was made by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point I make is that both the report of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty and the 1974 aged persons housing survey establish that the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of occupancy is central to determining the extent of poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that others- I will not use the description for which I was called to order a moment agowill not again use the pensioners of this country as a means by which to stir up political propaganda of a cheap and unworthy <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The freeze in New Zealand was of a different <span class="highlight">nature</span> to the one that was proposed recently in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian people overwhelmingly support the proposals for a prices and wages freeze of a temporary <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Mr Deputy Speaker, my grievance today concerns the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and content of the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act and the way in which that Act is administered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It relates both to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the legislation itself and to the way in which it is administered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that it has always been the view of his Government and the Government Parties that democratic opposition must operate within the parliamentary forum in the proper democratic manner, that his Government does not believe that politics ought to be taken to the streets, as do quite a number of people on the Opposition benches of the House and as they practised on a previous occasion, and that the Government believes very strongly that the proper democratic forum- that is, the election of people at elections- is the way in which to see who ought to govern and the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the opposition itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The opportunity has also been taken to make some other amendments of a minor <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other amendments are either of a minor <span class="highlight">nature</span>, merely procedural or of a consequential <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reasoning behind them will no longer be available to the Australian community and Government decisions will again take on the cloak of all wisdom because any criticism of an authoritative <span class="highlight">nature</span> will not be available for the public to examine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of these programs are either of a long-term continuing <span class="highlight">nature</span> or are caught on the indexation bandwaggon with an automatically inbuilt capacity to involve successively higher outlays each year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to make 2 comments in this regard: Firstly, given the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the expenditure side of the Budget to which I have already referred, any tax reductions above those already made would inevitably lead to an increased deficit and the kind of inflation and increased pressure on interest rates that Australia has experienced over the past few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So too would a decision in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of a test case made at a lower level of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Instructors and lecturers need to understand thoroughly their subject and the objectives and <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the trade union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am aware of the immense significance that a strike of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> could have to Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government introduces industrial legislation of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> there will be a confrontation with the trade union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister’s action in seeking a meeting, and the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the discussions he had, can be explained only on the assumption that he was confident about the future course of Australian political events. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-21-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition feels the majority position would have been a better one and, while it is not at this stage indicating the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the amendments proposed, I foreshadow them by saying that the Opposition would rather the Bill be as it was proposed to be drawn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There should be no suggestion that a person under restraint is in fact in any way subject to imprisonment of any <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, in view of the grave <span class="highlight">nature</span> of these allegations, will the Prime Minister ascertain whether any money originating from the CIA has been received by his Party in the past 10 years and make that information available to the Parliament as a matter of urgency? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770504_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the question which I allowed to proceed I also allowed the Prime Minister, at his wish, to answer it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770504_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought it was apparent from the very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the proposal in the first instance that the situation he alleges came within the province of the freeze obviously could not do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770504_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suggestions that the rise in share prices since 13 April constitutes a breach of the freeze result from a total misapprehension by the honourable gentleman as to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the proposal in the first place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770504_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my view one of the most alarming events of recent times has been the number of documents of a high security <span class="highlight">nature</span>, which are supposedly in the hands of very few people, which nave been appearing in newspapers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770504_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the ACTU resolution and the wealth that it would provide in the hands of a significant number of trade union leaders make it all the more imperative that rank and file members of the trade union movement have an understanding of the way in which their money is in fact being spent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>that these papers were of a highly confidential <span class="highlight">nature</span> pertaining to  Mr Whitlam  ‘s political career. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It having been suggested by  Mr Combe  in this interview that these papers were of a highly confidential <span class="highlight">nature</span> pertaining to  Mr Whitlam  ‘s political career, we read on and find, later in the interview, as reported by the detective that  Mr Combe  said that the papers were of no significance or no importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When asked if he could be more explicit as to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the papers which were stolen, he then stated that at this stage, he could not answer that because he did not know if, in fact any papers had been stolen or mislaid at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further, if honourable members examine the questions without notice that I have asked, they will find that they are of a <span class="highlight">nature</span> that certainly does not require any assistance from any public servant or other person, nor do they refer to material pertinent to the Attorney-General’s Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am aware of the concern expressed by certain beef producers as a result of imports of beef from New Zealand and in view of the sensitive <span class="highlight">nature</span> of this trade, officers from my Department and the Department of Primary Industry maintain a watch on imports of beef from New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-43-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true that changes have been made and that in legislation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>, as the honourable member for Grayndler and the honourable member for Port Adelaide know, it is necessary that changes, many of them of a technical <span class="highlight">nature</span>, be made right up until the Bill goes into its final stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Obviously, because of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of this statute there will be argument throughout this entire debate and argument even after the debate is concluded, no matter whether it is concluded tonight or in 6 months time, as to what the Act in its amended form in certain areas means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding the arguments which the honourable member for Corio has put, I do not believe that the change in this area is of such a <span class="highlight">nature</span> that it is not possible to form a view as to whether one supports or opposes the change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme of the Act, if I need to go over it again, is to set out general prohibitions and then to charge the Commission with the administration of that law; to develop guidelines in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of a dynamic economy and new concepts as they emerge, and to have regard to the particular concerns of markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nonetheless, in terms of the laying down of guidelines that might influence the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Commission’s recommendations, I believe that one can still draw an analogy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about the Trade Practices Tribunal, which earlier tonight the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs  (Mr Howard)  conceded is a tribunal of a semi-judicial <span class="highlight">nature</span>, and yet here we have important questions such as the suspension and removal of members of the Tribunal and the staff of the Tribunal, and particularly the question of who conducts the registries of the Tribunal, being taken away from the First Law Officer of Australia and vested in the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To use an example which will be well known to Opposition members who are participating in this debate, the effect of this clause will be that in considering, say, the anti-competitive effect of an agreement between oil company A and a petrol re-seller the Commission will be able to pay regard to the effects of other agreements of a like <span class="highlight">nature</span> between the same oil company and other petrol resellers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The view which has been expressed very strongly by quite a cross-section of practitioners in this area is that if we did not have an aggregation clause of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> it could be virtually impossible in certain circumstances for the Commission to find that a particular agreement had an anti-competitive effect, unless it were possible for the Commission to assess the anticompetitive effect of that agreement against the background of assessing the totality of the anticompetitive effect of similar agreements to which the same company is also a party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very disappointed that he should speak in such a disparaging fashion about one of <span class="highlight">nature</span>’s gentlemen, that is,  Mr George  Apap, the Secretary of the Storemen and Packers Union in his own State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that no argument that I will be able to adduce in the few moments I intend to take tonight will be sufficient to persuade any member of the Opposition that it is appropriate to include a clause of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> in a trade practices Bill, or indeed that this provision is other than a deliberate attempt by the Government to discriminate against the trade union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member made the very valid point that, if the Government wishes to confer an advantage of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> on small business, then as far as possible that advantage should be equally available throughout Australia and the drawing up of the provision should not be such as to provide for an advantage being more readily available in, say, Sydney than in Perth or Hobart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, the arguments put forward in the Swanson Committee report as to the satisfactory <span class="highlight">nature</span> or otherwise of the existing merger provisions were not found to be attractive by the Trade Practices Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they elect to carry on in business entering into contracts of chattel hiring instead of attending to the area of money-lending and contracts of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>, secured by chattel mortgages, then their legal rights will be judged by the terms of the agreements they enter into and by the contract law applicable to contracts of that form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An appreciation of the extent and <span class="highlight">nature</span> of developments affecting Australian livestock producers is essential to a full understanding of the changes to composition, functions and powers of the Australian Meat Board which are provided for in the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Bill 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For this reason, and also because of the demanding and arduous <span class="highlight">nature</span> of at least some of the disputes- notably, defended custody disputes- there seems to be good reason for requiring judges of the Family Court to retire at least by the age recognised as the maximum retiring age for most other occupations in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is important that the Government’s nuclear safeguards policy be restated, not only for the benefit of a confused Opposition but also for the benefit of those in the community who have not yet grasped the comprehensive <span class="highlight">nature</span> of our safeguards policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no formal restriction on the amount of loan which can be approved but, because of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Bank’s functions, loans are rarely approved for an amount in excess of $300,000 for any one borrower. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-41-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the years- it has been years- that the public debate has gone on about the need to increase the price of Australian crude oil there also have been discussions, not only with the present Government but also with the former Labor Administration, about the possibility of something in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of a resource tax if the increased price eventuated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The changes will not compromise the independent role for which the Commission was established and are fully consistent with the often stated policy of the Government that it is the role of the IAC to advise and the responsibility of the Government to decide upon the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and levels of assistance which should be afforded particular industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth may be able to promote national legislation which applies uniform standards, ratios and things of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> to companies which operate in the building society industry, but at this stage the responsibility is primarily one that rests with the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771026_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I endorse what the  Chairman  of the Committee has said when he indicated that the members of the Committee are unanimous in the view that the alcohol problem among the Aboriginal people is of such a serious <span class="highlight">nature</span> that no member of the Committee who returns to the next parliament would be prepared to see inaction on the recommendations that have been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me say in conclusion that if something of a dramatic <span class="highlight">nature</span> is not undertaken the seriousness of the alcohol problem among Aboriginal people can easily reach genocidal proportions and this indigenous people, its cultures and traditions would stand in danger of total destruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is unfortunate that the public at large appears to have the impression that Parliament is little more than a venue for gladiatorial contests between political parties and because of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the system it is unaware of the considerable work done by parliamentarians of all parties behind the scenes in committees such as that of public accounts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to explain to those people that the Government’s attitude is not to do anything of a detrimental <span class="highlight">nature</span> to genuine trusts, but the Government is sincere in its desire to clamp down on the various tax avoidance schemes which have been built around trusts in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me that this device is the only insurance we have against those evils coming about because the Minister has no autocratic power to determine policies on the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of broadcasting systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems perfectly logical to me that the elected Government should determine the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of our systems and, having done that, to hand over to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal the power to apply the statutes- not to usurp from the elected representatives the responsibility for determining the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the system but to apply the criteria determined by this Government as to the system we should have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government must maintain an independent stance in this area so that it is in a position to determine the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of broadcasting and television services within this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It does not argue the validity of those assertions, and I think that in itself is also important because in any situation there are alternatives and in any major decision of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of a White Paper on defence or a strategic review there will be differing opinions among the experts and the advisers to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Additional measures which, by their <span class="highlight">nature</span>, require further detailed examination will be taken on the advice of a review which the Government is establishing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that one of the strengths in our society’s sustaining its democratic <span class="highlight">nature</span> is by the way in which power and authority are dispersed in smaller areas within the overall structure of our system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that if the Government wants  Mr Justice  Hope to hold any inquiry then it should set up an inquiry headed by him to find out just what did happen at the Hilton Hotel on Monday morning of last week, how it happened and who was responsible for the obvious failures in the general <span class="highlight">nature</span> of security at that hotel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When one represents an electorate of 391,000 square miles which has within its bounds almost every industry- secondary, primary and even tertiary- it is extremely difficult to make a speech encompassing the requirements of an electorate of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The way in which government can assist these industries in a general sense- this has been done over the past 2 years by this Government- is to look at their cost factors and to assist them in overcoming increasing costs which result from inflation, high interest rates and factors of a general <span class="highlight">nature</span> which affect the whole community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At various points in the Governor-General’s Speech the increasingly diverse <span class="highlight">nature</span> of Australian society is acknowledged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that in the structure of award rates and penalty rates, we must give some consideration to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, the point I wish to make by citing these instances is that in Australia the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of our unemployment benefit system has not taken account of the need to make people themselves more responsible for their financial being should they become unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think all honourable gentlemen would agree that decisions of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> were both desirable and economically responsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition objects to the express purpose and not the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister went on to say:  … the Government is of the view that standing legislation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> is more appropriate to the requirements of a long-term program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Government is of the view that standing legislation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> is more appropriate to the requirements of a long-term program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That sounds very good but if one cares to analyse the situation one realises that any Bill that comes into this House by its very <span class="highlight">nature</span> must be debated by the Parliament- not only by this House but by the other place as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Schemes surrounding outer suburbs of capital cities of a comparatively small <span class="highlight">nature</span> should, of course, be financed and built by State authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The first concerns the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the proposed Act and the second concerns the control we will be able to exercise through this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let me remind honourable members of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of that damage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The income tax cuts will increase disposable income and help to raise the overall level of demand but the benefit will be reduced greatly by using only half tax indexation in the middle of this year and by the biased <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the tax cuts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because of the short-term <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the proposal, provision has been made for the scheme to operate on an annual basis, ceasing on 30 September 1 980, and for the amount available for payment of bounty not to exceed $600,000 annually. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, last May Cabinet rejected a proposal to conduct a major inquiry into the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the present unemployment situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, in many other ways, as I have indicated in the amendment, the Government will probably go too far and in doing so, threaten the very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the IAC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Government would normally ask the Commission to advise it on the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and extent of assistance which, in the Commission ‘s view, should be given to particular industries, and that this question would not be limited in any way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would regard a ‘restriction’ as some statement or wording in the reference to the Commission which limits the range of recommendations the Commission can make about the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and extent of assistance which should be given to the industry covered by the reference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The IAC must be allowed to continue to state the pros and cons of its recommendations and to state the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of any conflicts it sees in the guidelines expressed to it by government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, the very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Australian economy, will demand levels of protection for as long as one can see ahead, but the important point is that the protection should be provided sensibly, appropriately and judiciously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have only to look at what has happened in recent years to see the nonsensical <span class="highlight">nature</span> of this directive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is the element, the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and the requirement of its independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter how we change the rules of the IAC and irrespective of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the report it brings back, the Government cannot do one thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This alters the competitive <span class="highlight">nature</span> of Australian industry to its detriment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When one looks at this whole argument it seems that it overlooks the way in which manufacturing industry in Australia has developed over the years in what I would describe as the regional <span class="highlight">nature</span> of manufacturing industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to this House- we all have to look at thisthat the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of mineral development involves a high degree of technology and in many areas it is not particularly a labour intensive industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The governments of other nations in the Western world, by virtue of their geographic location and the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of their work force, work on the basis that any worker will be retrained during the course of his working life up to three times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view the approach to these issues has been far too academic and far too unrelated to the geographical and regional <span class="highlight">nature</span> of Australian manufacturing industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, has the Government considered pursuing a less rigid and exclusive approach to Taiwan than it is claimed is presently required due to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of our diplomatic accord with China? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can only say that it leaves a very unpleasant flavour in one’s mouth to find that the Prime Minister should be goaded into action by IBM Australia, an organisation which in recent times has had association with the Government of such a <span class="highlight">nature</span> that it was able to persuade the Government to change the trade practices law contrary to firm attitudes expressed by the Government at an earlier stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I allowed some latitude to the honourable member for Lilley but it would be out of order in regard to both the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Bill and the presentation of the Bill by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs for the House to go into a general debate on this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Calls from the Metal Trades Industries Association of Australia, the Housing Industry Association and the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd for more expansionary policies are among a whole stream of calls of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> from what one would think would be from the point of view of honourable members opposite highly respectable circles, but this Government goes on blindly with its policy of attacking inflation first. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that I voice the views of every person sitting in this Parliament when I say that it would be absurd in the extreme to think that a committee of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> would be exposed to, or would be vulnerable in the least to, any blandishment that could be offered by any company in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Gill figures reveal the situation only with regard to males but in the past few weeks a project conducted by four Melbourne students under the control of a professional social worker entitled ‘A Study of Homeless Women in Melbourne’ has unveiled a crisis in Melbourne that the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the homeless women problem generally has hidden from society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point that is often overlooked in relation to railway services is that because of the historic <span class="highlight">nature</span> of those services- because railways were in so many ways the pioneers of our development during the latter part of the last century and the early part of this century and because of the role that they play in pioneering development- communities and activities tended to develop around the rail corridors which were established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an inevitable requirement of overcoming our present dilemma that there should be some common understanding among Australians as to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of our dilemma and the formula that might lead us into the more prosperous times that Australia might freely regard as its entitlement, being a land that is so bountifully served by national resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps it would have been better if the Prime Minister and the Government had first of all instituted a royal commission into the whole operation of the oil industry so that the real <span class="highlight">nature</span> of that industry and the exploitation of the Australian people by the large oil companies could have been properly examined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the broadcasting system in Australia until quite recently, together with the physical limitations of the availability of broadcasting frequencies, has tended to serve mass audiences well but to overlook those members of the various mass groupings with additional and quite specific interests outside those catered for in mass appeal programming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have selected these three terms of reference from a much wider range of terms of reference of one committee to show that the Government’s refusal to accept our proposal to establish a joint committee on unemployment is a blatant political decision taken at the highest level of the Government- in this case by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  who believes that the sole aim of the Opposition in having a committee of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> is to embarrass the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So it is odd but welcome to see someone from the Opposition acknowledging the extent and <span class="highlight">nature</span> of possible conflict between the objective of reducing unemployment and other policy objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances, to include members of the Labor Party in investigations into the <span class="highlight">nature</span>, extent and incidence of unemployment, into the social implications of unemployment and an examinaton of employment-creating schemes operating in overseas countries would be nothing more than a sham, an empty political exercise and a hypocritical one at that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should there not be a committee of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> looking at those kinds of contributions which are being made overseas to overcome the unemployment problem and the extent to which unemployment could be reduced by implementing and extending manpower programs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I should like to concentrate on paragraphs ( 1 ) and (2) of the motion, which deal with the extent of unemployment and the degree to which it has become a long term problem, and paragraph (7), which deals with the extent and <span class="highlight">nature</span> of possible conflict between the objective of reducing unemployment and other policy objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of world sugar trade it has long been accepted that some form of regulation of supplies on the so-called free market is essential if sugar producers are to receive reasonable and stable returns for their product and if sugar consumers are to be assured of reliable and stable supplies at reasonable prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I mentioned earlier, a tree on a plantation which was previously bare ground must be something of an improvement to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> or the character of the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Opposition’s view it is fair and reasonable that where there are criminal proceedings against a person there must be restrictions on admissibility of evidence, because of the serious <span class="highlight">nature</span> of those proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In other words, they would be records which are not just minor records but which are of a major <span class="highlight">nature</span> and could not all be signed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>This results from a very important rule, that is, that records are of their very <span class="highlight">nature</span> second hand evidence, and documents cannot stand up in a witness box and be cross-examined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We also thought that the Bill should be withdrawn and redrafted to prevent preparations in Australia for incursions in foreign countries on the basis that there would be a stockpiling of weapons, training, drilling, recruitment or any action at all that could be deemed to be of a preparatory <span class="highlight">nature</span> to hostilities in foreign countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Opposition objects most strongly to the fact that clause 7 still allows action of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> to take place on the basis of being deemed to be on behalf of the government of a foreign country that we recognise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are we to have a situation in Australia in which people can urge the stockpiling of weapons, drill armies and engage in other matters of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> in order to support some action on behalf of the Portuguese Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The acts referred to in clause 7 are not illegal unless they are of a preparatory <span class="highlight">nature</span> to an offence against clause 6. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us not create legislation which by its very <span class="highlight">nature</span> will become impossible to enforce and will create more problems for the Attorney-General of the day because of its provisions, which, given some of the situations which historically have arisen in Australia, are difficult and complex enough to be dealt with by the government of the day but which certainly will not be solved in any way at all by this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This House should demand a cool explanation of the <span class="highlight">nature</span>, form and possibilities of terrorism in this society, some critical examination of the threats we need to guard against. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is an unfortunate fact that in situations of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> some parts of the media tend to lay stress on the ethnic background of people involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that all areas of the media in reporting instances of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> would keep in mind the effect that their reports can have on the successful integration of people into the broader Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the one hand, publicly, he pretends to support Aboriginal welfare programs which are of the same <span class="highlight">nature</span> as those which the Aboriginal movement presents and on the other, privately, he enters into sleazy, secret deals with the Queensland Government, allowing the Government of that State to maintain raciallybased policies on Aboriginal welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say at once that the honourable gentleman does not understand the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the legislation establishing the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that it would have been in the interests of Aboriginal people throughout Australia to look at the possible conjunction of the activities of the Land Fund Commission and the Aboriginal entitlement capital account referred to in the policy statement of the present Government of November 1975 and also to look at that account and its particular <span class="highlight">nature</span> related to the question of dispossession and dispersal of Aboriginals which, as I pointed out, is the very fundamental purpose for the creation of the Commission along with other activities in this area of the Department and other instrumentalities of the Government, namely the Loans Commission and the grants-in-aid for enterprise purposes provided by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Due to the complex technical <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the legislation the Government does not intend to resume the debate on the Bill for at least a few weeks to allow adequate opportunity for comment on the technical aspects of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Corporation requires this power in the event that its funds, which are derived from a levy on exports of fresh apples and pears and a levy on apples and pears used for both processing and for sale on fresh fruit markets, are not sufficient to meet promotional expenditure costs of the seasonal <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the receipts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer now to the other half of this legislation, the half concerning pears, because as is usual in debates of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>, particularly with Tasmanian members of Parliament and to a certain extent my friends the honourable member for Hume  (Mr Lusher)  and the honourable member for Calare  (Mr MacKenzie),  the subject has been apples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, it is our judgment, after considering all relevant factors, that a contingency provision of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> is a proper and responsible discharge of our duty to provide for the health and safety of people in Australia, and the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>2, 1 refer you,  Mr Speaker,  to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of that motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also suggest that the alteration of the articles of the society brings in the question of whether alterations of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> accord with the relevant State legislation, because the body in question is registered under the laws of the State of Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it were suggested that moneys of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> be made available to some of the less popular organisations in this country, honourable members opposite would be on their feet demanding to know exactly where, why and how the funds were to be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I will not comment on the accuracy or otherwise of those despatches from the confidentiality of the party room, but I was interested to note that afterwards I got many letters and telephone calls of congratulation from people who said ‘Good on you for sticking up for the ABC, or ‘Thanks for protecting the ABC, and other messages of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One gets complaints about particular groups controlling the licence or, in the case of ethnic radio programs, a particular faction in an ethnic community getting control of the hour’s time slot for that particular ethnic community and putting over propaganda which is divisive in its <span class="highlight">nature</span> and which produces tensions within that ethnic community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A local newspaper cannot produce the sort of journalism that one finds in the Melbourne  Truth  or in the  Sunday Observer  or newspapers of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> because local newspapers fundamentally are dependent on the goodwill of their local communities and the sort of feedback they get from them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I expect what he means is that in these public broadcasting stations it will be possible for a sponsor to have his message put across by the announcer saying, ‘The following quarter hour is brought to you courtesy of Joe Bloggs, your friendly local butcher’, or ‘The following municipal information is brought to you by the Croydon City Council’, or giving some brief message of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Much depends upon the precise <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the legislation which has to be determined by agreement in discussions and consultations between the Commonwealth Minister and State Ministers and officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say that there was some extensive and, as the agreement notes, earnest and sometimes vigorous discussion in relation to it, but I believe that the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the agreement indicates that both governments approached the matter with cooperation foremost in their minds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One may well ask, in view of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the interjection, just how seriously the honourable member regards this distressing situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Before I call the Minister I point out that a question of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>, calling for such detailed informaton over such a period, is beyond being what could be regarded as a reasonable question to ask of a Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course the honourable gentleman, being a resident of Queensland, would appreciate that any local government is, by its very name and <span class="highlight">nature</span>, a self-governing or self-managing authority in respect of the area over which it has authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So clearly, on the former Treasurer’s own statement, the Prime Minister knew or ought to have known or was in fact fully informed by the former Treasurer of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of that right honourable gentleman’s business transactions and dealings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was appointed when the parameters for development and initial planning guidelines were being established, and the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the role that he played in land development on the Mornington Peninsula in the two years in which he was  chairman  meant that  Mr Leake  was an active participant in all the relevant planning decisions in the Westernport area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To answer that question one has to understand the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of existing developments and what occurred in Hastings to very many old sub-divisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only did they not present the facts in a manner and form which demonstrated that they had an understanding of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the events in the days when their Party was in government, but also they said nothing until, perhaps, the honourable member for Lalor  (Mr Barry Jones)  said that really it was all a matter of revenge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We can find nothing of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> in this statement except a euphemistic sort of statement which says: ‘We will encourage the long term development of more competitive industries’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One would have thought that the  Deputy  Prime Minister when making a statement of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> could have indicated how the Government will help the travel industry and encourage people to come to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In other words, if there are penalties for late delivery and matters of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> surely we would expect a better performance than that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is, in addition to the continental shelf legislation already in place, the first of a number of measures which will be taken to create a full exclusive economic zone, when the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of that zone is more clearly defined by international agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are also other amendments of a minor <span class="highlight">nature</span>, many of which relate to providing reference to the Australian fishing zone throughout the Act as appropriate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other amendment is of a machinery <span class="highlight">nature</span> only and results from certain amendments to the Continental Shelf (Living Natural Resources) Amendment Bill 1973 which were moved and accepted in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The decisions that will be made by the Minister for Transport  (Mr Nixon)  in the coming months regarding aviation reviews are most important and will affect the whole <span class="highlight">nature</span> of aviation in Australia in the years to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-One can agree with the previous speakers that both of the Bills dealt with in this cognate debate are unexceptional in <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact some of the States, recognising the unsatisfactory <span class="highlight">nature</span> of clause 8, made lengthy submissions to the Minister urging that the full $300m of the program be allocated at the beginning and that it be incorporated in the schedule of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that history is not improperly recorded, I inform the House, for the benefit of those who do not know, that it was as a result of an Australian Transport Advisory Council meeting in South Australia in July 1972 at which I tabled a report of the Bureau of Transport Economics on the needs of urban public transport that the first Bill of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> was introduced in 1973 after the change in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>

    <p>The changing <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the labour market in Australia, particularly the emergence of structural imbalances, has required successive governments to introduce manpower programs such as the National Employment and Training scheme- NEAT- aimed at overcoming labour market problems suffered by particular groups within the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is all very well to talk about all those conceptsimproving productivity, improving economies of scale, the rationalisation of product lines and company structures and marketing procedures and so forth- but one cannot, in the same breath, condemn the Government for having a high protectionist policy, which is designed to enable a climate to be established in which companies will make decisions of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> and which, as a consequence, will lead to some unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A discretion would then lie with every assessor who applied himself to the particular problem and, because of the subjective <span class="highlight">nature</span> of deciding what is appropriate, there would then be no certainty present at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My problem is simply this: Having voted for and strongly supported that proposition in 1974, I, bearing in mind the respect in which I hold my colleagues who take a contrary view, find it possible to vote publicly now for legislation which creates, as I will demonstrate, a precedent in Australia, because this is the first time in this country that legislation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> and the known implications of it passing are to be dealt with by the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The present situation is really one of an ad hoc <span class="highlight">nature</span> that is being argued not on principle or convention but on the grounds of loss of revenue, blatancy or the fact that there would be only a minimal loss to those who have subscribed to the Curran scheme since last August. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the fact that the company did not distribute that money meant that when the Labor Party came to power it retrospectively destroyed the tax free <span class="highlight">nature</span> of those reserves amounting to something like $25m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The strength of the presumption against retrospectivity in any particular case, and accordingly the ease or difficulty with which it may be overcome, must, I would think, depend on the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and degree of the injustice which would result from giving a statute a retrospective operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, in the Tribunal report once again special mention is made of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of advertising and station promotions that are being used by some commercial television stations during those children’s hours- 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and at weekends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are some rather undergraduatish comments upon the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of our system, but under those circumstances I say without hesitation or reservation that  Dr Fitzgerald  has insufficient judgment, insufficient understanding and insufficient balance to fill this most important position- one of very great prestigeas the first  chairman,  recommended by the Government, of the Australia-China Foundation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am concerned- I have expressed this concern in this House on a previous occasion- about the continual statements of the Minister for Defence  (Mr Killen)  in which he has made it quite clear that he is seeking to remove surveillance of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> mentioned by the honourable member for Dawson, that is, coastal surveillance of territorial integrity, from the function of the Defence Force, despite the fact that in the Government’s White Paper on defence that function is clearly set out in a number of places as being an accepted function of the Defence Force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That being so, the very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the contest is such that from the point of view of the Minister it would be a saving in time and cost and a better use of the capacities of the Court if right from the start these cases were subject to a process under which they were dealt with by a Full Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are only about eight Cocos-Malays left who, if they offer themselves for work, will be provided with work of what is described as a municipal <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, I will remind you time and again, so that I am speaking to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Bill, that the tariff is very much part of an industry policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first, of course, is that the size of our quota in the Fund determines how much we can borrow from the Fund when we have balance of payments problems of a temporary <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The seventh quota review which comes up before too long is, I should hope, likely to be of a more equi-proportional <span class="highlight">nature</span> than this review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In line with what I said earlier, there was a great deal of suspicion on the part of some trade union officials and many employers that the broad definition of trade union training contained in the existing Act might allow a number of courses of a very broad ideological <span class="highlight">nature</span> to be introduced into the trade union training syllabus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill to amend the Trade  Union  Training Authority Act 1975 is the result of the Government’s nearly total lack of understanding of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and aims of the Australian trade union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Government simply does not understand the <span class="highlight">nature</span> or aims of the broad labour movement in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will avoid a great amount of confusion because the emphasis must not be on educational matters, as I have said previously; it rather should be of a practical <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is sad because it involves an issue which until the introduction of this Bill virtually was dealt with in this Parliament on a bipartisan basis, with all parties agreeing on the need for trade union training and with all parties in broad agreement on the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the structure that ought to be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member referred to the longterm <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the benefits of trade union training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is particularly so when decisions are made on the Conciliation and Arbitration Act or matters of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>, or when discussions are held on such matters as Commonwealth Employment Service offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of industrial legislation and the views taken by the two sides of the House on it, make it inevitable that there will be occasions on which it is not possible to reach unanimity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister does not believe that trade union training authorities, or, to be specific, the Trade Union Training Authority by its <span class="highlight">nature</span> is an educational institution, let him say so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I want to underline what has been said by previous speakers about the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of speeches made in second reading debates in this House and to say that the intelligence of members has been insulted repeatedly by speeches of the type we heard during the debate on this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third point I want to make, which takes me more closely into the Bill, is to draw attention to the way in which the power has been shifted within the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the Trade Union Training Authority so that we now have elevated in place of a broadly representative board- other honourable members have referred to this- a National Director appointed by the Minister operating in the context of an executive which clearly can be controlled by management when the  Chairman  appointed by the Minister is prepared to go in that direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-by leave- The purpose of this statement is to set out the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the regulation and control which the Government will exercise over the export marketing of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not therefore see a need to proceed with legislation in the current sittings, and prior to consultations with the States on the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and desirability of legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might add that in view of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the advice that the Authority would need to provide, it would not be appropriate for its members to be chosen from the companies which were participating in the marketing of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, given the import of it and the impact on the Australian uranium industry I think it would have been reasonable if the Government had demonstrated some confidence in the confidentiality that the Opposition would observe and had given it much prior notice of a statement of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has not enabled us time to really consult with the States as to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the legislation and the desirability of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that during the recess period I shall have an opportunity of being able to discuss with the States the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the legislation I intend to bring forward as a forerunner to establishing a marketing authority which can advise the Government on action it should take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have an instinctive feeling that the sheer extent of public expenditure in Australia and the very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of public enterprise make it almost impossible for that expenditure to be properly accounted for on behalf of its shareholders, the Australian taxpayers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the question is an examination of the Acting Prime Minister in a way that runs the risk of making it appear that the Royal Commission would take into account matters which were not evidence before the Commission but debate in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The rush is because he wants to say something overseas and is prepared not only to risk the bipartisan <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the attitude towards foreign investment which has been developed by this Parliament but also the confidence that has developed behind the guidelines enumerated by an earlier Labor Government and laid down almost in mirror fashion by the present Government in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To ask this proposed committee also to engage in some sort of analysis of the effects of the Act on the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of marriage and the family I think would be to refer an area of inquiry which ought not to be properly the purview or responsiblity of the committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the honourable member for Lilley  (Mr Kevin Cairns),  who is sponsoring the foreshadowed amendments, were to propose the establishment of a parliamentary committee to look at the whole question of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the family in Australian society and the pressures upon it, I would support him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Given the complexity of the legal problems that have to be considered, I do not know how the proposed committee, on the basis of  2Vi  years’ experience of the operation of an Act which essentially involves an exercise in legal operations- it is a legal concept- can say that that Act has had any effects on the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of marriage, and if so, what effects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What do we mean by the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of marriage? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">nature</span> of marriage really involves questions of polemic which in themselves can involve philosophers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest to the honourable gentleman that we are living in a society in which the rate of change and the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of our economic system have put the family under tremendous and inordinate pressures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that to add to that the interesting question of the effects on the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of marriage and the family and to isolate the operations of this Act in terms of that very important question is to confuse the very important question of marriage breakdown with the question of divorce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this amendment is to allow the proposed joint committee to investigate the provisions and the operations of the Family Law Act 1975 with particular regard to the ground of divorce and whether there should be other grounds and its effect on the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of marriage and the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So I do not know why the honourable member for Melbourne Ports should be frightened about the committee looking at the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">nature</span> of marriage has changed also for some very basic internal reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the war histories record many other unfortunate wartime occurrences of a similar <span class="highlight">nature</span> which took place in New Guinea, I can only assume that objective historians although they have known through verbal accounts and through allusions in files which have remained and are available for research, are not prepared to write history without the necessary supporting evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The investigation would need to establish the correctness of conflicting allegations and is therefore of a <span class="highlight">nature</span> we are unable to undertake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has not, however, been informed of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of these matters; no specific allegations having been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But most important of all, due to the very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the problem of homelessness, this program needs to be administered predominantly by church and charitable organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To understand why these organisations are so important one needs to understand the very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that further inquiries should be made as to the very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of this problem, because that is a very serious difference of opinion between professional people working in the field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the problem, as outlined in this report, requires a compassionate response from the community at large, quite apart from the official governmental response I referred to earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, in supporting the Bill, I hope that the Government will use the review period to look at some of the matters I have raised, such as the definition and extent of homelessness, the inherent <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the problem, the responsibilities of the various levels of government, the proper and potential functions of homeless persons centres, and the adequacy of present subsidy arrangements with eligible organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the new arrangements Tor the program were announced at the time of the Premiers Conference in June, and of course are fully in line with the Government’s policy of federalism, which recognises that States and local governments are well placed to assume greater responsibility for locally-based programs of this <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt),  who represents in this chamber the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  that although I agree completely with the view that matters of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> are better determined at a State government level by virtue of its proximity to the scene, I would very much like to see the Commonwealth having some say, or exercising a larger interest than may have happened in the past in determining whether these projects are needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only has the Government changed its mind, such is the hurried <span class="highlight">nature</span> of its approach to this legislation, but quite frankly I do not think there has been any proper consideration given to the Bill at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would remind the honourable member for Griffith, as well as other members of the Opposition, that the  chairman  should be a person who is given sufficient flexibility both in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of his qualifications and in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of his appointment to carry out his functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the type of aspect that the group must look at to make sure that the balance of <span class="highlight">nature</span> is left and so that we can develop and exploit the reef- I do not use the word ‘exploit’ from the point of view of trying to take everything out of the Reef- in harmony with that natural balance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What we must do, if we look, for instance, at the Iwasaki project, is make sure that, if Iwasaki commences development because the laws of Queensland and the laws of the Commonwealth are such that he can now start development, that development conforms not only to the laws of local government, the State government and the national government but also to the laws of <span class="highlight">nature</span>, and that if the development is there it is only to enhance the natural aspects of the area and certainly not to destroy them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The real problem, as these estimates revealnot that we have discovered this for the first time by any means- is that there is no coherent method of determining the <span class="highlight">nature</span> or the extent of intervention in the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is nearly 200 years since Australia received its first immigrants and because of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of our first colonisation, Australia became less of an Aboriginal community and more of a British or European community over those 200 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have indicated that the Government takes the South Pacific seriously for a variety of reasons, but it is not merely my rhetoric and my undertakings made in this place or in announcements made at South Pacific Forums which are important; it is the very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the amounts given under the aid program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the main criticisms in that case arose from the fact that no expert evidence was called from people who might be considered leading authorities on the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of Aboriginal land claims, namely, anthropologists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It warns the growers that, unless they are able to require undertakings given by members who purport to represent them, they can expect further legislation of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> and of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the nitrogenous fertiliser legislation to withdraw direct government supportother than talk- from their industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  who is at the table, to make sure that before another Bill of this <span class="highlight">nature</span> is produced for Parliament to scrutinise copies of the legislation, or at least information on its general thrust, will be available to the industry more readily than as happened with this piece of legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it found that those things should happen, it was to inquire into what the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and extent of the assistance should be, as well as for what period of time any recommended assistance should be provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Papua New Guinea has been put on notice tonight by the honourable member for Bonython  (Dr Blewett)  who indicated quite clearly that the quantum of aid to Papua New Guinea, quite apart from its <span class="highlight">nature</span>, ought to be re-examined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So not only did the Hayden Budget reduce aid expressed in terms of a percentage of the gross national product but also the aid program pursued by the Labor Party did not embrace the sorts of concepts which the honourable member for Bonython was calling for and which was implicit in the speech of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, namely, a change in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the aid programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>Changes that we have made in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of our aid programs, particularly to the South Pacific to which the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition referred, illustrate not merely that we can increase quantum in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only has this Government introduced a conceptual framework to our foreign policy, restored relationships with other countries and furthered our role in the region in the important area of economic relations and trade relations with ASEAN and the South Pacific countries but also in the particular areas of importance to us as well as to them- we should never dismiss that element which is of some importance, namely, that we have a responsibility in our own region and not just to distant lands- we have not merely increased the amounts of money available but more particularly we have changed the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the programs to provide both flexibility and forward planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the report is couched in the terms I have indicated- namely, that this building just cannot be brought to modern fire protection standards because of the manner in which extensions have been made to it, the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of its structure and the complete lack of any rational communications or accesses within the building- I think that someone ought to say something about it and try to undertake the necessary corrective actions if possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no doubt, if we are prepared to face what had been occurring plainly in Australia, that the tax laws of this country- the weight of taxation, the punitive <span class="highlight">nature</span> of death, estate and gift duties- had caused people in small businesses of many kinds, whether in country towns, in the cities, or on farms, in an effort to hold those businesses together and to leave something to their children, to enter into a degree of complication in their affairs which was providing the only possible avenue of survival, especially in a low income situation which has been typical of many small businesses, whether on farms or otherwise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These funds, which are broadly in the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of accumulation trusts, are taxed at a rate equal to the maximum rate of personal tax and, in consequence of the proposed temporary increase of  11/2  per cent in the rates of personal income tax for  1978-79,  the rate of tax applicable to the income of these funds is to be increased from  60  per cent to  6 11/2  per cent for the  1 978-79  financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, particularly in relation to a delegation to India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, it is very difficult for most Australians, certainly most Australian politicians- this includes myself- to make the imaginative jump between the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of our society and the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the societies they are visiting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At this point I am not inclined to give the assurance sought by the honourable member, not because I want to create speculation that there might be some decision taken that would allow Bankstown Airport to have jet facilities, but because I have purposefully- I use that word advisedly- not come to any conclusions on any of the suggestions of that <span class="highlight">nature</span> simply so that when the MANS study is properly concluded and has reported individually to the State Minister and to me on the needs of Sydney we will be able to come to tight decisions without too much emotion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The general approach of Ministers has been that only urgent amendments should be included in the initial legislation and that other amendments of a law reform <span class="highlight">nature</span> should wait until after the initial legislation has been enacted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us look at the insurance concept, at the basic <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the investment and savings process, at the role that accumulators of funds such as banks and life companies might play; ask stock exchanges what they think; and see whether some sort of guarantee fund in conjunction with the listing requirements and listed companies could not be developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result, the amendments in the Bill are of a technical and non-controversial <span class="highlight">nature</span>, which do not make substantial changes in any areas of the Act that are singled out by the terms of reference for the Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act, or which are likely to become the subject of submissions to the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the honourable member for Hawker has indicated to me that I should utilise the time that is remaining for General Business matters, let me point out that the whole gamut of what I have been saying is set out in Article 14 of a convention of the United Nations which, in part, says that all persons shall be equal before courts and tribunals; they will be entitled to be informed promptly and in detail in a language which they understand of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and cause of the charge; they will be entitled to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of defence; they will be entitled to be tried in their presence and to defend themselves in person or through legal assistance of their own choosing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because .of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the medical procedure which is the subject of this motion, the question of medical necessity requires each of us to answer certain fundamental questions about the general issue of abortion before we can reasonably cast a vote on the motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With three-quarters of a million Australians unable to find a job- that is, the Australians who want one- and with enormous changes taking place in our trading patterns, and so on, each one of the IAC reports, as I have indicated earlier, and each one of the tariff proposals which flow from Government decisions about the IAC’s advice is more sensitive in <span class="highlight">nature</span> and more important to our economy than previously applied and requires close scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Contrary to the contentions of the honourable member for Darling Downs  (Mr McVeigh)  there are many anxieties in the community about the far-reaching <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the provisions of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the advice given to the Minister, I do not think it is right and proper that it should be the Director-General who decides on the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of advice to be given in the communications that take place between ASIO and the government and its agencies, such as the Department of Defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only justification which occurs to one- it occurs readily, given the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of this Government, given the way in which it seeks to manipulate and at times even to corrupt the political processes for its own ends- is political manipulation and patronage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is important because there is a substantial pattern of consistent evidence that, although the Government has laid down criteria that there should be an avoidance of discussion of matters of a political <span class="highlight">nature</span> which may lead to tension, the interpretation and application of these guidelines is exclusively in terms of something which may be somewhat to the Left to clearly to the Left. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To our knowledge  Mr Georgiou  has a competent understanding of the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and problems of ethnic communities in Australian society and we believe that by virtue of academic background and involvement on the Prime Minister’s staff in recent years he has gained sensitivity and understanding with respect to problems of public administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An examination of the personnel and structure of that Committee will indicate the difficulties which exist in having it meet on any regular basis and certainly one can see the difficulties which exist in examining proposals which would be considered to be of a reformist <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I assume that the Opposition would not be satisfied with an annual report that just listed the name of the DirectorGeneral and said that the organisation had functioned; it would want information about the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the organisation, what it is doing and the way in which it exercises its special powers, particularly the powers that are designed to assist it in collecting information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be of more advantage to Russian security organisationsthe KGB or something of that <span class="highlight">nature</span>- for them to know how much money is going into ASIO, where it is spent and what are its priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition strongly opposes clause 8 (2) (c) for its restrictions on the power of the Attorney-General to give specific directions ‘concerning the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the advice that should be given by ASIO to a Minister, Department or authority of the Commonwealth’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The approach should be one of national importance, not parochial in <span class="highlight">nature</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the other two matters- that is, the communication of intelligence relating to individuals and the <span class="highlight">nature</span> and advice to be given to a Minister- are matters that should not fall within the sole jurisdiction of the DirectorGeneral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, if the subversion is very real and very dangerous there must certainly be a fair amount of evidence as to its reality and the dangerous <span class="highlight">nature</span> of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was concerned not merely because it was another strike, but because involved in that strike were quite powerful communist elements, who made no bones of the fact that they intended to alter the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of government within Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the ASIO beast ensures that security will remain a matter of subjective definition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the very <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the subversive acts intended to be kept under surveillance it must be a matter of judgment, both by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation as well as by society, because a mixture of social, political and constitutional elements of the framework of Australian democracy are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The point is that we should not give our security intelligence forces responsibilities for legal interpretations which by their very <span class="highlight">nature</span> must involve some subjective analysis as to whether there has been force, or whether the actions in question, are an essential part of the political fabric of the particular organisation which is under scrutiny, and use of that force is part of the ongoing methods that they regard as both legitimate and proper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to deal in some detail with the Government’s view of the deficit because clearly, over the last several years, there has been a great deal said in this Parliament and outside it about the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the deficit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are the matters on which the honourable member for Gellibrand spoke at such length, namely, the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the deficit to be made up of the credits and the debits ofthe three funds- the Consolidated Revenue Fund, the Loan Fund and the Trust Fund- as well as the conception of the interest rate structure in the Australian economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Traditionally the Loan Bill is a mechanical Bill that has to do with the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of funding of the Consolidated Revenue Fund that is carried on so that the normal services of government can be developed during a particular year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are any number of cases which illustrate that as long as the amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act are procedural in <span class="highlight">nature</span>, there is nothing unconstitutional in them because no legislative controls are imposed over how a commissioner may exercise his discretionary powers to prevent and settle industrial disputes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will notice that clause (2) provides in the performance of his functions under the Act the Director-General of Security is subject to the general directions of the Minister but that the Minister is not empowered to override the opinion of the Director-General concerning the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the advice that should be given by the Austraiian Security Intelligence Organisation to a Minister, department or authority of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But we say that paragraph (c), which relates to the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the advice which should be given by the Organisation to a Minister, is fundamental to the whole arrangement of an intelligence organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In summary, clause 8 provides that the Minister is not empowered to override the opinion of the Director-General on whether the collection of intelligence by the Organisation concerning a particular individual would or would not be justified by reason of its relevance to security, on the question of whether the communication of intelligence concerning a particular individual would be for a purpose relevant to security or concerning the <span class="highlight">nature</span> of the advice that should be given by the organisation to a Minister, department or authority of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
