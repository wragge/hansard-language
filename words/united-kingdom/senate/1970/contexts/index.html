    <p>In view of the announcement on the radio today that European Economic Community countries have invited the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> to apply for membership of the organisation, and the fact that this means so much to Australia in the matter of trade, will the Australian Government endeavour to have an observer present at any negotiations between Britain and the countries of the European Economic Community which are not held in closed conference? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for External Affairs: ls it a fact that although Great Britain recognised Communist China in 1949, in the 21 years since then Communist China has refused to receive an ambassador from the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> on the ground that no ambassador will be received until the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> breaks off relations with Taiwan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Might T say in passing that this hocus pocus - this is the only description for the position that pertains in the European Economic Community today - is the organisation which the British Government proposes to join and about which farmers in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> have expressed the very gravest misgivings - and no wonder! <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is of interest to note that, while the Labour Government of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> is hell bent on joining the European Economic Community, so too is the Conservative Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no doubt that in that period the links with the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> were stronger and strong links were forged with the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> feels it proper to pull out from east of Suez, it appears - I have heard nothing to the contrary - that the Butterworth air base has been handed over to the Government of Malaysia by the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, by way of contrast, recruits of the right calibre have been and are still being attracted, but the conditions of employment there are superior to those hitherto offered by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, the salaries in the Parliamentary Counsel’s Office in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> are, by design, above those of corresponding levels in the general legal service of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Government and are among the highest in the British Civil Service: the First Parliamentary Counsel is treated as the head of a government department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> the draftsmen are styled Parliamentary Counsel and appear to enjoy a rather higher standing in the legal profession than do their opposite numbers in Commonwealth and State services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  President  Johnson’s declaration was debated here in the Senate I made the observation - I have continued to repeat this observation - that, as the United States is our ally and we are involved in responsive obligations to the United States and as it can ask for the return obligations from Australia, it was perfectly safe - indeed, it was proper and strategically in terms of grand strategy it was of paramount importance - that we should advance in a forward disposition into the South East Asian area because at that time we were protected in our advance positions by an alliance with the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first thing that happened - this became clear enough some years ago - was that, for reasons which  Senator Mulvihill  advanced,  Mr Healey,  speaking on behalf of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Government, stated that the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> was no longer able to maintain the financial drain on its resources involved in keeping a presence east of Suez. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore a decision was made that the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> would withdraw from east of Suez. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In practical terms this meant that the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> would run its forces down in the Malaysian peninsula and Singapore and begin to move them back into north western Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> obviously is not withdrawing totally from east of Suez. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For reasons the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> government of the day considers proper, it is leaving a garrison of about 10,000 troops in Hong Kong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> forces will leave the Singapore and Malaysia area finally by 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Government has provided a part substitute in the form of an exercise which is being engaged in at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that in any circumstances in which danger might threaten in the South East Asian area the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> would be able to mount such an operation as that on which it is engaged at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that in the global grand strategic picture in which we are involved it would merely require the Soviet Union to make threatening noises in north western Europe for the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation partners to refuse the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> the right to withdraw troops from the NATO area in order to fly them to South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second is this: There may be circumstances such as those which existed in 1941 in which the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> would not be able to assume tine obligation which Australia might ask it to accept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the kind of obligation which it has accepted in the past, that in the event of war in the Pacific the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> would make naval forces available to provide a covering force in Singapore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> was unable to fulfil itscommitment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no apologies to make for speaking as an individual here in my place in the Senate as to the change that must take place in Australia’s foreign policy and Australia’s defence because the concepts on which defence and foreign policy were directed in the 1950s and 1960s has disappeared with the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>’s withdrawal from east of Suez and the United States retreat - not retreat but retirement - to the area where it can exercise its greatest strategical flexibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is all very well for the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> to say to the people of Fiji: ‘We are giving you your independence’, as the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> is in the process of doing, but when the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> walks out of Fiji someone has to pick up some of the tabs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Not long ago  Mr Denis  Healey, the Secretary of State for Defence in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, published a White Paper on the defence position of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A few years ago when I was in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> some Labor members of the British Government were advocating a reduction in the defence commitment so that, as they put it, they would be able to extend their social services programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is following a pattern which seems to have worked reasonably well in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700423_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such programmes receive support from Government cultural agencies in other countries including the United States of America, <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and West Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was ihe reason why the Commonwealth bought into the overseas container shipping service through the purchase of a vessel for the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> trade, and one or two ships for the Japanese trade, lt also intends to acquire a ship for the trade to North America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people dismissed it because they thought it would involve a very insignificant part of Tasmania’s trade - they had in mind the quantity of products that go overseas to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> - and that it was a matter about which we had no need to be greatly concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the quantity of produce that is shipped to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> from Tasmania is small, nevertheless it is of very great importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The representatives of the overseas consortium indicated - and they were questioned about this many times - that the inauguration of container services from Tasmania to the feeder ports on the mainland would receive fairly prompt attention and that it would not be very long after container services were running from Australia to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> before exports to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> from Tasmania would be included in the container services for the whole of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then he said - and it seems to me that this statement fits the case for the provision of container services from Tasmania to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision of feeder services-  and he is referring to services from Tasmania to the feeder ports for cargoes to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>:  to Tasmanian ports is, in the first instance,  a  matter for commercial negotiation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of investigations into these disabilities and problems, as they affect the Tasmanian apple industry, it came to light that the rates of freight on apples from New Zealand to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and other European markets were very much lower than the rates of freight on apples sent from Tasmania to those European markets, taking all things into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>of the old Federal Exporters Oversea Transport Committee, which dealt with all aspects of freights, tonnages and problems involved in the export of Australian goods particularly to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and the Continent, I can say that that Committee dealt fairly with the States as a national committee and recognised the rights of Tasmania equally with those of any other State of the Commonwealth including my own Stale of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the concept of containerisation was introduced in Australian trade to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the build-up of tonnage on the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> run this type of ship - this is the only one to which I can refer on this aspect because the Scandias are coming in on this run - could bring benefits to States such as Tasmania and South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since the withdrawal of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> from South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that parliamentary draftsmen in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> are amongst the highest paid, if not the highest paid, parliamentary draftsmen in the world but, notwithstanding that fact and a recognised superiority in performance in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, there still are vacancies in the drafting office in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 believe that the Commonwealth has adopted the principle which exists in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> where I understand that the value of land, not the value of the rural section of the estate, is taken in at 50% of the sworn value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think I should say in answer to that question, which will have to be directed in its generality to the department concerned, that J share with the honourable senator his concern at any prospect of an increase in shipping freight rates for Australian exports, more particularly in this instance the ones to which he referred - from Australia to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the light of these considerations it is intended that, in general, the costs of conversion should, as for instance in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, lie where they fall. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Over 90% of the world’s population lives in countries using the metric system, and countries which in recent times have either launched conversion programmes or announced their intention to convert to its use include the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, South Africa, Pakistan, Eire, New Zealand and Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 considered that we were suffering, if that is the right word, from the fact that we are an English speaking country and that both the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and the United States of America have nourishing film industries in the English language and that, therefore, a country with u population the size of ours and with the need to develop in so many directions could not possibly afford to develop this industry in competition with either the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> or the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of quotas operating in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and the United States of America anil shrinking markets in other parts of the world, the prospects of selling this surplus are remote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>whether it is the present voluntary scheme or a compulsory scheme as proposed by the Labor Party, some agreement has to be reached between the Government and the medical practitioners unless there is to be a nationalisation of medicine as in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think that it is useful to make comparisons with what has happened in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and what would happen under the scheme proposed by the Australian Labor Party because there are essential differences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under a scheme such as is proposed by the Labor Party where a person has to meet none of the cost there is always the great danger - this has happened in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> - of over-servicing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But in my humble opinion that sort of thing - as in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and as in Scandinavia, about which we have heard something this afternoon - contains within itself if not the seeds of its own destruction then certainly the seeds of mediocrity, inefficiency, dissatisfaction and discontent on the part of the people who are served. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> has had committees reporting to the Government and setting out to devise ways and means by which the health services - the doctor services and all the rest of them - can be improved, lt has been a matter of very great concern to many people in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> that there was so much leeway to be made up over recent years after the scheme had been in operation for a long time, not only in regard to medical services but also in regard to hospital services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the pattern of experience in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> is that people will use the free hospital and medical services that are available there to an extent of overusage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The projected entry or non-entry of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> into the European Economic Community is a matter which has been before the eyes of Australia for some years now and which has been constantly under review by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The company was principally or predominantly controlled by interests in the United States of America, although a good deal of <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> money had been invested in the venture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It makes reference to what has happened in other countries such as the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, Canada and New Zealand, lt also states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These aircraft are coming from Canada, France, the Netherlands, <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700605_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were doing that in conjunction with not only our own Government Aircraft Factories but also other companies - notably the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation and the British Aircraft Corporation in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700605_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aircraft industries in countries such as the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, France and the United States of America are much better geared to volume production than we could ever hope to be at this stage of our history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700605_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were conned into coming to this country on the basis of information given to them verbally at the recruitment centres in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and they found themselves in the intolerable position of purchasing homes close to the factory at Lara and then having to sell them on a depressed market if they desired to continue in the industry by finding work in the metropolitan area or at Hawker de Havilland in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700605_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we get another project by this hit and miss method that the Government is using now we will have to hotfoot it off to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> again seeking recruits from the industry in that country and no doubt will tell them the same story that there is continuity of work in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700605_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when looking around for orders and for further development of that aircraft the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Government came to the conclusion that it could not go on with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700605_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only  Senator Devitt  and I but also other people will be well aware of the pioneering work done in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> in aircraft design and thought and the development of new types of aircraft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700605_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had hoped that the agreement with the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> would help to put the industry in this country back on its feet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700605_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall the honourable senator asking a qi.ies.ion in which he invited the Government to give some consideration to the preparation of a White Paper concerning the proposed entry of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> into the European Economic Community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not quite certain whether a White Paper dealing not with the particular problems facing Australia as a result of such an entry but wilh the effects such an application might have as far as the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Government is concerned is not something- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But before one ascertains the implications to Australia one has to consider the hypothetical entry of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> into the Community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is highly unlikely, or improbable, that a White Paper could be produced in Australia until a deep study had been made of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>’s position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The United States will bethe only major trading nation which has not initiated a programme of conversion.I have seen Press reports emanating from the United States of America which makes it clear that the United States will eventually lake the same step as has been taken by the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia within the last 2 or 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that great advantages will flow to Australia, not only internally but externally.I sincerely hope the conversion will operate as smoothly as it is obviously operating in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and South Africa.I believe that with a Board  at  competent people as provided for in this Bill, and with theco-operation of many other people, including the public of Australia, the conversion can lead Australia into many savings in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is in accordance with the practice being adopted in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There have been a number of questions about the possible entry of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> into the European Economic Community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Lawrie  now has suggested that at any discussions between the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and countries of the Community, and where it is legitimate for Australia to do so, Australia should have an observer present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be appreciated, of course - I would assume this to be the case - that when the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> sat at the table with members of the Community for purposes of negotiation, the discussions would be a matter for the parties only and certainly not something at which outside observers would be encouraged to be present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I address a question to the Leader of the Government in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Industry, ls it not a fact that, because of either the lack of desire or the inability of the Egyptian Government to reopen the  Suez  Canal as an important shipping route, the South African ports of Capetown and Durban have become 2 very important ports in the trade lifeline between the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and this part of the world? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators look at the history of the present Government of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, which is rather in the news at this time, they will find that some most dramatic increases and drops have occurred in interest rates in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those increases and drops have been in accordance with what the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Government considered to be appropriate action to manage the economy of that nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators would have noted that as recently as 3 weeks ago the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Government was forced to intervene in relation to a pending visit  by a touring South African cricket team. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt had very sound reasons for doing this because, at the same time as this controversy was taking place in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> with the threat of demonstrations that would have seriously upset a tour by such a team, it was faced with holding the Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, lt is true to say that those Games would have been a complete farce if the South African cricket team had entered the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> to play on this tour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report shows total receipts to the Board of $197,714, against which there is expenditure of S83.940, for Australian administrative expenses, expenditure of $47,884 for administrative expenses in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and expenditure of $91,335 on the development of overseas markets and advertising, making a total expenditure of $223,160. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I must say that in common with the honourable senator I would have some concern about any proposal that an increase in shipping rates to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> would be taking place without very, very close and exact scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Wool Board has under its control some 280 wool stores which are a legacy of the wool purchasing arrangement between Australia and the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> which operated during the last World War. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700612_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So, the people of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> are to all intents and purposes disenfranchised as far as having any voice on the subject of Britain’s entry into the Common Market is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I repeat that although every political party contesting the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> general election on Thursday is in favour of Britain’s entry into the Common Market, gallup polls indicate substantial opposition to such a move. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report said that there is to be a freight increase - I cannot yet establish whether it is true or not - which would affect goods coming from the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> to Australia to the extent nf 12% but which would not affect goods going from Australia to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one looks at this morning’s Australian’ one will see that the shipping freight rates from England to Australia have already been increased by 12% and the shippers are now asking for a 12% increase in shipping freight rates from Australia to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Atomic Energy Commission sent twenty-two people to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Atomic Energy Authority several years ago to obtain experience in a number of areas, and for some of them to participate with the U.K.A.E.A. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is regrettably true that in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> there has been unemployment over a period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The announced withdrawal of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> forces has brought home to us the vulnerability of this ocean bordered as it is by some of the most populous countries in the world and some countries which are going through great economic, political and social change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> decision to withdraw, at the time it was announced by the previous <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Government, was one for the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> alone to make. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not believe that we can make any long term decisions based on the certainty of a continuing <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> presence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We would not do this alone but in conjunction wilh other powers such as the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and France, which has some interest in the Indian Ocean area, and perhaps the United States, which is showing an interest in the area although not a very strong one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition believes that the setting up of the telescope will be a very good example of cooperative arrangement between the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Government and the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700827_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps Government speakers will explain why Linus Pauling was allowed into Australia in 1964 from the United States of America perhaps to speak on an antiVietnam platform, why General Hugh Hester was allowed in in 1967 from the United States to speak on an anti-Vietnam platform, why Doctor Connor Cruise O’Brien was allowed in in 1968 from Ireland to speak on such a platform, why Felix Green was allowed in in 1968 from the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> to speak on such a platform, and why Professors Schiller and Whittaker were allowed in in 1969 to speak on anti- Vietnam platforms, and yet  Mr Dick  Gregory has been prevented from entering Australia in 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Other countries such as the United Slates, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and Canada would allow persons such as  Mr Gregory  to enter their countries, yet it is becoming the norm for Australia to refuse entry to such persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I read the facts, countries like Sweden, Germany, Denmark, the United States of America, the Netherlands, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and France have shown a tendency, in the gathering of revenue, to move towards the principle of indirect taxation, the principle of the user paying the tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government has been deceptive in the extreme in failing to advise not only our primary producers but all other people in the country of the consequences of the loss of our traditional markets in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> after the inevitable entry of that country into the European Common Market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> is an example. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Japan has become a very big market for Australia and has replaced the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> as far as our exports are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This charge is well below the charge which is imposed by the Corporation in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The service connection fee in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> has risen from $A43 to SA54 whereas the fee in Australia is to increase from $30 to $40. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Once again the charge in Australia is well below the charge which is imposed by the Corporation in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one further examines the situation in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> one will find that its postal service lost $A37m in 1969-70. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A significant point I wish to make is that if we were to work on the same basis and with the same returns as the Corporation in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> we would find that we would have to increase our charges greatly in order to obtain the same returns on the capital invested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, the users of postal and telegraph services in Australia would have to pay amounts far in excess of what they are paying at present for the services provided if the results of the operations of the Corporation in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> in its infancy are any guide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will recollect that in 1967 I raised this matter and dealt with it rather extensively on information that I sought and obtained with regard to the changes that had been taking place in the postal services of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700930_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think his answer was taken by everybody to be a criticism of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> representation in Peking and whether it is performing a useful function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: Is it not a fact that the Australian Government and the Australian Department of Trade and Industry have frequently used <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> representation in Peking to facilitate the present trading arrangements of the Australian Government with Red China, by which various officials of the Commonwealth Trading Bank and the Commonwealth Department of Trade and Industry have visited Red China, been welcomed there and arranged certain trade deals in respect of wheat and other commodities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it also a fact that most recently the Australian Government used the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> representation in Peking to ascertain the whereabouts of an Australian, Francis James, and sought the good offices of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> for Australian purposes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, in every modern society - in West Germany, France, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, the United States of America or Australia - governments are forced to seek the bulk of their revenue from consumer taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701016_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister explain how, in the wake of a much tighter screening of migrants from the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>,  Mrs Biggs  appears to be receiving special solicitude when financially she is fairly affluent due to her proceeds from a syndicated article capitalising on the exploits of her husband which resulted in the death in a much less affluent state of a British locomotive engine driver? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should the application of  Mrs Biggs  receive more sympathy from the Department of Immigration than another <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> deportation dispute in which the Department is embroiled which is based on an affair of the heart’ issue? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the suggestion that the Commonwealth Government may enter into a contract, perhaps a long term contract, for the sale of wheat to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture give an undertaking that no commitments for the sale of wheat, which represents the livelihood of our wheat growers, will be made without first securing the fullest advice of the Australian Wheat Board on all aspects of the proposals, as the sale of substantial parcels of wheat without the full knowledge and advice of the Board would represent a complete negation of the purposes for which it was established and render utterly valueless the placing of a majority of growers on the Board? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701022_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have heard from  Senator Poyser  from Geelong, a great authority on this subject about rural industries, about the European Economic Community and about the sugar industry, lt is a matter for the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> whether it enters the European Economic <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701022_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us understand one thing and understand it clearly: The historical basis for Australia’s rural industries was the production of cheap food for the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701022_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth Government has done all it can to point out to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and the countries of the European Economic Community the position which will be faced by the rural producers of Australia if the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> enters the European Economic Community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701022_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Postmaster-General noted reports in the Melbourne Press that Australian troops in Vietnam will be able to ring home at rates of $10.80 per 3 minutes plus $3.60 for each additional minute; if so, are these rates correct and why do they compare so unfavourably with rates to <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, $7.50; Canada and United States of America from $6.09 to $10.80; and Hong Kong and South Africa, $7.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As firefighters in countries such as New Zealand, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, the United States of America and Canada have full recognition as a national industrial organisation, does the Minister feel that it would be acceptable to the union and perhaps in the public interest if some legislative action were taken to correct this anomaly? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701027_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Estimates debate for the last 2 years, and again this year, I have commented on the fact that the Government was still making devaluation payments when obviously it was well known to all producers and all manufacturers that there had been a change in the value of sterling in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and now of the dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701027_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been a tradition in which we have had a trust with our mother country, that as part of the British Commonwealth, and previously part of the British Empire, we would be given a preference, as we have given a preference to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill will give effect to a policy broadly similar to that of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Cheques Act 1957 but modified to take into account views expressed by the Manning Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> a solution to the problem of unnecessary indorsement of cheques was attempted in the Cheques Act 1957. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before action was taken by  the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Government to introduce a Dill a private member’s Bill, was introduced which, wilh minor changes, was subsequently adopted by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> is, therefore, that the law does not appear to require the indorsement of any cheques but, as a res u 1 1 of the memorandum I have mentioned, bankers require indorsement of negotiated cheques and order cheques paid over the counter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The position is the same in New Zealand, where a Cheques Act along the lines of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Act has been enacted and a banking practice similar to that in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> has been adopted: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have ‘ dealt at some length with the reasons why this Bill provides a different solution from that which the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Act provides, lt will, however, provide the same practical benefits as a matter of law as are provided in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> by a combination of law and banking practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Also it is a continuation of the age long battle for superiority of the executive over Parliament or the Parliament over the executive, the lower house, the upper mass news media I see it is spoken of as being some new phenomenon, but if we look at the history of parliamentary government throughout the world - in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, the United States of America and all other countries with parliamentary governments - there has always been a battle between Parliament and the executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I am quite sure that my predecessor would have been aware that cigarette advertising on television has been banned in the United States since the beginning of this year, in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> for the last 5 years, and is also banned in Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, although cigarette advertising on television has been banned in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> for 5 years it is not clear that there has been in that country any decrease in the consumption of cigarettes, because the tobacco industry has been able to exploit alternative methods of advertis ing to offset the ban on television advertising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the normal method by which apples and pears are sold on the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, European and Asian markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are there any specific differences in the types of contracts negotiated between Australian exporters of apples and pears and Asian buyers as compared with <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> or European buyers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and European markets normal methods of disposal of apples and pears are by forward sale, sale afloat, free consignment, or on consignment against a guaranteed advance from an importer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Approximately 60 per cent of apples and pears are forwarded on consignment or against a guaranteed advance to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and European markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Forward sale contracts for the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and Europe differ from Asian contracts to the extent that the former would often cover a range of varieties of broader specifications probably shipped on more than one vessel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister for Supply, refers to the Woomera rocket range and the existing joint <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>- Australia Project Arrangement which expires in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710401_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: Is the current visit to Woomera by a House of Commons technical committee directly related to any decision which the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> might make in connection with the Arrangement, or is the visit likely to result in an increased workload at Woomera and the Weapons Research Establishment facility in Adelaide? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710401_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that the visit of this <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> delegation has not a direct realtionship to the continuation of the joint Arrangement between that country and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710401_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am very happy about the visitation because I think that the more <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> parliamentarians who see Woomera and gain an appreciation of what is being done there the better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710401_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can only say that the experience in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> is that the money that was spent on advertising before the ban came into force has been utilised in other ways such as a coupon system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710401_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Right Honourable Lord Shawcross, Q.C., a former Attorney-General of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, in an article published in 1966, expressed it thus: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A committee of English lawyers, amongst whom were the Right Honourable  Sir Derek  Walker-Smith, Q.C., M.P., and  Mr Charles  Doughty, Q.C., has quite recently expressed the same opinion concerning the law in force in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The committee recommended that the law in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> should be revised in order to simplify and clarify it, to help the authorities in maintaining order and to give participants in assemblies a greater understanding of their legal rights and liabilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present law is found in part in the common law, in part in old <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> statute law of considerable antiquity, dating back to riot legislation of 3394 in the reign of Richard II, and in laws of the States and Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As honourable senators will recall the Minister’s speech, the present law is found partially in the common law and partially in old <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> statute law of considerable antiquity, dating back to riot legislation of 1394 in the reign of Richard II. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For nearly 40 years the Tariff Board, in recommending protection, has had only 2 specific guidelines, both contained in commitments given in the 1932 and 1957 trade agreements with the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These were that protection would be afforded only to those industries reasonably assured of sound opportunities for success; and that protection would not exceed a level which would give the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> industry full opportunity for reasonable competition on the basis of the relative costs of ‘economic and efficient’ production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In order to consider those two aspects perhaps we should look to what was said by Lord Denning, one of the great law reformers in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, a judge very well known for his liberal and reforming zeal, in relation to this particular matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In every other State, in the Territories of the Commonwealth and in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, there are at least 3 Acts dating from 1394, 1411 and 1414 plus a variety of other legislation that has come down through the centuries, all still applying and all still able to be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But it is manifesting itself not only here but also in the United States of America, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, many parts of Europe and even in Japan, where the youth are protesting against their lack of national purpose and their lack of something in which to believe and for which to strive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Industry been drawn to a paragraph in a leading article in an Australian newspaper of today’s date to the effect that there are justifiable fears in the minds of the Japanese Government and of exporters that any foothold they have established in a particular segment of the Australian market can be capriciously closed by Australian vested interests - often United States or <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> owned companies - and the closure justified on the spurious ground of balanced development? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710430_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, the Minister advised me this morning of the details of the subsidy payments that are made by the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Government to British fishermen and some details of subsidy payments that are made by the Japanese Government to Japanese fishermen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, so far as the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Government is concerned, it would appear to me that subsidy is substantial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise what the Minister already told me about subsidies paid by the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Government to British fishermen and by the Japanese Government to Japanese fishermen, compared with the paucity of assistance given by the Australian Government to Australian fishermen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you realise that the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Government is subsidising its fishermen and that we are importing from that country some $6.5m worth of fish each year, that we are also importing each year from Japan some S9m worth of fish, you can see how difficult it is for the Australian fishermen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>In the House of Commons in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> this would be a common method of dealing with such an important Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My second point is that  Senator Sir Kenneth  Anderson was good enough to give me a very lengthy statement on our attitude to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Immigration Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>of the Bill, which does not in any way at all introduce some novel principle of law enforcement and is a common matter dating back many centuries and is well known in the law of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and of every State of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I spoke earlier of the fact that those words are incorporated in the codes of 3 of the States of the Commonwealth; they are incorporated in the common law of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>; they are incorporated through the common law into the law of the other 3 States of the Commonwealth; and they are included in the draft criminal code prepared by the Law Council of Australia, which, if  Senator Wheeldon  wishes to look it up, is Parliamentary Paper No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have dealt with every State of the Commonwealth of Australia and we have dealt with the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>; so let us have a look at Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because it seems that sufficient precedent is not to be found in the laws of the States of Australia, the draft territorial code, or the laws of Canada and the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, I thought I would look at the laws of New Zealand also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is common also to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, to Canada and to New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>I think there is a fairly general pattern in Australia, although probably the honourable senator could justify his position more readily in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The consent of the Attorney-General is required in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, for instance, in the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829; the Public Health Act 1875; the Geneva Convention Act 1911; the Agricultural Credits Act 1928; the Public Order Act 1936  -  I emphasise that Act because it has some relevance to this debate; the Public Utilities Street Works Act 1950; and the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Act 1951. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again I simply cite those Acts as an example of where the Director of Public Prosecutions in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> is the person who has the role of deciding whether a prosecution should proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s financial arrangements for the dairy industry for 1970-71 were based on production levels  of  220,000 tons for butter and 70,000 tons for cheese and it is disappointing that due to poor seasonal conditions, Australia has been unable to fulfil its <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> butter quota for 1970-71 and to take full advantage of opportunities offering in other markets due to the sudden change in the world market situation for dairy products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For a long while it has been a case of speculation whether the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> might join or be allowed to join the European Economic Community but it seems now that it will be a fait accompli in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been forcibly brought home to us that we must look for other markets and that the transition period is short - this is the period in which we can adjust our trade with the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, the European Economic Community and other areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Byrne  and I were able to go to Brussels and express our views to people who belong to both sides of the Parliament of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But Australia did emphasise, and has emphasised, that there will need to be a known transitional or access period during which our trading relations with the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> will be given special consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have told the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Government that we need a transitional period in which to adjust to the new situation inherent in that country’s entry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the United KingdomAustralia Trade Agreement will need to be phased out over a period so that the Agreement can be terminated without hindrance or hurt to Australia or Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> has a very large economic stake in Australia, as indeed she has in some of our neighbours such as Malaysia and Singapore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is significant that the Arrangements came into effect after the date on which the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Government decided by resolution of the Mother of Parliaments after the drama of a vote to go into the European Economic Community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had the opportunity to talk to parliamentarians from the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and from other nations that are members of the European Economic Community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I obtained the clear impression while there that although the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> desired to enter the Community it was not .coins to enter a closed shop, as it were, but that it was going to make a real contribution to the defence of Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clear view was expressed that Britain’s entry into the European Economic Community would strengthen the defence of Europe but never at any stage was it suggested in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> - rather it was to the contrary - by those for and against Britain’s entry that Britain’s ties with the Commonwealth ultimately would be given up; that its entry would mean separation from those ties of blood and brotherhood with Commonwealth countries such as Australia and New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They included Denmark; France; Iceland; Ireland; Israel - a country which we are told is under serious threat from the Communist conspiracy but which had no compunction in voting for the Albanian resolution; Italy; the Netherlands; Norway; Sweden; the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and Portugal - a remarkable addition to the list. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that  Senator Byrne  put forward the proposition that the European Economic Community was some form of conspiracy but rather he tried to argue, on a reasoned and logical basis, the import to Australia of the entry of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> to the EEC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said that, 1 wish to concentrate on the great significance of the historic and momentous decision of the House of Commons to take the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> :i-to the European Economic Community, lt was a decision which was momentous not only to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> but also, I suggest, to the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The significance of the entry of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> is, I believe, more in the political context than in the economic context. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear from  Mr Wilson  that he envisaged the entry of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> as a means of developing a greater and fuller Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Heath then went on to mention the great problems that faced the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> with which the House of Commons concerned itself but which could make little impact upon the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The significance of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> decision is that we now see being created in Europe a huge world ‘force, a new super power - indeed, it might be said, a power capable of exercising enormous economic, political and, if need be, military power in the world, lt will be a power equal to, if not greater than, that of the United States, of the Soviet Union, of the People’s Republic China, if it seeks to be a super power, and of Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts of life are that the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> with 55 million people could not play a part in world affairs, which she herself recognises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She is o longer able to exercise a major influence in the world, but there will be with the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, Denmark and other countries as part of Europe a community of 255 million people - a population far greater than that of the United States, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, 1 believe that the main significance of the entry of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> will be to bring into Europe outward looking influences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe that a significance of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>’s entry will be that Europe - one of the great trading blocs of the world - with outward looking policies will expand as a trading bloc and that it will expand its political influence beyond Europe into the outside world, including the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and in time throughout the eastern areas of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is why I have always believed the political aspect of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>’s entry to be more important than the economic aspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe that most European countries wanted the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> as a member of the Community, not for any economic reason but because of the political influence that she would wield - a political influence that would introduce into the Community outward looking influences with regard to the world situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I deplore calamity howling over the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>’s decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major issue is the decision by the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> to enter the European <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> alone has invested $2, 333m in this country in the last 10 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are in a financial position to withstand some of the problems of adjustment that the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>’s entry into the European Economic Community, without doubt, will force upon many peoples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators will know, our trading situation has declined markedly with the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, so much so that in 1959-60 we exported 26.4 per cent of our exports to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> but today the figure is 11.8 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1959-60 we imported 35.6 per cent, or one-third, of our imports from the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last year on record the European Economic Community was a bigger trading partner of this country than was the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our exports to the European Economic Community were greater than those to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although our dependence on the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> market has fallen dramatically from 26.4 per cent of our exports to 11.8 per cent of our exports, certain industries will have problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us not forget that we have a very favourable preferential tariff arrangement with the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> forces remain east of Suez and we are involved ourselves with other people in defence arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> as part of a greater Europe will be in a position to be a stronger friend than it has been in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with the Leader of the Government in the Senate  (Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)  and the Minister for Civil Aviation  (Senator Cotton)  that the undertakings entered into by the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> in this part of the world were given with the very best intentions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I cannot escape the feeling that the dwindling strength of that same <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> makes it arguable whether that could be accomplished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot escape the feeling that has been expressed by economists in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and by some members of the Labor Party in that country that because the centralising power in a federation or a confederation of nations, whatever one may call it, is overwhelming, there is the desire and the force to concentrate industries in the nations in the centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Industrial unrest in Britain has been largely responsible for bringing the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> to the pass in which it finds itself today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I noticed a report the other day which indicated that whereas the time lost through strikes in Australia last year increased by IS per cent the figure in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> in this respect increased by 60 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While entry into the EEC may not be a good thing for the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> economically and while it may be true, as  Mr Wilson  says, that the struggle is only just beginning, nevertheless if the guidance is forthcoming politically for the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> this could have long range effects upon the defence of this country and upon the peace of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to be hoped that the political influence of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> amongst the members of the European Economic Community will be such that the EEC can be built into a force in the world that will be a counterpoise to the forces of the two great communist blocs which I and a good many others believe threaten the security of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia for a long time past has had a most adverse trading balance with the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the trading balance between Australia and the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> is adverse to this country at the ratio of 2:1 or 2i:l. If that lost trade can be replaced and if trade can be encouraged with countries which will trade on a reciprocal basis, the trading relations of our country could gain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States and the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> are 2 countries with which Australia has had most adverse trading balances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> - readjusted its trade with Australia, in the Iona term Australia could profit bv the entry of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> into the European Economic Community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thereafter I went to France, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, Germany, Switzerland and Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some other countries, such as the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, the proportion is even higher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That IDA has been able to continue its lending activities since July has been largely due to the fact that a number of countries, including Canada, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, Japan and Yugoslavia, have responded to this request and agreed to make such voluntary contributions to IDA. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does the Prime Minister, in view of the statement attributed to the Minister for Trade and Industry, on his return from recent discussions with European countries and the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, that there does not seem to be very much reaction or consideration of Australia’s circumstances either in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> or Europe,  consider that Australia’s position has been prejudiced by the failure to discover the views of the Parliament on this matter of such critical importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> an assurance is given to an industrialist that any information that he provides will be kept secret if he so requests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>lt was made capable of operation in the form in which it was enacted because of the experience upon which we were able to draw in examining the enactment and the pattern of operation in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>think it should be recognised by those who would cynically challenge the Government’s intentions and sincerity that the Australian legislation is more drastic than is the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> legislation because the Australian legislation bans outright the practice of resale price maintenance and permits the Tribunal to grant exemptions, but only when the case has been proved to the satisfaction of that Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is not the pattern which prevailed in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I direct the attention of the Minister for Health to a statement made this morning in Sydney by  Mr W.  Parr, lecturer in charge of courses for teachers of the deaf at the Sydney Technical College, in which he contrasted the overall subsidy planned for hearing aids provided in Scandinavia, Holland and the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> with the comparatively little or nothing that is provided in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of this, $3, 134m came from the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> (47.6 per cent), $2,573m (39.1 per cent) from the United Slates and Canada, and $87 1m from all other sources combined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For United Slates corporations the attractions that Australia offered  were  clear from the fact that by the end of 1967 there were only 4 countries in the world - Canada, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, West Germany and Venezuela - where the book value of United States investments exceeded the amount invested in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Figures published by the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Board of Trade indicate that British direct investments in Australia increased by 65 per cent between 1.960 and 1965. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the previously agreed policy of seeking markets outside the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> so as not to be left without a viable market when the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> enters the European Common Market, the amount that Australia can be expected to ship to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> in 1971-72 will be about 9,000 tons as against a quota of some 67,000 tons that under other conditions we would ship to Great Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although the ability of many of the developing countries is less than that of developed markets such as the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> to pay for these products, nevertheless they offer excellent prospects as long term market outlets for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To instance that, point I remind honourable senators that it is estimated that in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, for example, because of the price increase that has been necessary in that country, about 25 per cent of the total butter market has been lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the past 10 years the dairying industry has been conditioning itself for the shock of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> into the European Economic Community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> has, of course, been one of Australia’s greatest selling markets over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that the very important decision has been made in principle by the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> to enter the European Economic Community at the end of this year the Australian dairying industry is confronted with a significantly different market situation from the one anticipated some years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The dairying industry in Australia knows that in all probability the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> market, which previously took up to 70,000 tons of its butter and about 11,000 tons of its cheese, will be completely lost to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I closed that part of my comments by saying that in the increasing independence of Australia, its increasing size and the increasing wish of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> to become part of the European community, we are thrown much more upon our own resources and the focus of Australian nationalism and Australia’s consolidated interest must increasingly reside in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is incumbent on those who would seek to exclude the applicability of these proviions to criminal proceedings to show where they have operated unfairly in the 6 or 7 years that they have been in operation in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and New South Wales and in the periods for which they have been in operation in the other States of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the Air Force Act of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> -  numerous offences committed in the face of the enemy, or treacherously or involving mutiny or sedition are made the subject of the death penalty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether  Senator Murphy  or  Senator James  McClelland knew it or not, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> has retained the death penalty for treason and for offences against the military law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, Canada and New Zealand have failed to take the blind plunge which the learned  Senator James  McClelland would urge us to take - that is, to repeal all laws that require the death penalty as a proper sustain ment of the laws of treachery and military law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Murphy  failed to refer to the fact that the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> still has not abolished the death penalty for treason or any other military offence, nor has Canada or New Zealand, T must say that I have some strength in suggesting to honourable senators that nothing  Senator Murphy  has yet adduced to us would advance the acceptance of proposed sub-clause (2. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I would point out that, although the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> has repealed the death penalty for civil offences, it has retained it for all military offences and treason, as have Canada and New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will have to accept some responsibility to assist if New Zealand’s difficulties become intolerable for her, as we are the only people who really have a self-interest in seeing that New Zealand is not destroyed in an economic sense by the enormously difficult problems - they are even greater than ours - that she will inherit from the change of marketing patterns in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before being able to answer the honourable senator’s question as to why the result in Australia is different from the result of an application for exemption in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, T would have to read that judgment and make my assessment in the light of the judgments here and there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have already indicated publicly that one step which would be taken very early by Australia would be the withdrawal of the preferences enjoyed by the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> on imports under by-laws in the Australian customs tariff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only exceptions will be where preferences are accorded on a range of specified items to those Commonwealth countries, such as Canada and New Zealand, with which Australia has bilateral preferential agreements, or where preferences are given to Papua New Guinea or, on a limited range of items, to former or existing dependencies of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the context of the process of review of the tariff one result will be the eventual elimination of margins of preference currently enjoyed by the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the subsidy was 33$ per cent it was determined on the price of ship construction in a <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> yard; but in the new scale of subsidy, the 45 per cent fluctuating scale, the basis of determination is the world price for ship construction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the surface the subsidy appears to have been increased from 331 per cent to 45 per cent on a fluctuating scale; but because the determination is based now on a world price for ship construction instead of the cost of ship construction in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, the shipbuilding yards could receive less in subsidy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whether you look at the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> where the gas industry is nationalised, or whether you look at the United States of America or Canada where the industry is under private enterprise, in all cases you will find a Federal or central authority of reference and decision which we in Australia seem to be lacking at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Perhaps it is reasonable to have first past the post voting in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and in the United States because in both countries there is voluntary enrolment and voluntary voting, but to suggest engrafting a first past the post system onto the Australian electorate which has compulsory voting and compulsory enrolment is in my view a phoney suggestion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>If anyone propounds the argument that we should use the first past the post system which is used within the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, and the United States, surely we must adopt the other 2 propositions also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The general opinion is that there is not likely to be any significant place in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> market for Australian butter and cheese in the enlarged EEC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The main problem will be to find outlets for butter in the limited markets outside the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But certainly in the early and middle 1950s we were rather attracted  -  1 think the Minister will recall this - to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> scheme of abatement on rural properties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not believe that the first past the post system in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> produces the result which is required in a democratic system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a single member constituency which is the traditional one under which our parliamentary democracy in the Westminster tradition has developed or there is the system which has its origin more on the continent of Europe than in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> of having a multi-member constituency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer the Senate to one of the considered works on the age of majority, namely, the Report of the Committee on the Age of Majority, known as the Latey Committee, which reported in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> in July 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A second factor involved is the acquisition of one of Australia’s 3 largest hide exporting companies by the British hides monopoly, Barrow Hepburn and Gale Ltd which owns nearly all the other tanning organisations in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the monopoly position and Australian interests of Barrow Hepburn and Gale Ltd, together with the Government’s refusal so far to curtail local hide exports, Australian tanners will face duties previously not experienced on their leathers entering the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> as well as undue competition from the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> in gaining its own raw material supply at a time of world wide shortage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following the statement of the Minister for National Development that a uranium enrichment plant is to be established in Australia, will the Minister give serious consideration to its establishment in South Australia, as that State had a successful uranium treatment plant some years ago until its contract with the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Government ran out and its Department of Mines was regarded very highly for its research on the treatment of uranium? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister for Health aware that aGoverment White Paper in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> revealed that 5,607,435 experiments were done on living cats, dogs and other animals in 1971- an increase of 25,000 over the 1970 figure - and that much scientific experiment is done simply for the sake of experiment and produces nothing of relevance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I must admit that when the honourable senator gave the figures in relation to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> he rather jolted me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These difficulties are certain to be accentuated when the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> is fully integrated into the European Economic Community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In spite of this those sectors of the fruit growing industry which have been supplying fresh apples and pears and canned peaches and pears to markets in Europe and especially the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> are now faced with a very severe over production problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Serious problems lie ahead in the light of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> entry into the European Economic Community and returns have been eroded by significantly higher costs particularly by drastic freight increases, just to mention some of a range of difficulties with which the industry is faced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am informed that at Heathrow Airport there is provision for 3 entry channels through which persons entering the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> may pass. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that Australian industry and commerce are amongst the most monopolised in the world, twice as much as in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and 3 times as much as in the United States of America according to Professor Wheelwright as at some years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this provision has been insisted on by the other countries - I think it was the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Government - we have no alternative but to go along with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I might put it in short form, if a person is extradited from Australia to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, for example, for a hijacking offence, he may be tried in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> for hijacking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The recent history of shipping fruit to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> from Tasmania has been one of endeavouring to arrange for a system which is the most efficient and provides the greatest returns to growers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Two of our largest markets have been in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those 2 markets are under threat because the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> is going into the European Economic Community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This last area is of some interest, especially in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I took the trouble to extract some information friom magazines and technical material that was available to me in respect of some of the measures that were taken in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> with regard to decentralisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I found that some of the measures in force to influence decentralisation of industry in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> were: 40 per cent cash grants for plant and machinery; 25 per cent building grants given to service industries as well as manufacturing; discretionary loans and grants, including the possibility that the Board of Trade in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> could subscribe to shares and stock; resettlement and removal grants for workers; grants to local authorities to rehabilitate derelict land and improve basic public services; controls on factory development in prosperous regions under industrial development certificates; and a wage subsidy of  1.10.0  as a regional development premium for each adult male manufacturing employee in the development areas for at least 7 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the main factors that militates against Tasmania’s development is the fact that so much of our exports, being primaryindustrial, have traditionally gone to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and to Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Notwithstanding lengthy dialogue on the position of Australian nationals entering the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> following Britain’s membership of the European Common Market, I ask: Could he ascertain from either the Prime Minister or the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether the evaluation of the White Paper which was recently delivered in Britain affects in any way his earlier answers to me? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that this is very drastic, but it irritates me and the Opposition that all these new types of oil tankers, in the countries where they are registered, such as the United States, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and France, usually have incorporated all the modern designs, including receiver tanks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Extradition (Foreign States) Act 1966- 1972, which this Bill proposes to amend, continued in force for the time being the old extradition arrangements with foreign countries that apply to Australia by virtue of treaties entered into by the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and of the old Imperial Acts known as the Extradition Acts, 1870 to 1935. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>May I indicate to honourable senators for their information that the Prime Minister some weeks ago announced that the Cabinet had authorised me to prepare a Bill for freedom of information, broadly following the concepts of the American Freedom of Information Act and to implement in Australia what was broadly then recommended by the Franks Committee in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, that is, to remove restrictions upon public servants and to clarify the areas in which they might not be permitted to speak out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I suggest to the honourable senator that one of the reasons for the falling off in the number of migrants coming from the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> to Australia this year compared with last year could be related to the economic circumstances of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> as affected by her joining the European Economic Community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such a view did the then Government take of the position that some primary industries were compensated on that account because of the intense competition and because of the difficulties experienced in exporting primary products to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-68">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 have indicated the traditional and accepted rule - applicable not only in the past in this country but also in the United States of America and the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> - that deportation or extradition does not take place where a person is likely to be dealt with for his political opinions by the country to which he is sent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#debate-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Basically, the revision was made necessary by changes since 1960 in Australian and New Zealand taxation laws but it also takes account of subsequent developments reflected in Australia’s more recent double taxation agreements, notably those with the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an objective actually achieved in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and in Australia and which has been regarded as being of great importance to the preservation of democracy in our type of country - a country such as Great Britain - a country such as Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is as yet, no formal request from the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> to do anything about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This derives from the extradition legislation which the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> I think commenced in 1870, which was developed by subsequent amendments up to 1935 and which still has some operation in this country insofar as treaty arrangements which were made under that legislation were retained and perpetuated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This growth was mainly attributable to an increase in exports to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, but a number of other markets shared in this increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He had to exercise very great political judgment in matters which arose affecting the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, the whole conduct of the war and also Australia’s position in the war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By way of preface I refer to a lengthy answer he gave me to a question I asked about the status of Australians in Britain under the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Immigration Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, Australia and  Her  other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It still contains the special references, and in fact gives first place, to the  Queen’s title  as Queen of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had earlier discussed it with the Lord Chancellor, Lord Hailsham; the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Offices,  Sir Alec  Douglas-Home; and the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Attorney-General,  Sir Peter  Rawlinson, Q.C. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The outcome of the discussions in London is that the Australian Government will introduce a Bill as soon as possible requesting and consenting to the enactment of <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> legislation abolishing appeals to the Privy Council in the remaining instances in which appeals still lie from Australian courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I accordingly took the matter up with the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> takes the view that the question whether appeals should be brought to the Privy Council from the courts of a Commonwealth country is essentially a question for the Commonwealth country concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it correct to say that the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> would wish moreover that whatever can be done in and by Australia should be done in and by Australia herself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One way of proceeding is for the Australian Government and Parliament to request and consent to the enactment of <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is no challenge, or if in the event of challenge the validity of the legislation is upheld, the Australian Government would expect the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Government to introduce into the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Parliament the legislation requested by the Australian Government and Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In each of the 4 areas in which I stopped, the South Pacific, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, Italy and Mauritius, I was able to outline the general direction of the Government’s foreign policies and the more independent stance we are taking in 4 diverse and widely separated areas of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are also long-standing reciprocal social security benefits rights for Australians in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Commonwealth Government propose to interfere in any way with the existing relations between the Australian States and the Sovereign and also the existing relations between the Australian States and the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Government and the Parliament at Westminster? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite plain that the aim of the Australian Government is that no external court should deal with domestic Australian cases whether they come from State courts or from Federal courts - that no such cases should be determined ultimately by somebody outside Australia, not responsible to Australia, not appointed by Australia and in fact acting in relation to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Government itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third part of the honourable senator’s question dealt, I think, with the relationship of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Parliament and the Australian States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I do not see it spelt out, there is little doubt that we take the view that in no way should Australia be subordinate to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Independence of Australia that the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Parliament should in any way be able to legislate in regard to Australia or any part of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the intention would be quite clear - let there be no doubt about that - that we would think it quite inconsistent with the independence of Australia that the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Parliament would continue to have legislative authority over Australia or any part of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me, the reason why it did occur is that in New Zealand, Australia, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and the United States of America a change in foreign policy occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other parts of Indo-China had been cut up between the great colonial powers, including the old <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, the great empire of yesteryear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These include institutions which are specifically involved in assistance to small business, such as the German Management and Productivity Association (RKW) of the Federal Republic of Germany; the Small Business Administration of .the United States; the Smaller Enterprise Agency of Japan; and the industrial liaison scheme in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Steps have been taken or are about to be taken - if they have not been initiated they should have been - to renegotiate the agreements with the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are reciprocal arrangements with the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, Italy, Greece, Malta and Turkey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, there are long-standing reciprocal social security benefit rights for Australians in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, a reciprocal agreement - this was not done by legislation - was entered into between the governments of Australia and the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> in 1954. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can pick up a newspaper and read that in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> people are thinking seriously about reintroducing the death penalty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the reference to Imperial Acts is removed, the situation which existed before the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs looked at this matter will be sustained, and that will have the effect that the various provisions of the Army Act of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and the Naval Discipline Act of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> would not apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, me Defence Act of Australia creates certain offences by way of adapting to the purposes of the Australian defence Forces the provisions of the Naval Discipline Act of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and the Army Act of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By virtue of section 34 of the  Naval  Defence Act, the Naval Discipline Act 1957 of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, subject to adaptations, is applied in the Royal Australian Navy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 8 of the Air Force Act applies to the Royal Australian Air Force the Air Force Act 1939 of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, as adapted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a definite tendency today, both in the United States and in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, for a reversion to capital punishment because of the increase in crime and because so many people in the community pay so little regard to human life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  President  of the United States has called for the restoration of capital punishment and in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, although the parliamentarians once again squibbed it as they so often do on issues they are afraid of - many of them are weak when it comes to grasping that nettle firmly - there is a rising demand for the restoration of capital punishment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What scares me about this proposition is that we could arrive at the position that has been arrived at in the United States of America and the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, where the death penalty has been abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been some agitation in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> for the return of the death penalty, particularly for the killing of policemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will go down the scale, as the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and the United States have done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the first release by the British Home Office of a report stating that 123 Australians had been directed to leave at the end of a period of 12 months, could I have a breakdown of the various groups involved and the specific reasons why they were -ordered to leave the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Pensions paid to Australian residents by overseas Governments or other Institutions, whether in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> or elsewhere, are of course liable to change in terms of their Australian dollar value if the exchange rate between the currency of the country concerned and the Australian dollar changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should mention that, as a result of the recent exchange rate changes, some persons resident in Australia in receipt of a pension from the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> could have become eligible foran Australian Social Service pension for the first time and others could have qualified for an increased Social Services pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This situation has been in operation for a long time in the Mother of Parliaments in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> found these arrangements very suitable and I see no reason why we in Australia should not do the same thing and have longer periods between redistributions with a bigger margin of tolerance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The preference system which is illegal in the United States of America and the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> does not give the best result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There would be a multiplicity of small parties owing no allegiance one to the other, changing their position within the Parliament, serving their own narrow purposes, frustrating the continuity of government and destroying what we have become used to in Australia and in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, that is, the 2-party system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The same first past the post system in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> reduced the once great Liberal Party in that country to a party comprising 11 members in a House of approximately 600 members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It continued until there evolved a system in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> under which there were only 2 parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> it is hard to imagine such a system when comparing the number of electors who voted for a particular party with the number of members of that party who were elected to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been demonstrated as being imperfect in this country, and it has been demonstrated as being imperfect in all the other countries which have so called representative government - the United States, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, Ireland and other places that have been mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the United States, I believe, it is as high as 6 to 1 in favour of rural areas, and in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> a similar situation obtains. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is important to end the confusion which has been permitted to continue since the Citizenship Act of 1949 and the use of terminology which has given many Australian the mistaken impression they are not only Australian citizens but also citizens of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is one area in which I am at great variance with the Government which has so rapidly and so ruthlessly cut off to a large degree old and proven associations with the United States of America, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and other allies and adopted so definitely new policies in which those who follow other than our democratic system of government have been paramount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although at present a  12  mile limit seems to be most widely favoured, Australia still asserts a  3  mile claim, as do the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, the United States and a number of other major countries, and Australia is therefore not bound to recognise wider claims by other states. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whether yon look at the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> where the Gas Industry is nationalised, or whether you look at the United States of America or Canada where the Industry is under private enterprise, in all cases you will find  a  Federal or central authority of reference and decision which we in Australia seem to be lacking at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As one who served on the Senate Select Committee on Off-shore Petroleum Resources for quite some time I was heartened to hear  Senator Wright’s  reference to the Committee’s report, particularly to the in-depth inquiry and study which the Committee made regarding the transmission of hydrocarbons in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, Italy, Canada and the United <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are things that can point to the way in which the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and the United States of America have had short term experience of these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Why did the United States and the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> introduce short term policies with regard to prices and incomes? ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I recall the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> found that the inflationary trend did not change significantly by instituting measures similar to those we are discussing at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would have been far more honest if the Labor Government had said to the people of Australia: We will try to solve the problem by doing half of what the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and America tried’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can do that, but it does not in any way do what the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and the United States of America did, that is, to freeze both wages and prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What they will really do is use this device in a discriminatory way to say to particular sections: ‘We will delay your putting up of prices for a period of 3 or 4 months’ which is, of course, a price freeze, lt is important to keep in mind, if anyone sees any virtue in this, that the price freezes, and wage freezes, that were imposed by both America and the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> failed entirely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Nowhere in the world have these kinds of mechanisms succeeded; nor have the freezes that have been imposed in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What the Scotton and Deeble report simply facilitates in a mechanistic way is the bringing into Australia of the kinds of national schemes which have been tested in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, Scandinavia and Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> where the hospitals and the doctors were nationalised more, and more people are getting together to build private hospitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> the scheme on hospitals which is devised in that report is failing badly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Notwithstanding the long range plans for an international conference of nations adjacent to large fishing- areas, can we have an assurance that if North Atlantic Treaty Organisation contingencies result in Iceland obtaining a more favourable formula from its cod war with the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, Australia would use such a precedent in its future fishing relations with its competitors in adjacent Australian fishing waters? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Carr the British Minister responsible for <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> citizenship status in relation to Britain’s entry into the European Common Market indicated that even with the best intentions in the world the old links with Australia and New Zealand, and probably to a lesser degree Canada, were not quite the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I may quote the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Grassby)  on this point, other countries which do not require a person to renounce their allegiance to their country of origin encompass New Zealand, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, France, Israel, Ireland, Italy, Japan and the Netherlands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I mentioned at the second-reading stage of the Bill, other countries, including New Zealand and the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, do not expect people acquiring their citizenship to renounce their countries of origin or their relationships to those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whereas the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania, humbly relying on the blessing of  Almightly  God, have agreed to unite in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth under the Crown of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> of Great Britain and Ireland and under the Constitution hereby established . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Crown is the symbol of the true association of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and as they are united by a common allegiance to the Crown it would be in accord with the established constitutional position of all the members of the Commonwealth in relation to one another that any alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne or the Royal Style and Title shall hereafter require the assent as well of the Parliament of all the Dominions as of the Parliament of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I turn now to the covering clauses of the Australian Constitution because my proposition is this: That the oath of allegiance must be an oath personalised to the British Sovereign, to the sovereign of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> personalised by name, and that merely to make the oath of allegiance to the office of the Queen of Australia is something which this Parliament is not constitutionally competent to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In other words the propositions put forward so far to the Senate are that the Queen is the Queen of Australia in right and title of her Queenship of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>; that any law that we enact here must be in terms of the law enacted in the Australian Constitution Act and the Australian Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He strongly advocated that the better approach was to begin in the territorial reference by referring to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and then to refer to Australia in the case of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that juristically speaking it would be fantastic to eliminate a reference to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> because the plain truth is that  Her  Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second sits on the throne not because of some law of Australia but because of the law of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He said that in the literal, legal sense the Queen is the Queen of Australia because she is Queen of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Menzies  added that in strict terms of law  Her  Majesty is our Queen because under the Act of Succession of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, as modified by the Abdication Act of 1 936, she is Queen of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dr Evatt  when speaking on the Royal Style and Titles Bill 1953 reminded the House of Representatives that in the preamble to the Statute of Westminster 193 1 there was a declaration that alterations of the law touching the succession to the throne or the royal style and title required the assent of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Parliament and the parliaments of all dominions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister was quite correct in pointing out that, so far as Australia is concerned, in both constitutional practice and constitutional law in the strict sense, the succession is determined by the Succession to the Throne of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, they project the firm opinion that the entitlement of  Her  Majesty the Queen to the Queenship of Australia arises and stems from  Her  Queenship of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important part of that last reference is that  Dr Evatt  contemplated the inclusion of the words ‘Elizabeth the Second’- a personalisation again of the monachy which he and  Mr Menzies  obviously considered as indispensible because, as I have said, the Queenship of Australia arises from the personal Queenship of the Queen as Queen of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The provisions to this Act referring to the Queen shall extend to Her Majesty’s heirs and successors in the sovereignty of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is in the right and title of her queenship, her sovereignty, of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore when the Senate insists, as  Senator Davidson  proposes, on the amendment as originally proposed and rejected by the House of Representatives, I submit, on the authorities which I have quoted and on the recitation of the history of the constitutional position, that the amendment reflects the constitutional position in the personalisation of the Queen in her right and title as sovereign of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It meets the constitutional demand that we accept, that is, that Queen Elizabeth is Queen of Australia in her right and title as Queen of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Royal Style and Titles Act 1953 the oath of allegiance referred to ‘Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, Australia and  Her  other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The omission of ‘renouncing all other allegiance’ is maintained because, as I have said already, it has no legal purpose and it could be equally distressing to citizens of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> as well as to citizens of other countries, all of whom will be required to take the oath or affirmation of allegiance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Significantly the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and Canada are among the great majority that do not require an act of renunciation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I attempted to make in my submission was this: The Queen is Queen of Australia only insofar as she is Queen of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She derives the title ‘Queen Elizabeth the Second ‘ from her monarchy in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister was quite correct in pointing out that so far as Australia is concerned in both constitutional practice and constitutional law in the strict sense the succession is determined by the succession to the throne of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In other words, the learned doctor was there predicating that it is as Queen of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> that the Queen becomes Queen of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not necessary to insert the words of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>’ because in describing her as Queen Elizabeth the Second, ipso facto, she is Queen of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and Queen Elizabeth the Second of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Territories dependent on the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> include the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, Australia and  Her  other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas it was recited in the preamble to the Statute of Westminster, 1931 that it would be in accord with the established constitutional position of all the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations in relation to one another that any alteration in the law touching the Royal Style and Tides should, after the enactment of that Act, ‘require the assent as well of the Parliaments of all the Dominions as of the Parliament of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>’: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And whereas the Style and Titles appertaining to the Crown at the time of the enactment of the Statute of Westminster, 193 1 had been declared by His then Majesty King George V. in a Proclamation in pursuance of the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act, 1927 of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, and were, in consequence of the establishment of the Republic of India, subsequently altered with the assent as well of the Parliaments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa as of the Parliament of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite apparent from the preamble to which I have referred that any further change, any alteration in the law touching the royal style and titles, would require the assent of the parliaments of the dominions and of the Parliament of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only other alteration which is to be made is that the words ‘of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> ‘ are to be removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The words ‘of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> ‘ are to be left out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that constitutionally some point may be raised that because the Australian Constitution defines the monarch as ‘the Queen of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>,  Her  heirs and successors according to law’ we ought to retain in our royal style and titles provision the reference to Queen Elizabeth the Second of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is that the person who occupies the dignity of the Queen of Australia is  Her  Majesty, her heirs and successors, according to the law of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and the Act of Succession of 1 707. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I strongly advocated- and as honourable members will see it turned out at any rate in the case of four of the countries concerned- that we ought in the territorial reference begin by referring to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and then to refer in our own way to Australia, in the case of Australia, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why refer to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> first?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place I think that, jurisstically speaking, it would be fantastic to eliminate a reference to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, because the plain truth is that  Her  Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second sits on the throne not because of some law of Australia but because of the law of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, in the literal, legal sense the Queen is Queen of Canada and of South Africa and of New Zealand, and so on, because she is Queen of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, as I say, in strict terms of law  Her  Majesty is our Queen because under the Act of Succession of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, as modified by the Abdication Act of 1936, she is the Queen of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of this Act referring to the Queen shall extend to Her Majesty’s heirs and successors in the sovereignty of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that the Queen, in the terms of the Constitution Act and our Constitution, is the Queen according to the law of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the reason why I say irrespective of how, under the royal style and titles, we may describe  Her  Majesty, she is Queen of Australia by virtue of the fact that she is Queen of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is no obligation in Australia to refer to  Her  Majesty as the Queen of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The juristic position which was accepted in 1953 is, I believe, quite adequately maintained by the reference to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second because she is Queen Elizabeth the Second of the United Kingdomthere can be no mistake about that- and that adequately conveys the connection with the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in reply- It was interesting to listen to the distinguished  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in the Senate  (Senator Greenwood)  go to some pains to tell us that the Queen of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and the person who is part of the Parliament of Australia really owes her position in no way to us; she is properly there by virtue of the decisions of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>; she is the Queen of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and she is there irrespective of anything that we might do, say, want or wish; this is because of the carryover of the feudal system in Great Britain; although this is so, there is nothing that we can do about it; whether it is foisted upon us or tolerated by us we can properly describe her as the Queen of Australia, although we have nothing to do with her appointment, her being there or her moving; and we in no way have any effect on her being there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition seems to have been at great pains to say that in no way is the authority of the Queen, who is a constituent part of the Parliament of the country, to govern derived from the people of Australia but is derived only from the people of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Greenwood  said-  Senator Byrne  agreed with him- that the authority of this important person, the Queen, derives absolutely entirely from the people of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>; in no way does her authority to govern derive from the will of the people in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understood  Senator Byrne,  he said: ‘Let us not talk about that, but let us say that it is because the British people enshrined their will in an Act of Parliament which binds us and that we should ignore the proposition, which is put so clearly by the official Opposition, that the authority to govern comes from the will of the people of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and in no way from the will of the people of Australia ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I would not doubt that the proposition that the authority of the Queen comes entirely from the people of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and in no way from the people of Australia would probably be accepted generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-He applauded the existing state of affairs and said that the authority of the Queen to rule Australia came entirely from the will of the people of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and in no way from the will of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It now falls to the Senate in 1973 to deal with the present descendant of the feudal system in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> which is at the other end of the earth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose it is important whether we will drop the words ‘Defender of the Faith’ and whether we shall use the term ‘Queen of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> of Great Britain and Ireland ‘ rather than the term ‘Queen of Australia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposition we have suggested here is that the Consitution and the law- the Acts Interpretation Act, Statute of Westminster and so onrequire that the Queen shall be referred to by her personal title as Queen Elizabeth the Second because it is due to the sovereignty of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> that she sustains her title as Queen of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister for Primary Industry indicate whether the British Minister was able to give assurances of continuing markets for Australian products, particularly dried and fresh fruits, in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The essence of those discussions, in the light of the honourable senator’s question, was that the market prospects are good in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> for Australian primary products, particularly meat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generally, I would say yes, the Minister was confident that the future for Australian primary products in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> is looking good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They demonstrate that in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> per head of the total population about one person in 70 is employed in the public service, in Canada the figure is 1 in 30, and in Australia it is 1 in 11. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was suggested at that time that the reason why English institutions and private holders of stocks such as shares in Broken Hill Pty Co.

    <p>It is apparent that the prices policy, which is generally the language used to describe the type of policy which the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> legislature passed, is a policy which applies to goods, charges and services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Throughout the world- in America, in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and in other places where these powers have been given- almost without exception the dual power has been the one which has been exercised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be that if this were here alone the view would be taken that not enough legislative power was being given to the Australian Parliament; but it must never be forgotten that that is all we are dealing with- power in the Parliament to be able to legislate on this subject matter, to do what the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Parliament does as of course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is simply a matter of giving this Parliament the power which would exist in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Parliament and which exists in the State parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia’s independence of policy and action had been traded away for ‘defence on the cheap’- yet its closest allies, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and the U.S., were withdrawing into low profiles’ on the understandable premise that their friends should be as ready to defend their own freedom as we had been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The view which the advisers are giving the Government is based on intelligence reports from the United States and the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, already this year a platoon of the 6th RAR has visited the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, 150 soldiers have visited the New Zealand defence forces and members of the 6th Task Force have visited Hawaii for exercises with the United States 25th Infantry Division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since July 1 97 1 imports of veal and beef in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> have been subject to the application of levies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These levies are determined by the relationship of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> market price for fat cattle with the target indicated price- the TIP as it is called. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This works in this way: If in any week the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> market price is below the target indicated price levies are to be put into operation the next week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once that fall occurs in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, Australian beef and veal going to that country could be subject to that levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It retained its original title through 4 amendments between 1909 and 1952, but by 1957 the post World War II expansion of Australian diplomatic representation was reflected in a change of name to the High Commissioner (<span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will not read what he said, but his general comment was that the various Acts of Parliament of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> passed during the nineteenth century gave each State the power to make laws for the peace, welfare and good government of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that it is in the same condition as was the United States when it was first settled and had to get capital from the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and western Europe until its industrial generation was such and its population had grown to such an extent that the capital flowed the other way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By way of further elaboration ofthe foregoing explanation it should be said that changes in the relative values of major currencies, including the devaluation of the United States dollar and the floating by the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> of the pound sterling which are two of Qantas’ largest markets, has resulted in a decline of approximately $A 1 3m in the company’s revenue from air travel sold in foreign countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is relevant to mention that Australians are among the few travellers and shippers in the world who are paying the same fares and rates as last year whereas fares and rates in some countries, of which the United States and the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> are prime examples, have increased by more than 10 per cent as a result of currency changes and general fare increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This year fares sold in the United States for travel to Australia have increased by 10 per cent and <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> pound sterling fares have increased 6 per cent with the further 4 per cent to be added in November to normal fares for travel originating in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The cost of an excursion fare purchased in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> for travel to Australia has risen from pounds sterling 326.65 to pounds sterling 359.35 since May 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These problems derive principally from the large volume of exports which the industry has traditionally sent to markets in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general uncertainty created by these developments is aggravated by difficulties in the field of shipping, chiefly the high and increasing level of freight rates to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and Europe and the difficulty of finding adequate shipping for the purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although all States have some interest in export, the position is most serious for Tasmania, because of its heavy dependence on the export trade and on the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and Europe to take the bulk of its apple exports, and because of its dependence on conventional shipping. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> the penalty imposed for breach of the requirements in respect of proper conservation of fishery resources is a fine of 500 pounds, or $A820, as well as the court’s having a discretion to order forfeiture of the catch and fishing equipment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has proved to be so in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, the United States, and no less so in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government invited experts from the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> to come to Australia to advise it on health matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sir Lionel  Whitby, in an editorial in the Medical Journal’ of 3 July 1948, on the eve of the introduction of the national health scheme in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, summed up the position very well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is probably correct to say- although I have not got the figures- that the large majority of British subjects in this country have come from the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for the first and main part, the difficulties which the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> is facing, I would think that it would be hardly appropriate for Australia to initiate discussions about what are obviously the very severe problems which the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> is encountering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister give me some information on the position relating to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and Commonwealth country migrants as far as Australian citizenship is concerned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it not beyond argument that the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> has been brought to a condition bordering on anarchy and perhaps dislocation as an economic unit, with portents of massive unemployment, by industrial chaos fostered by ultra-militant trade unionism? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suppose it is interesting to compare the situation in Australia under a Labor Government with the situation in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> which does not have the benefit of a Labor government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As for the prophecies of doom for the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, I think that the people of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> will, as they have in the past, overcome their troubles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that the Government and the people of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> will solve their problems in their own way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The problems of these industries have been accentuated by the entry of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> into the European <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to a medical graduate who is trying to do some research work in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I was in London recently I was surprised to find that one of the most eminent professors of pediatrics in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and in fact in the world was virtually trying to raise money from notable people in London in order that an Australian medical graduate should be able to undertake research at Kings Hospital in London. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts of this case are that this person is a young doctor who wants to go to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> to study for 12 to 18 months in a very highly technical field of pediatrics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people of Great Britain have had to call on a Labour Government to get them out of the mess into which the equivalent in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> of honourable senators opposite have got them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As you know, because of my constitutional duties which relate to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, I must, after opening our Parliament here today, return immediately to London. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very fine to have kick at the Government about this matter, but it should be remembered that Australia still has a private enterprise economy, as have the United States, New Zealand, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and the European common market countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By comparison with the system that operates in New Zealand and the system that operates in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, the Australian democratic system as it is applied to this Federal Parliament is as near perfection as democracy can attain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Each public servant who puts a.foot outside his own town or city on official business is entitled to first class air travel- unlike the United States, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, New Zealand and many other countries where only very senior officers are entitled to travel first class, with economy class travel provided for other members of the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I call to mind that some years ago I went on a Commonwealth parliamentary tour to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am one of those people who believe that one of the things that has brought down the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> to its present level has been the nationalisation of vital industries in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that one of the big factors which has brought the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> to the condition in which it is today has been nothing more or less than the exploitation brought about by these nationalised industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that the Government can do is to hurry helterskelter along that same path to bring about in this country the same conditions as have operated in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eventually it will bring us to the same condition as that to which it has brought the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-About 12 months ago the British Broadcasting Corporation adopted a public access arrangement which has been very well received in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since the preparation of our legislation the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Government has announced proposals for the establishment of a Government authority and  Mr Trudeau,  the Canadian Prime Minister, is planning to introduce legislation shortly to create a national petroleum corporation whose objectives are remarkably similar to those in relation to petroleum proposed for the Petroleum and Minerals Authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has also accepted a proposal for the acquisition of 45 modern fire support vehicles by mating the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> manufactured Scorpion turret to the armoured personnel carriers already in Army inventory; the Army has adequate armoured personnel carriers for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It must rely on bigger countries like the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and the United States of America to come to its aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sincerely trust that we will not do anything to stop America coming to our aid because at the present time the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> is in such a spot I do not think that it could even supply enough fuel for a warship to travel from that country to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us look at the scheme in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> has had a national health scheme for something like 30 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have met hundreds of people from the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> who have come out here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have never met one migrant from the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> who has criticised the scheme which operates in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that scheme is as bad as  Senator Little  tries to make us believe it is, it is a wonder that when there has been a change of government in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>- there have been many changes of government over the last 30 yearsthe Conservatives, as one of their first actions when elected to Government, did not change the national health scheme to some system that they support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the scheme in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> has remained unchanged for more than 30 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I quote to the Senate that in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> the standard medical journals have stated repeatedly over the past year quite unchallenged that the average time made available by a general practitioner under the national health scheme to see a patient is of the order of 3 minutes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The hospital scheme in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> is breaking down under a long waiting list of patients, and waiting time for ordinary surgeryhernias, hysterectomies- is a year to 18 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> has it, and so too do the Governments of France, Italy, Norway, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, South Africa, Iran, Iraq, India, Japan, Indonesia, New Zealand and the Philippines, to name only some of the governments which have thought it desirable to have government participation in this industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us have regard to the fact that in other countries in which we have accepted that there are democratic systems- countries such as Canada and the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>- there are far greater disparities in the sizes of electorates than those which exist in the Commonwealth Parliament at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One would hope that the nations which have special rights under the constitution of 1960- namely, Greece, Turkey and the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>- play their part responsibly and hold themselves in great restraint during what must be a tremendously difficult time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let nobody fail to note what happened in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> in recent days when trade unions said they would starve patients out of private wards to enforce standard wards upon the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This practice which occurred in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> the other day was characterised by trade unions saying: ‘We will starve private ward patients out of private wards to force them into standard wards.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> at the present time a massive injection of funds is necessary to prevent the health scheme from collapsing financially. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a scheme has operated in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> for a quarter of a century but there the authorities are reviewing the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> there is a tendency towards a growth in private insurance organisations and an increasing number of people who are wanting anxiously to insure themselves in a fund through which they may seek private attention and obtain it almost immediately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have here an interesting supplement to the London ‘Times’ dealing with health care in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, published only a few months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not wish to hold up the Senate but I would like to read one or two extracts from the supplement that seem to indicate that the health scheme in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> has not been what Minister Bevan thought it ought to be when it was created that long ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems quite obvious to me that there is a growing demand iri the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> for private insurance protection in order that people may attend the doctor of their choice and can be sure that they will have that doctor available for surgical treatment or whatever treatment may be indicated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> taking 10,000 people as a basis there are 12 doctors, 32 nurses and 41 beds available for that number. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After 25 years of experience in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> it can be seen that a change is taking place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I believe what I read in that newspaper because it substantiates the views that have been put to me by doctors who have come to Australia to escape this public service environment and it has also been put in letters which I have received over the years from hundreds of patients who believe that the system in Australia is far from preferable to the one that they experienced for many years in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in recent times there has been an upsurge in the discontent amongst the doctors in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and a tendency for more and more doctors in that country to want to go overseas to practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> found it necessary to legislate against such practices with, I understand, very satisfactory results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>State governments can confirm- and it is evidenced by the most recent 50 per cent increase in hospital charges- that hospital costs are running away in this country under the present scheme and at a much faster rate, as it happens than in Canada or the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> or the United States of America against which unfavourable comparisons are so often made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wonder whether the sorts of considerations which are set out from page 179 onwards in chapter 12 of the report of the Donovan Commission- the royal commission on trade unions and employers associations conducted from 1965 to 1968 in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>- such as of the two types of multi-unionism and the problems which arise in trying to make a major change in the basic structure of trade unionism as it has been operating for some time, would indicate that it would be more desirable at least to hear a great deal more public debate taking place in the country, not with a view to destroying trade unionism in any way or for the purpose of union bashing but with a view to asking: How could they fulfil the accepted role more satisfactorily without the sorts of problems which exist and which are exemplified in the approach of the Government, which is saying at the moment that this Bill is necessary to overcome those problems, and the approach of the Opposition, which says that the present provisions will assist in overcoming the problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a serious mistake, which British economists are only too prone to make, to view the recent inflation in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> as a unique problem in this country, to be explained by unique domestic factors and required to be handled by unique domestic measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It must be realised that the activities at Woomera are largely related to the requirements of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, which is our partner in the project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741017_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact it depends largely on the negotiations between our Government, the Department of Defence and the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741017_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may well be that, resulting from those discussions and negotiations with our <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> partners, we will not take any action which will prevent the range from being re-activated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741017_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clear position is, as everybody knows, that unless there is a consistent involvement by the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> in the use of the range project the Government will have to spend many millions of dollars to keep it in the state of activity that we are used to and that we have liked in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741017_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator will recall that in the previous reply of the Minister for Defence about Woomera, which I restated in the Senate, we pointed out that the future of Woomera still depends on the requirements of our partner in this venture, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While it has been decided to apply the present policy we must still find out the future requirements of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I will try to find out from the Minister for Defence whether any negotiations between Australia and the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> will result in increased activity to the extent that the Government may have to change its policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Finer Commission which examined divorce practice in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> reached the conclusion that we can expect at least 1 5 per cent and possibly 25 per cent of all marriages to end in divorce from now on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That 780m was extracted from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> because the House voted for it notwithstanding its own estimates committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, about a week or 10 days ago I received from the Minister a long letter in which he explained that he had taken all of my representations into account and that after giving due consideration to the matter he had decided to allow these people to come from the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> to Australia on a second assisted passage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that arrangements would be made for his Department to get in touch with the family in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, and that in due course arrangements would be made for the family to travel to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The association between Rauwolfia derivatives and breast cancer was first drawn to the Committee’s attention late in September 1974 following publication in the ‘Lancet’- 21 September issue- of the results of 3 epidemiological studies, one based on United States hospital admissions, another on Finnish data, and the third on <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> data. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am told that in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> the Divorce Reform Act of 1969, which was activated in 1971- comparatively recentlyprovides that after the commencement of the Act the sole ground for divorce shall be that the marriage has broken down irretrievably. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, it is fair to say that since it passed through the House of Representatives many of us had a number of representations on this Bill from various legal people, from quite a lot of financial people and from one or two associations of people involved in trade, in particular in the area of trade between Australia and the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, and quite a number of us have discussed this Bill with these various people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A guarantor, an insurance company, in those circumstances may well feel that it has adequate redress in the case of a foreign resident or a foreign company by a right of action in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, the United States of America, or some European or Asian country; but if as a result of the Bretton/Woods agreement- the International Monetary Agreements Act- that person cannot enforce his rights in those countries, what we are doing by way of legislation here will prejudice a guarantor, an insurance company, in that position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We can do things in Australia without being the sort of derivative society that we were under the Liberal-Country Party Government that borrowed all its ideas from the United States of America or the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In some areas proposals have recently been made in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and some of those proposals have commended themselves for inclusion in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That whereas the Governments of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, United States of America, Canada and many European countries have not recognised the unlawful annexation of the Baltic States- Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia- by the Soviet Union, the Prime Minister of Australia has authorised the de jure recognition of this annexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister obtain an up to date assessment of the number of Australians who sought mediation by Australia House when the manpower authorities in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> declined to extend their stay in Britain in view of Britain’s Common Market obligations and the changed status of Australians in comparison with Common Market nationals? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-101-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> authorities do not keep figures of unsuccussful applications for extension of stay, but state that there are no indications of any increase in numbers of European Economic Community nationals entering the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> for employment since the entry of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> to the European Economic Community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-101-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If not, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Government will be asked to introduce legislation in the terms of the Westminster Bill scheduled to our Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> ministers gave the same advice and, as the Queen announced when opening Parliament on 28 February last year, she decided not to refer the questions to the Privy Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Last year, Queensland again endeavoured to obtain an advisory opinion from the Privy Council- this time in connection with questions concerning  Her  Majesty’s Royal style and titles- the proposal that  Her  Majesty should be known as Queen of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, of Australia, of Queensland and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of that discussion he wrote to the Premiers on 23 July and said that if all the States were to agree that appeals to the Privy Council should be abolished he would be prepared to proceed by means of a joint approach by all the Australian governments to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Government asking it to enact legislation abolishing appeals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister has since had discussions with the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Prime Minister and it has been decided that the best course to resolve these issues is to reintroduce the Bill, and to give every opportunity for questions as to its validity to be raised in the High Court of Australia, in accordance with proper constitutional processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thus Labor has repudiated the North American and Western European roles which its rivals would impose upon it and continues the same role as its sister parties in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, the method of requesting the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> to act is a misuse of the restrictions which are contained in the Statute of Westminster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No Act of Parliament of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> passed after the commencement of this Act shall extend, or be deemed to extend, to a Dominion as part of the law of that Dominion, unless it is expressly declared in that Act that that Dominion has requested, and consented to, the enactment thereof. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time there had been some controversy as to whether that might enable the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia to request the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Parliament to pass laws which might affect matters affecting the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> takes the view that the question whether appeals should be brought to the Privy Council from the courts of a Commonwealth country is essentially a question for the Commonwealth country concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it correct to say that the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> would wish moreover that whatever can be done in and by Australia should be done in and by Australia herself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One way of proceeding is for the Australian Government and Parliament to request and consent to the enactment of <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The view hitherto accepted by all Governments, Commonwealth and State, in Australia has been that if <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> action, whether executive or legislative, is to be taken the request for it should come from the Government which it exclusively or primarily concerns, and from both the Federal and a State Government after joint consultation if it concerns them both. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But even if the external affairs power were exclusive, and there is nothing in the Commonwealth Constitution to make it- so, relations between the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and the States on matters that form pan of the constitutional structure of the States, such as the position of a State Governor or appeals to Her Majesty in Council, are clearly not external affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be to deny history and the very essence of State constitutional institutions to describe constitutional relationships with the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> as an external affair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The right of a State to approach <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> authorities direct on a matter that exclusively or primary concerns the State is well recognised and the absence of any right in the Commonwealth to approach those authorities on such a matter is equally well recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliament requests and consents to the enactment by the Parliament of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> of an Act in, or substantially in, the terms set out in the Schedule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Schedule sets out the Act which this Parliament would request the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Parliament to pass. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In dealing firstly with the question of methodology, as it might be described, let me simply say that this is not the first time this Parliament has requested the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Parliament to act in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Michael  Stewart in 1 966, a Labour Foreign Minister in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, made a speech to the National Press Club in Canberra- his credit would be very high in the Labor Party- and he referred to North Vietnam’s aggression and he said: ‘Make no mistake about it ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1962 Indian and Canadian members of the International Control Commission reported to the joint chairmen of the Geneva Agreement- the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and the U.S.S.R.- that North Vietnam was guilty of acts of aggression and subversion against South Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He goes on to refer to the attention that the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, Canada and even the United States had given in that field following the lead of the Australian States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It gives little indication that some of the major lessons which can be learned from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and from the approaches in Canada, South Africa, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and other countries, have been learned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The absence of evidencegathering powers in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> legislation has been said to impede seriously the effectiveness of the Race Relations Board under that legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750415_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> has been added to the list of countries since that date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has its origin in old <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> legislation which has, so far as concerns recovery of penalties by common informers, been repealed in more recent times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, it is one of those varieties which in recent years has lost some favour in the European and <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In recent years special appropriations have comprised slightly over 50 per cent of total annual expenditure as compared with the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> where the special appropriations of that order do not normally amount to more than 10 per cent of total expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Wright  pointed out, the appropriations have now reached extraordinary dimensions compared with those in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and vast sums of money are appropriated under these specious appropriations which have been presented to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> where the racial tensions have a far greater recognition than in Australia there has been legislation designed to avoid racial discrimination since, I think, 1966. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the commentaries in the news reports, one realises that racial discrimination is as great and as much a source of friction in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> today as it ever was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Far from eliminating racial discrimination by making it illegal, the Bill will highlight the problems between the races and create an official race relations industry with a staff of dedicated anti-racists earning their living by making the most of every complaint in much the same way as does the Race Relations Board in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a practice which has been widely accepted in North America- in both Canada and the United States- in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and in New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The provisions relating to education and research in fact distinguish this legislation from the legislation in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> which has not perhaps been as successful as the Government of that country might have wished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this legislation has any strong relationship with that of other countries, it is clearly with that of the provinces of Canada and not with the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Race Relations Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As if that was not enough, in 1967 a similar inquiry conducted in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> by a House of Commons Select Committee on Nationalised Industries reported as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have the benefit of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and the United States experience and I believe that if we are allowed to enter into the spirit of what is spelt out in the Vernon Commission’s report, hundreds of millions of dollars will accrue to the postal services and will transform it into a viable commercial proposition of which we in Australia will be proud. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have observed that in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> the Post Office Corporation is now responsible for both the postal and telecommunications services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I should like to mention that the results of the establishment of this Corporation in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> show that it sustained a loss of more than 30m in the first 6 months of its life compared with an estimated profit of more than  100m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again may I refer to what has happended in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On a recent trip I looked at the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Postal Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true that the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Corporation has lost money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The evidence that I obtained from looking at commissions overseas indicates that despite those problems in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> corporation, as I have mentioned, all of the managers say that under the new system they are more able to exercise their responsibilities and initiatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Experience of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> corporation shows that that has been greatly successful because it allows the managers to operate the business more successfully. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reason for the shorter quarantine period for animals coming from the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and Ireland is that procedures exist in those countries for rapid identification and notification of any cases of rabies that may occur there, thus permitting Australian quarantine requirements to be modified appropriately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The population of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> is involved in racial discrimination to an infinitely more emphatic degree than the population of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That point can be emphasised somewhat by the fact that at no stage did  Senator Wood  bother to refer to the tribal fighting in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not conceivable to him that Europeans in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> could indulge in tribal fighting as they do in Ulster, and as they have done in Ulster for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Far from eliminating racial discrimination by making it illegal, the Bill will highlight the problems between the races and create an official race relations industry with a staff of dedicated anti-racists earning their living by making the most of every complaint in much the same way as does the Race Relations Board in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is of some interest to look at that Board’s experience, not in any way to say that this Bill should be altered in its approach or that we could do other than perhaps give some thought to the experience in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> in reviewing from time to time how this legislation will operate in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Acting Deputy President,  with respect I agreed with the ruling that you made about  Senator Georges’  point of order but I really think that the issue has now become merely a vehicle for expressing disagreement about trade union activities in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, which is far beyond the scope of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then if we look at the figures relating to the period between June 1974 and June 1975, and unfortunately I do not have any later figures than these, but they are still worth quoting, the rate of inflation in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> increased and it is now running at some 26 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, if the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Senator Willesee)  took some care to read his history, he would recollect that one of the great foreign ministers of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> in the 19th century, Palmerston, made that great speech in the House of Commons in which he quoted the Latin phrase,  civis Britannicus sum.- I  am a British citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have not been able to get any information about the question regarding Adelaide, but I am now told that currently a series of trials are being done by professional men from the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> who have had wide experience in the operation and handling of these birds at aerodromes in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Part II of the Act deals with crewing matters and until recently was in line with similar provisions in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Merchant Shipping Act and both laws applied to a visiting British ship whilst in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Merchant Shipping Act has recently been very substantially changed and it would create technical problems for the master and crew of a ship and the staffs of Mercantile Marine Offices, who administer the relevant provisions of the Act, if the Australian law were to continue to apply to such vessels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although this Convention came into force internationally in 1968, the law in Australia, in relation to the limitation of shipowners’ liability, is still the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Merchant Shipping Acts of 1894 and 1900. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It shows quite clearly that the cost of drugs in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and Canada has stayed about the same, the cost in Australia has fallen dramatically and costs in the United States and Sweden have risen markedly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite the fact that some 2 years ago some Opposition members were party to the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Prices and in particular were party to paragraphs 92 and 93 of the report which pointed out the impossibility of working out these prices and taking into consideration the whole profitability of the drug companies, and despite the fact that the report from the Committee pointed out that there was a regulations scheme in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> which also showed that the whole profitability of the company cannot be used in working out the prices, the Opposition is now in the embarrassing situation, because of pressures from the industry, that it does not want to pass this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us remember that the successful treatment of tuberculosis in Britain saved the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> economy 55m annually at a time when the total drug bill for the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> was f 100m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I might point out to honourable senators that the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> legislation provides for the Law Society’s scheme to operate under ‘the general guidance’ of the Lord Chancellor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since that action was taken, several countries have expressed interest in the service which currently provides for delivery of mail within 48 hours to many places in the United States of America and selected cities in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, and a reciprocal service to Australia is available in the United States of America and the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But when the rates rise again, as they will do on 1 July 1976, the disparity will widen to the point where the cost of shipping Australian canned fruits to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and Europe will be 10 1 per cent higher than the cost of taking fruit from South Africa to the same markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been a feature of political debate in the Western world that goes back, I suppose, to the New Deal of Franklin Roosevelt in the early 1930s and that certainly was given accelerated force by the Labour victory in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> in 1945, that there should be greater participation by government in not only the control but also the production of the resources of the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should have thought that because the incidence of bribery and corruption in foreign ports, particularly in the area of shipping, and in the transportation of goods inside countries, would appear to be fairly high, this announcement would have brought a much larger response, not only in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> but also in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The decision to involve State governments in migration from Britain was made in 1946 by the then Australian Labor Party Government and that decision was to make the State authorities responsible for receiving and assessing personal and group nominations in respect of <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> citizens resident in Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It so happens, and this adds to the disgrace which comes upon this defamer by the name of E. G.

    <p>In 1976, similar supplementary proposals have been made to State Governments by the Commonwealth Government for a support program covering apples exported on an ‘at risk’ basis to <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>/Europe in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commission goes on to say:  we are satisfied that an attempt to divide responsibility for economic policy from that for the formulation of the Budget (and therefore from a major influence on the Forward Estimates processes) would either fail (as it did in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>) or greatly weaken the effectiveness of economic policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although pear exports in 1976 to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and Europe, at 834 000 boxes, were slightly down from the 85 1 000 boxes shipped in 1975, prices obtained were also generally unsatisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Referring to earlier times, prior to 1935 Australia looked predominantly towards the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and virtually regarded herself as a child of the mother country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What we are debating here is a proposal for a maximum price of $2 a box of apples up to 2 million boxes sold at risk in markets in Europe, including the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, and a maximum subsidy in relation to pears of 80 cents a box up to 1.4 million boxes for sale at risk in markets in Europe and the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have before me some figures which show that sales of Western Australian apples to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> in 1975 amounted to 860 000 bushels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1976 they amounted to 720 000 bushels, and it is estimated that in 1977 our exports to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> will show a drop to about 160 000 bushels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conversation with one of the leading exporters in Western Australia, he pointed out to me that there was a problem last year with the standard of packing of some of the Tasmanian apples that were sent to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main reason is that traditionally we have depended on the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>’s entry into the European Economic Community that market is not so readily available to us now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another important reason why we are not getting as much fruit into the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> now, is that in recent years controlled atmosphere storage has been developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>’s local production being available purely seasonally the local produce can be fed onto the market 12 months of the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The market is not now available to the traditional suppliers of apples, in particular, and pears to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Formerly we could send supplies to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> during its off season. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his second reading speech the Minister pointed out that apple exports in 1976 to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and Europe were almost 2.4 million boxes- about one million boxes below the level of exports in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a drop in trade for these commodities of about 30 per cent to the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and Europe alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If apples and pears continue to be produced at the existing crop production rate and if our export market continues to fall- the Minister has already said that the market to Europe and the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> fell by 1 million boxes last year; a fall of 30 per cent- our domestic market will be seriously glutted, resulting probably in further extensive and expensive Government support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to ask why the stabilisation scheme applies only to apples exported to Europe, including the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a substantial fall in the amount of Australian apples and pears landed in Europe and the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As most honourable senators know, the scheme is based on a maximum level of support of $2 a case for some 2 million boxes of apples sold at risk in Europe and in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> markets and of 80 cents a box for 1 400 000 boxes of pears sold at risk on the same market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The consequence was that this year the importing agents in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> simply said: ‘We are broke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today there have developed in the industry, firstly, freight demands that are very critical; secondly, internal production costs have dwarfed the economy of this primary industry in comparison with the economies of other industries of Australia so as to reduce the apple and pear producer to a level of economy that is not respectable from the point of view of parliamentary performance in relation to other strata of our people; thirdly, the industry is beset with unsurpassed marketing difficulties, accentuated by the probable advent of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> into the European economic community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am merely saying that it is rather sad that Sim has to be involved in legal expenses in a High Court action in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> when, if there had been some rapport between the various governments and the people involved, that $lm could have been put to the immediate benefit of the people who claim to have been offended by the actions of the British Phosphate Commission over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> statute, the Foreign Enlistment Act, in force since 1870 and applicable to the British dominions, dealt with enlistment by British subjects in foreign forces but in terms inappropriate in today’s circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Government established a Committee of Privy Counsellors under the chairmanship of Lord Diplock to examine the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee recommended the abolition of the offence of enlisting while abroad as a mercenary and of leaving the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> in order to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Committee, however, recommended new legislation to prohibit recruitment of persons to take up service as mercenaries abroad including prohibition of offers of employment as a mercenary, publishing information as to how or where to apply for such employment or to reach the place where it is available, or making any payment or taking part in any arrangement to enable or assist a person to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Independently of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> inquiry, the Australian Government had conducted its own examination which produced the same broad conclusion as the Diplock Committee, namely, that it was not appropriate to attempt to prohibit enlistment outside Australia or to regulate overseas military activities of Australiansexcept incursion activities dealt with under clause 6- but it was desirable to control recruitment within Australia of mercenaries for service in foreign forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this were a sufficient ground for preventing <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> citizens from going abroad, anyone who was poor could be debarred from travelling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To prevent an individual from carrying on any particular activity involves some restriction on his freedom particularly if it affects his livelihood, but the curtailment of freedom involved in the prohibition of what can at most be an intermittent activity of recruiting mercenaries in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> is a minor one and does not require a high degree of danger to the public interest in order to justify it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand although, as will later appear, we do not think there are any means by which it would be practicable to prevent a <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> citizen from volunteering while he is abroad to serve as a mercenary and from leaving the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> to do so, we should regard any attempt to impose such a prohibition upon him by law as involving a deprivation of his freedom to do as he will which would require to be justified by a much more compelling reason of public policy than the prohibition of active recruiting of mercenaries within the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Like other honourable senators I was attracted to the committee set up in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> following the Angolan exercise when, I think, 160 citizens of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> enrolled as mercenaries following advertisements in Great Britain and took up the cause, I believe, of the FNLA- the National Front for the Liberation of Angola against the MPLA- the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola in the Angolan conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To prevent a <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> citizen from accepting service as a mercenary abroad is a restriction upon his personal freedom which could only be justified on grounds of public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under any new legislation enlistment as a mercenary by a <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> citizen should cease to be a criminal offence and service as a mercenary abroad should not be made one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any new legislation should be directed to empowering Her Majesty’s Government to prohibit recruitment in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> of mercenaries for service in specified armed forces abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Incidentally, this recommendation was criticised strongly by many <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> newspapers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course those migrants, particularly those 1 1,290 people who reside in that electorate and who  Senator Hall  said were born in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and Ireland, will not believe that  Senator Hall  has any interest in their welfare until such time as he comes out in public and denies his support for the statements  Mr Sinclair  has made everywhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For some reason he has incurred the wrath of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Uren,  in the other place who expected a very distinguished member of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Labour Government to look after his political fortunes rather than the interests of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I understand it, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Minister said that he was satisfied with the precautions which have been taken in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only has  Dr Mabon  enunciated the views of  Mr Callaghan  ‘s <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Labour Government; it would also be the policy of the British Trade Union Congress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator would know that some weeks ago I read into  Hansard  a resolution of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Trade Union Congress on 8 September this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Trade Union Congress is devoting its time and attention to the benefits its members will receive from such a program and not indulging in politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It certainly is not uncommon in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, with its first past the post system, for a party to get 60 per cent of the seats with 30 per cent or 40 per cent of the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 was also very interested last week to have discussions with  Dr Mabon,  the British Minister of State for Energy, in the Labour Government of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, who came to Australia for the prime purpose of having discussions and endeavouring to get a guarantee that England will have available continuing supplies of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is backed by the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> union congress itself, the members of which I understand are 10 to one in favour of importing uranium and recently urged their Government to expand its nuclear program in order to avoid an energy crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can see the great need in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> for uranium when one realises that the Labour Party Government in office in that country has sent its senior Minister in the energy field to us to plead not only for a sufficient supply, but also for the support of its counterpart, the Australian Labor <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has turned from the view which is held by the trade union movement in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, the view which is held by the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Government, the view which is held by this Government and the view which it held two years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Independently of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> inquiry, the Australian Government had conducted its own examination which produced the same broad conclusion as the Diplock Committee, namely, that it was not appropriate to attempt to prohibit enlistment outside Australia or to regulate overseas military activities of Australians- except incursion activities dealt with under clause 6- but it was desirable to control recruitment within Australia of mercenaries for service in foreign forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the last few weeks, in my role as Minister for Special Trade Negotiations, I have visited the Commission of the EEC and several member states- Denmark, Italy, the Federal Republic of Germany and the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, the timing of the election making it preferable to visit France later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Records of the Authority in relation to the 99 deceased contractors’ employees are incomplete but indicate that workers from at least the following countries were included in the fatalities: Austria, Australia, Belgium, Estonia, Germany, Holland, Ireland, Italy, Philippines, Poland, Romania, Spain, <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, United States of America, Yugoslavia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It refers to changes which have been made in the manner of payment of British pensions to <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> pensioners now living in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of background I indicate that British pensioners who reside in Australia are believed to be suffering difficulties, as the honourable senator mentioned, because of the direct payment of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> pensions from the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> Department of Health and Social Security in sterling orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those changed arrangements were the result of initiatives taken by the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> authorities and were not sought by my Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that about 77 per cent of <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> pensioners residing in Australia also receive an Australian pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My Department has no plans to try to overcome the cost which is involved in the direct payment from the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second matter I wish to raise is that the number of people receiving portable invalid pensions in Greece seems, on the face of it and if one compares the figures, to be disproportionate to the numbers in other large migrant groups such as Italians, Yugoslavians, or people from the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since the announcement of Australia ‘s decision to proceed with further uranium development, a number of countries, including the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, the Philippines, the United States, West Germany, France, Finland, and Japan, have registered their desire to secure uranium from Australia for their nuclear power programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As those honourable senators who have interested themselves in the history of Australia will know, the early ships sailing around the Australian coast were basically ships on their way to or from the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some reference was made by  Senator Wriedt  to the fact that this will be a relatively small College, but in comparison with the Leith College in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> it will have more students than that College, which is one of the better colleges in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and one which has been moving towards this total training concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been developments in a number of the other colleges in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> to move, as I indicated earlier, further towards that total training concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the points in my reading in relation to training maritime industry personnel that I found quite interesting was that apparently in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> one of the first female graduates is acting as a third officer on a ship carrying ore.

    <p>It has been criticised by under-developed countries for the term and conditions on which assistance is provided and, even in the case of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and Italy, it was a widely held view that the conditions imposed for the granting of short-term financial accommodation unduly restricted the freedom of both governments to introduce measures to cope with internal problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The way in which Qantas ‘s advertising is conducted in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> is not a humorous matter; it is a matter of a public company denigrating the Australian national airline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that that situation is intolerable to any Australian, but particularly to those of us who believe that our national status demands that Australian citizens be subject only to legal rules devised by Australian courts or by Australian parliaments and not by bodies in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Quite clearly the printing was far too small in terms of numbers and far too many of them were immediately despatched to major philatelic outlets in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and the United States so that in Australia, bearing in mind the relationship between the Australian Postal Commission and the philatelic services of Christmas Island, there were very few, if any, of these sets available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In order to assist the judiciary in the administration of court systems and to provide information and advice which would enable the judges to keep the rules of their court practical, simple and up-to-date, the Committee recommends that the Government give consideration to establishing an institute of judicial administration along the lines of those already operating in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Bearing in mind the practice in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and the provisions of our own Public Accounts Committee Act, I think a procedure along these lines might well prove to be a useful beginning: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am suggesting also that we must get away from our chauvinistic attitude that only medical graduates of Australia, the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and some odd universities in the world are considered satisfactory medical practitioners in this country and others are excluded because they come from such undistinguished medical schools as Vienna and other leading medical schools in Italy, the United States and all over the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is not unaware of the effectiveness of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> National Research and Development Corporation because only this month it received a report from a most outstanding Australian academic, Professor Ron Johnston, of the Department of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Wollongong, making absolutely clear to the Government the extent to which co-operation between the Government and the private sector can be a major factor in reversing this lamentable trend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have already mentioned, the fact that this is growing in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and that there are consequent failures on the part of the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> economy to adapt ought to be salutory lessons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Labor preferences for a ‘scientist dominated Council’ reflected a naive ‘leave it to the expert’ syndrome and an ignorance of the tendency for such councils elsewhereparticularly in the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span> and Canada- to undermine the scientific sophistication and awareness of potential users, to concentrate on supply rather than demand problems, and to obfuscate the termination of priorities and value choices that necessarily must be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other parts of his question were a little complicated in that they asked whether I was aware of certain percentages of expenditure by certain countries and, in particular, whether I was aware that research expenditure is declining in the United States and the <span class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, compared with that of some other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
