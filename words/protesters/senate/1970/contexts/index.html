<ul>
  <li>
    <p>They are akin to the professional <span class="highlight">protesters</span>, the people who seek publicity for its own sake and who want to be recorded in the newspapers and on television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>called on the AttorneyGeneral,  Mr Hughes,  to ‘make up his mind’ about the prosecution of <span class="highlight">protesters</span> who invaded national service offices and other buildings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could it be that Australian <span class="highlight">protesters</span> who are now so vocal protest only when a country of which they disapporive is involved and that their indignation is selective? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, any nation that receives the official representatives of other nations should see to it that they are protected against harass- ment or intimidation by organised groups of <span class="highlight">protesters</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not saying that the position is exactly analagous, but recently we had in Melbourne people who I would in fact describe as hoodlums but who describe themselves as <span class="highlight">protesters</span>, who attempted to set fire to wastepaper baskets in the General Post Office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said last night-4 will not walk away from anything I have said - I do not think that anybody has a right to be a nuisance or to deface property, but the reason why there are <span class="highlight">protesters</span> today is the legislation that the Government is a party to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, protest of this nature or magnitude is relatively new and the measures taken against the <span class="highlight">protesters</span> are relatively new. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose the most noticeable are the anti-war <span class="highlight">protesters</span>, who, basically, are against war because they understand the stupidity and the futility of war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The anti-war <span class="highlight">protesters</span> and the anti-conscription <span class="highlight">protesters</span> are those groups of youths which have woken up to many of the things about which I have spoken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">protesters</span> include quite  a  substantial proportion of university graduates, university students and other young people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They feel that being against an anti-war movement or against the <span class="highlight">protesters</span> satisfies their need for something to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to my own observations of protests these <span class="highlight">protesters</span> generally do not do anything personal against the representatives; it is against their country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would anyone say that the <span class="highlight">protesters</span> at the Eureka Stockade injured Australia by acting in defiance of the law? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is evident not only in this case but also in the manner in which the Commonwealth Police carried out certain raids against University students in southern universities and in the treatment of <span class="highlight">protesters</span> against apartheid in South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-96">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Aboriginal embassy is erected again, or if there is any similar protest on the lawns in front of Parliament House, any politician who goes across the road to support the <span class="highlight">protesters</span> - and politicians have thought that it is their duty to do so - will be in breach of this Ordinance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 wonder how many <span class="highlight">protesters</span> would have been marching up and down the streets of their capital cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second matter that arises from this question- I take this opportunity to make this perfectly clear to honourable senators- is that there has been in existence since 1937 an Ordinance of the ACT forbidding groups of more than 20 <span class="highlight">protesters</span> to assemble inside an area 100 yards from the physical walls of Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that to some extent that is the reason the <span class="highlight">protesters</span> are perhaps not as vocal about this matter as one might normally have expected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the <span class="highlight">protesters</span> left the area shortly after the incident, the Department of Transport is obtaining material from the police which it will examine, in conjunction with the Attorney-General’s Department, to see whether there has been a breach of any Commonwealth requirement such as the collision regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770913_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not even recall the  West Australian  running anything about this group of <span class="highlight">protesters</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be wise for us to frown upon such a conference, and we should not allow ourselves to be placed in a position where young radical <span class="highlight">protesters</span> have to take a stand on our behalf in the defence of freedom of expression and communication. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a time when  Mr Dunstan  is presenting himself as the champion of anti-uranium <span class="highlight">protesters</span> and the champion of Aboriginal interests, the revelation that uranium drilling is taking place in Aboriginal historic and sacred areas must dismay Aboriginals throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we all know, the Premier of Queensland has continued to use battalions of police to control- ‘harass’ may be a more apt word- <span class="highlight">protesters</span> who believe that they have the right to march when voicing their protest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently he admitted that his use of the police to confront <span class="highlight">protesters</span> had probably cost about $lm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They took all sorts of photographs of those who participated in the rally and they objected strongly when certain <span class="highlight">protesters</span> that day began to take photographs of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Were they observing or overseeing the New South Wales Police Force which was moved in to remove <span class="highlight">protesters</span> from the logging operations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
