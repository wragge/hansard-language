<ul>
  <li>
    <p>That the House notes that 90 prominent American Vietnam war <span class="highlight">protesters</span>, including folksinger Joan Baez, poet Allan Ginsberg and imprisoned draft resister James Forrest have signed a petition presented to the permanent Vietnamese observer to the United Nations condemning the Vietnamese Government for grave abuses of civil liberties, suppression of free speech, grievous and systematic violation of human rights, filling of prisons with civilians accused only of holding certain religious and ideological beliefs, detention of an estimated 300 000 people in so-called re-education camps, suppression of cultural and polictical expression, and stifling of non-violent dissent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The headline reads: ‘250,000 War <span class="highlight">Protesters</span> Stage Peaceful Rally in Washington; Militants Stir Clashes Later’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that some of the <span class="highlight">protesters</span> and some of the people who deliberately or unwittingly give help to our enemy might consider that they are costing the lives of soldiers in this Vietnam struggle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can see no connection whatever between photographs being taken at protest rallies whether they are taken by police or whether they are taken at the invitation of the <span class="highlight">protesters</span> as, for example, when they asked photographers to come along and photograph them when they made a violent attack on the house of the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700821_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor in power means the end of power for the people and power for the <span class="highlight">protesters</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appeared in the ‘Catholic Worker’ and stated that any donations should be sent to the Conscientious Objectors Non-Pacifist Advisory Committee, which is an organisation known to have assisted other <span class="highlight">protesters</span> with financial aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are not against <span class="highlight">protesters</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, any nation that receives the official representatives of other nations should see to it that they are protected against harassment or intimidation by organised groups of <span class="highlight">protesters</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One prominent sports writer accused some politicians of ‘hopping on the bandwagon’ and others have suggested that it was ‘this year’s issue’ for <span class="highlight">protesters</span> who didn’t really know very much about apartheid anyhow’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These same peaceful <span class="highlight">protesters</span> may have saved us from being cast out of the Olympic family; I believe we are after all to be invited to participate in the next Olympic Games. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the residents pointed out to the <span class="highlight">protesters</span> that it was ironical and incongruous that potentially good houses should be pulled down against the wishes of the owners to make way for flats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr E.  C. McCartney of the Petersville Dairying Division was one of the <span class="highlight">protesters</span> about this control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The young <span class="highlight">protesters</span> ought to go down on their knees and thank God for what America did for Australia during World War II instead of behaving in the thoughtless and thankless way in which they do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Canberra, where there are so many demonstrations, they have to deal, not only with decent <span class="highlight">protesters</span>, but with male and female hooligans who join in whenever and wherever there is the slightest hint of revolt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">protesters</span> will be here on Thursday, which is again 4 months after the Fraser Government was elected to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Where are those <span class="highlight">protesters</span> today in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why do they not join the American anti-war <span class="highlight">protesters</span> in their condemnation of the present regime in South Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where are the Austraiian <span class="highlight">protesters</span> today to follow the honest, open and admirable attitudes of their American counterparts? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The war was mounted by the North as part of the general communist requirement for expansion in that area, and the American anti-war <span class="highlight">protesters</span> obviously were duped and now have come bitterly to realise what occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where are the anti-war <span class="highlight">protesters</span> from the Opposition today, now that there are thousands and thousands of dead bodies in the soil of Cambodia and in its rivers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">protesters</span> seem to forget that the production of uranium is four years away and there is time for that technology to be developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have noted that, amongst other things, one union leader has said: ‘Violent uranium <span class="highlight">protesters</span>, mad lunatic elements, want bloodshed, want confrontation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he also have the co-manager reinstated, as the marching <span class="highlight">protesters</span> demanded? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister also investigate the request of the <span class="highlight">protesters</span> and lend his weight to their demands that the men likely to make such decisions - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of Albany made their feelings very clear when expensively equipped <span class="highlight">protesters</span> from interstate and from overseas tried to disrupt the whaling operations last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the full glare of the television camera the newspaper reporter said: ‘That policeman has his knee on the face of one of these <span class="highlight">protesters</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
