<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Also, the Minister says that the provisions of the Convention regarding the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and duties of an aircraft commander are wider than those in the Crimes (Aircraft) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has said that it does not have adequate <span class="highlight">powers</span> to deal with a situation such as that existing at present in waters adjacent to our shores. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not hear the Minister say in his summing up whether the <span class="highlight">powers</span> entrusted to the Minister include power to stipulate the type of detergent to be used in the dispersal of oil spillages? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why cannot the Department of Health be given full <span class="highlight">powers</span> by making proposed new section 9b read: “The Minister may provide, or arrange for the provision of vaccine for the purpose of immunising persons’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill provides for the establishment of such an Institute, to be known as the Australian Institute of Marine Science, and makes formal provision for the detailed planning of its functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will note that the Bill provides for the appointment of an Interim Council to make recommendations on the functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Institute and it is the intention of the Minister for Education and Science  (Mr N. H. Bowen)  to appoint  Dr M.  F. Day of CSIRO as  Chairman  and the following scientists as members of the Interim Council: Professor C. Burdon-Jones of the University College of Townsville;  Dr N.  H. Fisher of the Commonwealth Bureau of Mineral Resources: Professor Dorothy Hill, Department of Geology and Mineralogy, University of Queensland;  Mr Walter  Ives, Secretary of the Department of Primary Industry:  Dr D.  F. McMichael, Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service in the State of New South Wales; and Professor R. J. Walsh, representing the Australian Academy of Science. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As soon as the Interim Council has completed its work, the Minister for education and Science will place its recommendations before the Government so that a further Bill may be introduced prescribing in detail the functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Institute and its constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> as they appear in clause 7 (1.) <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, they are very much proscribed by the <span class="highlight">powers</span> following in clause 7 (2. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>), that is to say, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> to borrow moneys and to lend moneys. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any event, the Corporation has only <span class="highlight">powers</span> to do things in the performance of its functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without limiting the generality of the last preceding sub-section but subject to the succeeding provisions of this section, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Corporation referred to in that sub-section include power . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Corporation are then set out in paragraphs (a) to (k) in which specific matters are mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the presence of three members of the committee shall be necessary to constitute a meeting of the committee for the exercise of its <span class="highlight">powers</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister to direct an Australian flag ship to be repaired and maintained by Australian repair facilities I am not able to say, but .1 shall certainly find out for die honourable senator because I understand this is a matter of concern in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(g) he will see that one of the functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission is as follows:  to make arrangements for the sale, otherwise than at auction, of wool received by a broker for sale at auction that the Commission considers cannot advantageously be offered for sale at auction and for the processing of any such wool before sale; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that many of the matters that are mentioned in partIII, with which I shall deal later, are beyond the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission, because the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission are set out in another clause further on in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission shall not perform its functions or exercise its <span class="highlight">powers</span> except for the purpose of achieving the object specified in the last preceding sub-section or for another purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I give credit to the present Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Wentworth)  who does not happen to be of the same political persuasion as myself but who is recognised to be doing a very worthwhile job within the limits of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that he has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonweatlh has surrendered none of ils <span class="highlight">powers</span> and none of ils control over land in the ACT. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>is to give to the Auditor-General the same <span class="highlight">powers</span> as he has in respect of any of his normal Public Service audits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister representing the Attorney-General examine the legal <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Government in regard to company law to see what protection small stockholders have from runaway boards of directors like that of Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers (Aust.) <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Committee in Darwin comprising the harbourmaster and oil company representatives (vide Northern Territory Newsletter, December 1970, pages 3-4), what <span class="highlight">powers</span> will the harbourmaster have to ensure that the individual views of an offending oil company will not necessarily decide which dispersed or detergent is used to combat a spillage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assure the honourable senator that the Commonwealth will consult the States with regard to any future legislation resulting from an exercise of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the High Court has declared the Commonwealth has and may exercise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Prior to the introduction of any future legislation which might be contemplated at any time, based on the apparently substantially increased <span class="highlight">powers</span> now available to the Commonwealth, will the Government give earnest consideration to full consultation with the States so that the States can be fully informed and their advice sought in these matters and so that the full spirit of co-operative federalism will be implemented? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Attorney-General aware of a judgment given yesterday in the Northern Territory by  Mr Justice  Forster relating to the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> of parliamentary committees? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Has he now had an opportunity to read the judgment that was given by  Mr Justice  Forster in the Northern Territory Supreme Court last Monday relating to an interpretation of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Northern Territory Legislative Council? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I recall, the answer which I gave to the Senate on Tuesday was that, on the information then available to me, the nature of the judgment distinguished between the inquisitorial <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are traditional to the Houses of Parliament of Westminster and the investigatory <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are in aid of legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> under clause 5 - they are very slender indeed - would be exercised only to ensure that relatively small amounts of money would not lie idle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May the Senate be assured that the Government is actively considering the use of ali the legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> at the disposition of the Commonwealth to ensure that the restraint which is being called for in wage and salary increases will be applied to those in receipt of high incomes as well as the wage earners at the bottom of the scale? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to rake over the old question as to whether our Party should be involved on the Joint Committee but we have in the Senate an all-party committee on foreign affairs and defence which has wider <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth are under examination in that respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the Minister for Immigration be prepared to use his discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span> to assist the affected members to obtain job security by granting them permanency? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: Was there an agreement in principle at the April meeting of Commonwealth and State Ministers to ‘provide uniform <span class="highlight">powers</span> to combat this sort of problem’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>title add ‘and under certain other laws in relation to which the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Parliament extend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the report released yesterday by the Australian Wool Industry Conference seeking full <span class="highlight">powers</span> of wool clip acquisition makes no reference to the possible cost of the scheme to the taxpayers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It needs no unusual <span class="highlight">powers</span> of perception, or knowledge of economics (a grasp of simple arithmetic will suffice) to see that this is the main immediate cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Commonwealth any <span class="highlight">powers</span> in this matter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should I take it from his earlier reply to my question about replays of football programmes on Sunday mornings that, while the Government delays in introducing legislation to clarify the existing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, the Board is quite powerless to act against any programme shown by commercial licensees in that time period and that therefore commercial licensees are completely free to show any programme at all between the hours of 6 a.m. and 12 noon on Sundays? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a lot of conflict inside the Government coalition as to the date when independence shall begin, as to when self government shall begin and as to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that ministers shall have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that anyone will argue with the contention that ministers have had considerably limited <span class="highlight">powers</span> over a long period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Education in Australia traditionally has been regarded as primarily a responsibility of State governments, but it is true also that ample <span class="highlight">powers</span> exist under the Constitution for the Commonwealth to make financial contributions in a number of fields, including education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under which <span class="highlight">powers</span> and for what reasons has the Attorney-General’s Department declined to proclaim and recognise the Autocephalic Greek Orthodox Church in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the person charged signed a statement confessing that he had bombed the Communist Party headquarters in Brisbane, he was set free by the legal <span class="highlight">powers</span> in that land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth are very limited in this regard and there is nothing we can do if the facts are as stated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is the Government aware of its clear legal <span class="highlight">powers</span> to act in the national interest when there is a ban or boycott on overseas trade or the conveyance of passengers overseas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I ask the Minister for Primary Industry  (Senator Wriedt)  who is now in charge of it whether he can ascertain from the departmental officers whether there are other provisions which will enable these <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be exercised if there is an order for deportation made under the Migration Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier I said there would be no reduction in the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Legislative Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Hannan has discovered so belated in his term in this House, let him get up at some stage and go through the whole ambit of what is happening in the world in relation to the great <span class="highlight">powers</span>- and not isolated to one great power only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could the Leader of the Government in the Senate please reconcile for the benefit of honourable senators the following conflicting statements: Firstly, the assurance of the Leader of the Government in the Senate that the decision to site Sydney’s second airport at Galston was not final and the Prime Minister’s statement at the Baulkham Hills Shire Council chambers last Friday that you are getting Galston’; secondly, the Prime Minister’s statement on 9 September that all interest rates would rise and the Prime Minister’s subsequent statement a few days later that home interest loans would be exempted from higher rates; and thirdly the Prime Minister’s statement to the House of Representatives yesterday that he had been promised trade union co-operation in restraining wages and incomes if the Government obtained <span class="highlight">powers</span> to control prices, and  Mr Hawke  ‘s denial of the promise this morning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reactionary capitalist forces of the world had built up Hitler and he in turn was able to suborn others of his ilk like Mussolini and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> in Japan in order to form a triumvirate or a troika, or whatever one likes to call the trio that challenged the rights of man to live in freedom on this earth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would have thought this was a useful amendment in clarifying the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and in making it clear that the intention was not to exercise <span class="highlight">powers</span> like this which would not be in the real interests of conservation but which would rather lead to a competition between 2 governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be helpful if legislation of this nature were perhaps to begin with the words ‘pursuant to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred by section’- then would appear the relevant section ‘of the Constitution’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I assume that the Minister is saying that he will support in every way the recommendation that the Minister use his regulatory <span class="highlight">powers</span> to ensure that the health funds do not abuse the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Government, in the exercise of <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred by the Financial Corporations Act, intend to move on a national level to prevent such abuses of the laws relating to consumer credit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would seem to me that the Defence Service Homes Act, the parent Act, confers certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> on the Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill does not seem to contain any mention of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We assume that the Corporation has only whatever <span class="highlight">powers</span> are conferred by the Defence Service Homes Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Act outlines the <span class="highlight">powers</span>, functions and policies of the defence service homes scheme which in future will be conducted by the Defence Service Homes Corporation created by clause 8 of the Bill that we are now considering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In consequence of the Government’s decision to implement in substance the recommendations contained in the interim report of the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs and to give the Australian Federal Police all necessary <span class="highlight">powers</span> for narcotics inquiries, certain consequential amendments need to be made to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As much as I am reluctant not to limit the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Queensland Government- this is an opportunity so to do- we would very much support the principle enunciated by  Senator Chaney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-102-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A copy is attached to the Bill, but its main provisions may be summarised as follows: (I) it requires contracting states to provide for their criminal law to apply aboard their aircraft - for example a flag law - on international flights and it specifies when contracting states may exercise jurisdiction over offences committed on board aircraft; (II) it defines the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and responsibilities of the aircraft commander who finds that a person has committed, or is about to commit, a serious offence against the flag law of the aircraft, or an act on board likely to endanger the safety of other persons on the aircraft; (III) it also defines the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and duties of contracting states in relation to offenders on board aircraft - including taking them into custody, making preliminary enquiries, deportation etc; and (IV) contracting states are required in cases of illegal seizure of aircraft to  take  all appropriate steps to restore control of the aircraft by its lawful commander. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer particularly to the Crimes (Aircraft) Act 1963, which contains a number of provisions which have already given effect to some of the requirements of the Tokyo Convention, especially those relating to flag law for Australian aircraft and the aircraft commander’s <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of the Convention regarding <span class="highlight">powers</span> and duties of the aircraft commander are wider than those in the Act, and these would become effective as between the parties to the Convention for foreign aircraft in Australia and for Australian aircraft operating overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The duties and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of Commonwealth authorities in relation to offenders disembarked from foreign aircraft would also be expanded to those specified in the Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Other provisions of the Bill deal with incidental matters, including the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of magistrates in relation to the remanding of offenders and their release from custody, evidence, application of stare laws and territory laws in respect of persons in custody, arrangements with the States for the services of magistrates, the making of regulations to give effect to the Act, and the publication of notices as to the contracting states which have ratified or denounced the Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave - In harmony with the Government’s approach indicated in the Governor-General’s Speech the Government intends to introduce some immediate changes within the provisions of the present Papua and New Guinea Act which will give Ministerial Members drawn from the Papua and New Guinea House of Assembly increased <span class="highlight">powers</span> both individually in relation to the functions of their departments and collectively as members of the Administrator’s Executive Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not to be measured in terms of specific <span class="highlight">powers</span>, individual acts of administration or areas of policy or increased financial delegations but it will be apparent by the degree to which the Administrator’s Executive Council in future influences the Government’s attitude on important issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The provisions of the Convention regarding the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and duties of an aircraft commander are wider than the provisions of the Crimes (Aircraft) Act, which applies to flights within Australia and overseas flights emanating from or terminating in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The duties and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of Commonwealth authorities are also outlined in the Minister’s second reading speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The important thing is that some of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the Tokyo Convention are far wider than the <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the present Commonwealth legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real significance of the Bill is that the wider <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the Tokyo Convention will become effective as between the parties ratifying the Convention for foreign aircraft in Australia and Australian aircraft operating overseas, which is of particular importance to Qantas Airways Ltd. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is the question of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and responsibilities of an aircraft commander, which are very clearly defined and are far wider than the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and responsibilities of an aircraft commander under the Australian legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> and duties of contracting states in relation to offenders on board aircraft are also defined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I read the Bill and in accordance with the Minister’s second reading speech, we have to realise that we abandon to some extent authorities and <span class="highlight">powers</span> that we have already under the Act described as the Crimes (Aircraft) Act 1963. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take it that it means that, if a person was on an aircraft and was attempting to flee a country for political considerations and that was a breach of the penal law but not of the penal law that provided for the safety of aircraft, it would not be within the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the commander to operate the <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred under this Convention and to handle such a person merely to obtain compliance with or submission to the penal law not being the penal law affecting the safety of the aircraft or the vulnerability of the security of the passengers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The provisions of the Convention regarding <span class="highlight">powers</span> and duties of the aircraft commander are wider than those in the Act . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it defines the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and responsibilities of an aircraft commander. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, it defines the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and duties of contracting states. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of defining the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of an aircraft commander and making quite sure that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> are adequate becomes of increasing importance with the increase in size of aircraft and the increase in number of passengers that aircraft are carrying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One related to South Australia and the other related to the comment in the second reading speech that the provisions of the Convention regarding <span class="highlight">powers</span> and duties of the aircraft commander are wider than those in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In answer to the honourable senator’s comment on the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the aircraft commander, the passing of the Bill will give the pilot in command of the aircraft the benefit of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred by the Convention in cases to which it applies and will give protection against actions for damages given by Articles 10 and 25 of the schedule to the Crimes (Aircraft) Act, which articles give commanders adequate <span class="highlight">powers</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the Senate, al its rising, adjourn till tomorrow at 10 a.m.  1 do not suppose that any honourable senator has a great deal of pleasure in having to move the adjournment of the Senate for the purpose of discussing a matter of urgency, but I believe that, because of the neglect of Aboriginals in many fields, the apparent inability of the Government to implement <span class="highlight">powers</span> granted by the people in the Aboriginal Affairs Referendum of 1967 in the spirit in which the referendum proposal was supported by the people of Australia and many other reasons, it is necessary that such a matter of extreme urgency be debated now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth gained certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> as a result of the carry in &lt;&gt; of the referendum proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Either it does not have a great deal of power or, if it has <span class="highlight">powers</span>, its <span class="highlight">powers</span> are apparently not being exercised by the Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Wentworth). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators should remember that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> obtained constitutionally by the Commonwealth Government as a result of the 1967 referendum are additional to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> inherent in a State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government was aware that incidents such as the ‘Oceanic Grandeur’ spillage might occur from the experiences of other countries and it ought to have taken steps long before this to anticipate such an incident and provide itself with the necessary <span class="highlight">powers</span> to cope with the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister in the case of non-compliance with the notice are set out in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>J should like the Minister to give a further explanation of proposed section 329f in relation to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister for Shipping and Transport in taking ‘such action in relation to the ship or ils cargo, or the ship and its cargo, as is specified in the notice’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that when the Senate has given the Bill a speedy passage the Minister for Shipping and Transport will be able to exercise his <span class="highlight">powers</span> so as to prevent the pollution of the coast; but at the same time there are some questions relating to the Bill and the Minister’s second reading speech on which I would like further information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In far too many fields the Australian Government wants to know what Britain and the United States of America, or some other major maritime <span class="highlight">powers</span>, are doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are prepared to give to the Government for 6 months the <span class="highlight">powers</span> set out in this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I want to make is that it is necessary to give <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Minister so that he can act very effectively and quickly, if necessary, because this ship is not sitting in an area of safety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister did not have the <span class="highlight">powers</span> to do these things before, hence the legislation was passed in the other place today and it is here for us to pass tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tonight this legislation is giving protection to our coastal areas as far as we are capable and able to go in giving protection because within this Bill the Minister has <span class="highlight">powers</span> to do these things which some honourable senators have suggested this Bill does not empower him to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one goes on further one sees the further <span class="highlight">powers</span> the Minister has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The effectiveness conies in with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the Minister has to do the things in his capacity as Minister to give the utmost protection in the event of a leak or the possibility of a leak. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On this occasion 1 have made the point that this Bill gives the Minister full <span class="highlight">powers</span> to act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also point out to  Senator Cavanagh  that some control over foreign tankers outside as well as inside territorial waters was originally envisaged, but the Convention on the High Seas and general international law prevent any wider application of our <span class="highlight">powers</span> than as now drafted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>True, he would be liable to a penalty of $2,000 only, but the Minister would still have residual <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The agenda, as one would expect, was a comprehensive one and covered such questions as the role and responsibilities of medium and small <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the maintenance of international peace, social progress as a factor and condition of economic development, prospects for agreement on the control of armaments, the role of parliament in the protection of the human environment and the conservation of nataral resources for future generations, relations between parliament and local authorities and cultural exchanges as a means of increasing understanding between countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the duty of the Parliament to keep a check on the subordinate legislation which is made pursuant to <span class="highlight">powers</span> granted to outside bodies by Acts of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is true that the Parliament may delegate its legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> to other persons - official or even private - and it frequently does so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is important that this chamber as well as the other chamber should keep a check on the exercise of these <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are provided in this regard be exercised and that they be exercised in a salutary fashion so that whoever is responsible for framing the regulations will ensure that they keep within the limits provided by the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bills we are considering contain provisions that make it very clear to me that the Director-General of Social Services will delegate his <span class="highlight">powers</span> to officers in charge of branch offices throughout the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That a Select Committee be appointed to inquire into and report upon the desirability and feasibility of establishing a securities and exchange commission by the Commonwealth either alone or in co-operation with the States and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions necessary for such a commission to enable it to act speedily and efficiently against manipulation of prices, insider trading and such other improper or injurious practices as the Committee finds have occurred or may occur in relation to shares and other securities of public companies, and to recommend generally in regard to the foregoing such legislative and administrative measures by the Commonwealth as will, having regard to the constitutional division of legislative power in Australia, enable the utmost protection of members of the public and the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must assume that the stock exchanges used all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> at their disposal, all their facilities and resources, in connection with this affair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of a supervisory body there should be 1 body and not 6 or 7. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should have wide discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span> which can be used to prevent improper practices as well as to ensure that they are punished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal here is for the committee to investigate and report upon whether such a commission is feasible and whether it is desirable and, if so, what <span class="highlight">powers</span> it should have to act speedily and efficiently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The committee will consider the constitutional and legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> in point here are primarily those over foreign corporations and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth; and trade and commerce with other countries and among the States, as well as other <span class="highlight">powers</span> over banking, insurance, taxation and incidental matters, lt will consider also ways in which Commonwealth and State co-operation can be achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As 1 have said, the Commission had wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> of investigation for the purpose of determining whether any breach of the Securities Act had been or was about to be committed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>to provide for the constitution of a Corporate Affairs Commission and to define its <span class="highlight">powers</span>, authorities, duties and functions; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as far as the lawyers are concerned it has always been regarded as a matter of uncertainty as to how far those <span class="highlight">powers</span> extend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If a securities and exchange commission is to be appointed it must depend upon either of those two <span class="highlight">powers</span>, or maybe a combination of both of them, to which I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not doubt that the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth and the Attorneys-General of the States will take heed of a considered report of this committee on what might be the legal <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 certainly am not a person who would seek to take away from the States <span class="highlight">powers</span> which legitimately and properly are theirs, but I do feel that if there is a problem which is Australia-wide in its complexities and which has no significant differences which might arise from State to State, that constitutes a situation in which the Commonwealth should be prepared to exercise on a Commonwealth basis such <span class="highlight">powers</span> as it has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new Securities Industry Bill, which I imagine has been introduced not only in Victoria but also in most of the other States, will deal with the manipulation of shares on the market, the spreading of false rumours, the creating of a false impression of the market, the setting up of compensation funds to take care of clients in certain circumstances, the establishment of trust accounts and their maintenance in those States in which trust accounts presently exist, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the legislature to disallow new rules that the stock exchanges may introduce and the licensing of share dealers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second set of <span class="highlight">powers</span> intrusted to the Commissioner are those which will enable him to build in anticipation of the receipt of applications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It authorises accession by Australia to the Tokyo Convention and confers <span class="highlight">powers</span> for giving effect to the provisions of the Bill in Australia - for example, for restoration of a hijacked aircraft to its commander, for the holding of a preliminary inquiry for the purposes of the Convention and for taking into custody persons who are delivered by the aircraft commander. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When an issue is announced everyone should be given a chance to apply, even if the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that be may have already decided who is going to get the issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, the Senate in Washington moves into the area of presidential <span class="highlight">powers</span> by the constitutional propriety which it has to observe with its power over the appointments of ambassadors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I do not want to embark on an enlargement of the United States congressional <span class="highlight">powers</span> in this context. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Successive governments of that time refused to enlarge the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Commonwealth Parliament, as a result of which Australia suffered because for many years there was no Opposition representation on the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In harmony with the Government’s approach indicated in the Governor-General’s Speech the Government intends to introduce some immediate changes within the provisions of the present Papua and New Guinea Act which will give Ministerial Members drawn from the Papua and New Guinea House of Assembly increased <span class="highlight">powers</span> both individually in relation to the functions of their departments and collectively as members of the Administrator’s Executive Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The House will be aware that, following on the talks which your Committee sought with representatives of the Commonwealth Government in February last, there have been announcements in the Governor-General’s Speech and by the Minister for External Territories in the House of Representatives of steps that the Commonwealth Government intends to take immediately to give increased <span class="highlight">powers</span> to ministerial members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Would not he agree that we have the skills; that having spent $300ni on the Fill we surely have the money; and that with the great <span class="highlight">powers</span> about to quit South East Asia the need for an Australian aircraft industry was never greater? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During his period in this chamber he has stood up to a lot of abuse and a lot of attacks, but tonight it was beyond his <span class="highlight">powers</span> of endurance to listen in silence to  Dr Evatt  being attacked, and he said: ‘I will not have the old doc attacked’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first amendment was designed to take away all the control and power of the River Murray Commission because it was proposed, basically, to vest all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> in a national water conservation and constructing authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It pointed out that the existing Printing Committees of both Houses could not undertake the task as they were severely restricted in their <span class="highlight">powers</span>, ft went on to recommend, therefore, that a joint committee should be appointed with power not only to review the printing and publication of both parliamentary and government publications but also to undertake the function of the existing Printing Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>You have suggested that the new Standing Order for each House might be framed in such a way as to enable each House, independently, through its Committee, to continue to exercise the existing Printing Committee function of considering which petitions and papers presented to that House should be printed whilst providing that when sitting together as a joint committee, the intended additional responsibilities and <span class="highlight">powers</span> may be exercised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition, the Office will have a staff appointed or employed under the Public Service Act, and the Bill provides for the First Parliamentary Counsel to have, in relation to the officers in that staff, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of a Permanent Head of a Department under the Public Service Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I listened to that statement I thought: Here is one classic case where one form of totalitarianism was successfully resisted by a country without the need to have western <span class="highlight">powers</span> stationed there.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not unmindful of the fact that sometimes <span class="highlight">powers</span>, whether they be large or small, provoke other nations, but it has always been a source of wonderment to me that previous arguments advanced by the Government to attack the Opposition are discounted by present Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Grand strategy, as I define it, represents the national interest, not according to the accepted historical concept that strategy is the function of the armed forces but according to the enlarged concept which under the pressure of Communist <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the world has had to be developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever difficulties may have led to the delay in promulgating these regulations, the Senate ought not to countenance such a fundamental denial of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Parliament as is embodied in these regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that respect 1 would ask  Senator Lawrie  in particular, in view of his last remarks, to listen to the point of view that once legislation is passed that approves the appointment of a special tribunal, it would be a matter of grave concern if anybody suggested the deferment of the exercise of that tribunal and its <span class="highlight">powers</span> just because there had been an administrative hitch with regard to gazetting the remuneration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With respect lo organisations within health insurance, the National Health Act contains certain provisions relating to these organisations (see sections 30, 74, 7 J, 76, 78, 79 and 82), but the Committee is concerned that the principal <span class="highlight">powers</span>, to cancel or suspend the registration nf an organisation, have not been used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These provisions will give the Minister very wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to supervision of the funds and their investments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The exercise or performance of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> or functions of the Committee is not affected by reason only of there being a vacancy or vacancies in the membership of the Committee. “ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, those who are so recognised in a State have that statutory protection, but in accordance with the views that I expressed earlier, and as I understand the views expressed by  Senator Murphy,  it is appropriate when <span class="highlight">powers</span> such as these are imposed - and it is a desirable course which should commend itself to the Committee - that the decisions of the committees should be acted upon and given effect to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If any person who has been appointed to one of these bodies were dismissed by some whim of the Minister in accordance with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that he could exercise, I suggest that these bodies in themselves would be sufficient protection for the professional standing of the people on these bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For those reasons I think that to circumscribe the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister except for good and sufficient reason would be imprudent at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 7 (<span class="highlight">Powers</span> of the Corporation). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I. understood the Minister, the answer he gave was that this provision is desirable because if the Corporationborrows money overseas it is necessary that the lender be assured in some way that the borrowing by the Corporation is within its charter or <span class="highlight">powers</span>, andthat insome way this is required in order to give a business efficacy to the transaction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understood the Minister, it is as if the Corporation could not borrow unless this provision were in the Bill.I know that that, on the face of it, sounds like an argumentof tremendous weight, but I suggest to him that it is possibly not as weighty as it would appear to be, because the Corporation is a corporation which is set up by statute and which in clause  7  is given the widest possible <span class="highlight">powers</span> to do anything that it considers necessary or convenient to be done for the performance of its functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If its purpose is to validate something that may be outside the <span class="highlight">powers</span> granted to the Corporation by this clause, it obviously means that those <span class="highlight">powers</span> are being overridden, and that is the validating effect that sub-clause  (7.) <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the exercise of ils <span class="highlight">powers</span> the Corporation is not subject to direction by or on behalf of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think the clause is a usurpation of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The exercise of any <span class="highlight">powers</span> by the Corporation is not valid, and shall not be called into question, by reason of any failure of the Corporation to comply wilh any of its obligations under this section. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Every power that a standing committee would have, that is, the power to call’ witnesses, the power to call for documents and the power to do any of these things, all of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> reside in the Senate and in the Committees of the Senate but because of our numbers it would be cumbrous to do that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It does not mean greater <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have particularly wide <span class="highlight">powers</span>, I understand, to amend legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This may amount to the conferring upon the Board of the wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the Minister has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears to me that there is no limit to the steps which may be taken, the arrangements which may be made and the agreements which may bc entered into, lt also imposes <span class="highlight">powers</span> which very directly enter into the field of State laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so, I should refer also to clause 7, which entitles the Minister to authorise the Board to carry out any of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> granted to him under clause 6. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 22 provides that the functions of the Board are, in addition to the making of recommendations to the Minister with regard to the exercise of his <span class="highlight">powers</span>, to exercise any power delegated to it and to carry out such other functions related to the attainment of the object of this legislation as the Minister determines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I suggest to the Senate that it would be a great mistake to have the Board’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> limited in such a way that attainment of the objective of the legislation, which is the overall conversion to a metric system of weights and measures as the exclusive method of measuring physical quantities, is restricted in any way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matter of constitutional authority has also received attention and evidence submitted to the Committee tended to establish that the Commonwealth has, through a coalescence of <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the fields of taxation, defence, external affairs and other areas, sufficient legislative competence to establish a national approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In addition, other amendments are proposed which are designed mainly to widen the borrowing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Wool Board in order that the Wool Board can rebuild and renovate the wool stores which are at present placed under its control and to construct and equip integrated wool selling complexes, if this is required by the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700612_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally I turn to the provisions of the Bill intended to widen the borrowing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Wool Board to permit the Board to borrow money for the rebuilding and renovation of its existing wool stores and for the possible establishment of integrated wool selling centres, as well as to pledge its assets for such borrowings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700612_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to the proposed borrowing <span class="highlight">powers</span> for the reconstruction of the existing wool stores and for the establishment of integrated wool selling complexes, any borrowings under this power will require the approval of the Minister for Primary Industry with the concurrent of the Treasurer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700612_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Opportunity has also been taken to bring the existing borrowing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Board in relation to the Australian Wool Testing Authority into line with those for wool stores and complexes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700612_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the encouragement and support given by some members of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party to the North Vietnamese, Vietcong and aggressive Communist imperialism, and acknowledging that China and Romania have purchased rams and that the Soviet Union has expressed interest in purchasing rams, will the Minister draw the attention of trade unions to the fact that the ban is opposed to the principle of solidarity of Communist <span class="highlight">powers</span> expressed by some members of the Australian Labor Party and sections of the Australian trade union movement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In light of the repeal of the Industrial Court’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> under section 109 in relation to breaches of awards the Bill repeals section 109a of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I will illustrate my point in this way: Let us suppose that the Regulations and Ordinances Committee reported that regulations should be disallowed because in its opinion it was beyond the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Act to make the regulations, purely on the basis of legality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Commonwealth took over the taxing <span class="highlight">powers</span> from the States - that is, the whole of the income taxation power - and uniform taxation was introduced, I do not suppose there was any consideration whatever of whether there was uniformity in income taxation amongst the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-64-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is on public record as having stated Labor’s belief that Senate <span class="highlight">powers</span> on financial matters should be only those of consultation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-64-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must remember of course that  Sir Henry  Bolte was the first of the Premiers of this country to implement additional taxing <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the intention of the Government is to establish  such  a system and to change sections of the Act to do so, and while it lakes certain penal <span class="highlight">powers</span> out of the Act, it restores the ability of the Commission to apply the bans clauses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Massive penalties have been imposed on the trade union movement under the present <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the arbitration system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the legislation was introduced the Government indicated that the use of these contempt <span class="highlight">powers</span> would be rare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the cases were quite disgraceful because of the abuse of these <span class="highlight">powers</span>, and even the Government has come to realise that the law cannot stand as it is at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know the practices which were part of the abuse of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> where proceedings were brought in respect of stoppages at every separate establishment even though there was a general stoppage which, in any man’s language, ought to have been treated as one breach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If what was happening was wrong, if there was abuse - that seems to be generally conceded - and if these orders were made in the course of that abuse of these <span class="highlight">powers</span>, which even in the Government’s view were intended to be used sparingly and in exceptional cases, in that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> in fact were used as a most common means instead of conciliation and arbitration being used and resort was had constantly and abusively to these exceptional <span class="highlight">powers</span>, why should the fines and costs that were imposed stand? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, we are discussing the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> of that Court, over the period of history that we know, have been built up on a different set of standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am referring again to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same people who exploit this country are using the Court and its <span class="highlight">powers</span> to discipline the people who have the best commodity of all - the capacity to produce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Court make it legal for the owners of industry to force the working man to receive less and less of what he produces, ls it any wonder that everyone on this side of the chamber wants lo oppose this clause? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the things that are in the soul of the ordinary working man and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the court are the things that are restraining him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is to be conciliation, if there is to be industrial peace and if we are to accept the Government’s proposition that it wants to have industrial peace - I do not believe that it wants industrial peace at all; I bel’ieve that it wants to have penal <span class="highlight">powers</span> to impose on the unions whether that will produce peace or not - then surely one of the essential requirements of industrial peace is conciliation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The avoidance of disruption in industrial affairs is far too important to be left to this playing of politics and listening to the Metal Trades Employers’ Association, which is, 1 suppose, the organisation which has been guilty of the most abuse of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> given under the Act by unnecessarily instituting court actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, employers used the penal <span class="highlight">powers</span> quite capriciously in an endeavour finally to break the trade union movement - not only the craft unions but also the professional unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Section 111 of the Act provides the contempt of court <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No matter what persuasive <span class="highlight">powers</span> are used, no-one can persuade a group of people to act against their interests and support another point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Possibly during the Committee stage we shall be able to amend it so that it will have greater effect than the present penal <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the result, no State enacted complementary legislation, but Tasmania, by the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Powers</span> (Trade Practices) Act 1966, made a reference to the Commonwealth, and an unsuccessful attempt to pass similar legislation was made in South Australia in 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-104-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What <span class="highlight">powers</span> does he possess in granting charter flight rights between Australia and Europe, to ensure that the passengers involved have adequate meals en route and are not forced to follow a policy of bringing along a cut lunch? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700820_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The old regulation 112 gave the Board substantial discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span>, although it did refer to objective criteria in part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700820_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Board was set up by statute as an independent body for the purpose of exercising discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span> and making administrative decisions which must be exercised and made by some authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700820_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I want to make is that  if  it is necessary to have these <span class="highlight">powers</span> they should be conferred by the legislative process of passing legislation through the Parliament rather than through the medium of  a  regulation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700820_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the reason why there is a need for discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to descriptions of qualifications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700820_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a question of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Parliament as against the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700820_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are dealing with discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span> because someone may gain out of the operation of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700820_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister said so many times, when there are discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span> in existence someone may be treated unjustly, no matter how innocent the action may be, and therefore there has to be a right of appeal to a higher authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700820_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is said: ‘Although you have the power and you have the duty to act in accordance with your lights under the Acts Interpretation Act and in accordance with the principles that the Senate has established, you should not exercise the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that have been conferred upon this chamber and you should not perform your duty because by doing so you will cause some confusion’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700820_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate ought resolutely to exercise its <span class="highlight">powers</span> and cany out its duties to deter that kind of conduct on the part of people who ought to have more regard for the standards that have clearly been set out by the Senate’s Regulations and Ordinances Committee over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700820_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have long been an advocate for a National Drought Authority whereby the Commonwealth and States can get together on a permanent basis to take all possible steps under their joint <span class="highlight">powers</span> to plan ahead to meet the problem of major droughts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a fear shared with Russia by the Western <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must also consider how our policies should be devised to safeguard our own national interests and those of friendly <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would not do this alone but in conjunction wilh other <span class="highlight">powers</span> such as the United Kingdom and France, which has some interest in the Indian Ocean area, and perhaps the United States, which is showing an interest in the area although not a very strong one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I referred to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and said that I would like to feel that when the chips were down we had an alliance of some sort between the nuclear <span class="highlight">powers</span> - Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I make no apology for my belief that the Arab <span class="highlight">powers</span> would do a lot better if they tried to lift the standard of living of their people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that be in the various parties who have communications with their colleagues in the House of Representatives heard that the House was to discuss this matter and that it was to be discussed by the Senate and perhaps they could have tipped us the wink before the decision was made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700827_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I imagine that many suggestions on it could be made because it deals wilh the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of chairmen, the functions of chairmen, the mode of reporting and the form of reports; and, unless all these matters are concluded on Thursday afternoon so that the Estimates then stand ready for reference to the committees on resolution of the Senate, no machinery will be operating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sincerely believe that a committee of this Senate with all its <span class="highlight">powers</span> will reveal to all Australians the problems confronting the blind, the deaf and the dumb, the cerebral palsy cases, the mentally and physically handicapped, the crippled, the spastics and the quadraplegics, their needs and their requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are entitled to and we will continue to speak against this involvement and to speak against the Government when it uses improperly its <span class="highlight">powers</span> to exclude persons such as  Mr Gregory  entering the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Why is this Government entitled to abuse the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which have been given to it for certain purposes in order to deny freedom of speech in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am reminded that at the time of the referendum our <span class="highlight">powers</span> to deal with subversive bodies a Polish member of the Communist Party named Gerhardt Eisler was involved in a problem in the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The commission, therefore, has been given a very considerable degree of autonomy and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister are, generally speaking, limited to a power of approval on a relatively few matters of policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Predicting longer strikes and total stoppages,  Mr Mundey  says that tactics in strikes particularly since 1949 have been so tailored as to give a high priority to the penal <span class="highlight">powers</span> threat and thus the need to ‘get them back to work’ to avoid fines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the removal of some of the teeth from the penal <span class="highlight">powers</span> in May 1969, longer strikes including general strikes are likely to become the order of the day.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another matter to which 1 refer  -  I am not referring to unionists here - is the complete contempt shown for our judiciary and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions given to the judiciary by the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the community condones such contempt, this will be an attack on the institution of Parliament from which judicial <span class="highlight">powers</span> stem and which we have long regarded as being part of our democratic way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I say to  Senator Bull  who talked about the effrontery shown by the trade union movement towards the arbitration court is that everybody knows that this Government admits that the present penal <span class="highlight">powers</span> are not appropriate and that they ought to be modified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have a situation in which the Party to which  Senator Bull  belongs has proposed a modification of the penal <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the arbitration court in order to make them more consistent with the aims of ordinary arbitration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The States collected it in good faith until the High Court declared that it was ultra vires their <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find on all sides rh difficulties which are brought about because of a division of <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the lack of a financial structure which will permit a responsibility in government in the States and an autonomy which will enable the States to enact what they consider to be best for their local area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is something which has developed over the years as a result of wartime exigencies, decisions of the High Court of Australia and ingenious and unintended applications of <span class="highlight">powers</span> by the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances, as I see the position, there is a need for the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are exercised by the Commonwealth Government and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are exercised by the State governments to be considered wilh a view to determining whether they are the appropriate heads of power in 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that without anything else there could be at least an inquiry, an investigation in some depth, with a view to determining whether some of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the States should not be properly transferred to the Commonwealth and. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>indeed, whether some of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth could not be properly exercised by the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In February of this year the Premiers Conference at which the States had expected to have their State income tax <span class="highlight">powers</span> restored to them, or at least where they made an appeal for those <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be restored to them, was concluded with an assurance by the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  that consultations between State and Commonwealth Treasury officials would provide some means of resolving this position by the time the June conference of Premiers took place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Act, amongst other things, provided <span class="highlight">powers</span> covering the establishment of new lights and the maintenance and improvement of coastal lighthouses and other marine marks that were being taken over from the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is impossible with the great expansion of Commonwealth activities in this field for the Minister to be personally involved in the exercise of all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the section. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is thus proposed that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> set out in this section should be exercised in the ordinary way by Commonwealth officers, with the Minister having the overriding responsibility, as must always be the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore they regard the Australian presence as an indication of our participation in their security and as a guarantee that there is an interest in the preservation of the integrity of those new nations who do not wish to be subverted so early in the history of their independence from the colonial <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the Regulations and Ordinance Committee moving to disallow the many discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are given to the Executive, we have nearly eliminated this discretion from regulations and ordinances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 can remember on one occasion in Western Australia when the C series index indicated that there should be a rise in the basic wage, the  president  of the State Arbitration Court, under the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that he claimed he had, and which he undoubtedly did have, said that he would not increase the basic wage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>And whereas the Governments of the Commonwealth and of the States have decided, in the national interest, that, ‘ without raising questions concerning, and without derogating ‘ from, their respective constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>, they should cooperate for the purpose of ensuring the legal effectiveness of authorities to explore for or to exploit the petroleum resources of those submerged lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It cannot be said in the terms of the legal advice which was open to both the States and the Commonwealth in 1962 to 1964 that there was any derogation of the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth and the States in the course they followed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Equally, the problems of the States in maintaining their claims were not of such little consequence that they could be ignored and, as the States themselves conceded, the amplitude of their claim to <span class="highlight">powers</span> was such that they required for their complete exercise complementary action by the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both the States and the Commonwealth, by proceeding independently and expecting a legal challenge and decision in the High Court, were open to the risk that such claims as they made as to their <span class="highlight">powers</span> would be wholly or partly rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 2 principal factors with which the Bill is concerned are the widening of the terminology of the Act to include modern navigational aids, electronic aids and other radio aids which have come into existence in recent years, and also the delegation of <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister for Shipping and Transport  (Mr Sinclair)  to some of the officers in his Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701014_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In regard to Aboriginal advancement the Commonwealth Government does not have exclusive <span class="highlight">powers</span> or responsibilities but, as in other matters provided under section 51 of the Constitution, it shares these with the States, subject, of course, to the proviso that in case of conflict of Federal and State laws, it is the Federal taw which prevails. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701027_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This promise will, of course, be kept but I know that the Senate will share my desire that in keeping it we should to the greatest possible extent cooperate with the States rather than use the overriding <span class="highlight">powers</span> of Commonwealth legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701027_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 shall explain them to the Parliament because I think there is the possibility of abuse of such wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> as we are giving to the Governor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701027_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we look at the principal Act we see that the Governor-General had certain <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701027_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 51 of the Constitution gives us ample power to introduce legislation without giving the Governor-General these extensive <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701027_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Greenwood  observed that the States have the capacity to pass laws having extra-territorial effect, but that there are certain sensible limitations, i would rather think that the authority for that and for whatever the States do comes not from the Imperial law but from sections 106 and 107 of our Constitution, which preserve the State constitutions and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the State parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701027_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main point he, made is that the Governor-General has very great <span class="highlight">powers</span> to make ordinances which can apply for lengthy periods before either House of the Parliament has a chance to disallow them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701027_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I think his argument is all the stronger if one considers them as law making <span class="highlight">powers</span>, irrespective of whether they operate in the Territory or, in some special circumstances, outside of the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701027_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 believe that the purposes of the Committee in examining regulations and ordinances are, first, to see that there is no arbitrary exercise of discretion by the Executive - that undue discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span> are not given to it; secondly, to see that the rights and liberties of the subject are not unnecessarily interfered with; thirdly, that matters which should properly be dealt with by legislation are not included in regulations and ordinances; fourthly - I believe this is a very important point which does attract the attention of the Committee - that if there are circumstances where the Commit tee believes that any of these matters have arisen, they should be of sufficient substance to warrant a resolution from the Committee that the regulation or ordinance not be accepted by the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me to be a shame that we have had to linger on until 1970 to bring about these dramatic and important changes but I must say also - I am sure you will agree with me,  Mr Acting Deputy President  - that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of inertia are strong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There would not have been so much objection to the inclusion of this provision if it had referred only to an approved bank because the money would have been kept within the banking system and, because of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Reserve Bank, we would have had some control over the interest rates charged on the money borrowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This article states: lj) the general introductory note, the Mover of the Bill gives it die appearance of being a mere General revision’ of police <span class="highlight">powers</span>, to ‘keep pace with developments’ and to ‘keep pace with change in the law’ in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>(hat the present police <span class="highlight">powers</span> are oldfashioned and inadequate, and that other democratic countries have found this to be so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Later in his second reading speech, the Secretary for Law spoke of the existing common law <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the discussions in the Territory which bad led to the circulation of some Administration amendments to the original Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker I suspect thatmany who have complained that the Bill gives greatly increased <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the police have  in  fact been unaware how extensive are the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the police have at common law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">powers</span> have existed in Australia and in England  for  hundreds of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Now, for the first time  in  this Territory we are setting some of those <span class="highlight">powers</span> down in written form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>this project of setting down police <span class="highlight">powers</span> in statutory form, the committee of the International Commission of Jurists had this to say: The Committee, whilst feeling compelled to be critical of certain provisions of the proposedBill accepts none the less the wisdom of attempting to embody in a single Ordinance the legislative provisions relating to the maintenance of public order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It appreciates also the endeavour to clarify and codify the provisions relating to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the police in relation thereto. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The law will have many <span class="highlight">powers</span> over a man who has who has been named as a ‘trouble maker’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Their <span class="highlight">powers</span> should not be based on expediency to make their work much easier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This brings to my mind a situation in Port Moresby when police officers co-operated with customs officers and used the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Department of Customs to raid houses in Port Moresby in areas to which the Customs Act did not apply in order to gain evidence which would lead to a conviction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unfortunate if an impression is created that it is using its <span class="highlight">powers</span> and its representation in order to have foisted on the Territory provisions which are objectionable and which ought not to be tolerated in a community in which we are seeking to establish a set of laws and a constitution which will observe at least a minimum of the basic human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Percy  Chatterton, a white member of the House of Assembly, said that the more powerful the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the police, the more powerful the checks on these <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to be quite brief, but I think I should point out that  Senator Murphy  graced himself by saying that it is unfortunate that <span class="highlight">powers</span> of such an objectionable character have been foisted upon the people of Papua and New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When it introduced the present national service scheme the Government acted in accordance with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred on it by the Constitution and it did so after an exhaustive review of defence policy and several years experience had indicated it was the only way to increase the strength of the Regular Army to the extent necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To enable this assistance to be given we on this side feel that these Acts in Queensland and in Western Australia should be repealed or that the Commonwealth should use its <span class="highlight">powers</span> to transcend State <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Government has all of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> over Aborigines and Islanders on Reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Within the preliminary to the 1965 act, Parliament specified that all existing reserves were to continue as such (S.4 (11)).It is important to examine the extent and generality of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> assigned to the Manager and to the department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most general <span class="highlight">powers</span> are contained in Regulations 10-13 and apply to ‘every resident on or visitor to’ the reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The wide scope of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> is easily susceptible to misuse and gives to the manager almost absolute power over the actions of all on the reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The scope of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> allotted to the manager give him a considerable degree of control over such convictions and thus over who is eligible to stand for election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to know, with all due respect to the legislation, in view of the fact that we live adjacent to Japan and other maritime <span class="highlight">powers</span> are there any other equivalent consultative bodies as distinct from this NATO group through which we can discuss with Japan and other countries the elimination of certain oil tanker practices? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is also known - it is a regrettable fact of life - that Australia is handicapped in its presentation of views on other international affairs because of its fear that if it opens its mouth on any subject at all the other nations will hammer into Australia because it is one of the colonial <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Their argument always is that the Territory is not ready  for  self-government, but that is an attitude typical of colonial <span class="highlight">powers</span> and  it  smacks very much of racial superiority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because of the present section 40 of the Act, which provides that the Commission may delegate its <span class="highlight">powers</span>, except that of delegation itself, only to a Commissioner or the General Manager, administrative difficulties have arisen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill amends section 40 so that the Commission’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> may be delegated to any person in the employ of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the use of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> set out in the Bill will prevent any hitches in what must, of necessity, be a tightly-scheduled and close-knit operation, if the 10-year mapping programme is to be completed on time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendment dealing with the administration of the Australian Broadcasting Commission relate to the delegation <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission, and new financial and banking provisions, and repeal a section which limited compensation to a member of the Commission or to an officer or employee of the Commission to a mere $500 unless ministerial approval for a higher amount was authorised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that the delegation <span class="highlight">powers</span> regarding appointment of permanent officers could well be further extended than they have been by this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Section 41 of the Act authorises the Commission to delegate to a commissioner or to an officer of the Commission all or any <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission except the power to appoint officers of the Commission and, of course, to delegate the power of delegation itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Limiting <span class="highlight">powers</span> to a Commissioner or the General Manager created an untenable position and in fact the Commission has had to resort to the device of issuing authorisations’ to enable persons down the line lo exercise the <span class="highlight">powers</span> they needed to exercise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is some worry as to whether he was not even treasonable during the war because, although he gave lip service to being on the side of the Western <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the Chinese troops had their base in Chungking, they very rarely fought Japanese troops; they were far more interested in attacking Mao’s troops. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For many years the western <span class="highlight">powers</span> had recognised China’s claim that Tibet is a province of China, Whatever the present government in Peking has done in Tibet is no different to what preceding Chinese governments have done and what the government of Chiang Kai-shek himself would do if he were in power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill also seeks to repeal section 6 of the Air Navigation Act 1920-1966, which was inserted in 1960 to confer legal capacity on ICAO in Australia and to confer on it the privileges and immunities necessary for the independent exercise of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> and performance of its functions in Australian territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister whether it is correct, as  Senator Rae  has pointed out, that in the situation he referred to a constable would have the power to arrest - in effect, to exercise the power of the court, to penalise or to have injunctive <span class="highlight">powers</span>, if I might call them that - to prevent a breach of the peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The consideration we have already mentioned is of necessity an answer to this contention, namely, that in unequivocal terms the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the House of Commons have been bestowed upon the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the provisions of the Constitution the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the House of Commons vested in the House of Representatives are also vested in this Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be added to that very simple statement that throughout the- course of English history there has been a tendency to regard those <span class="highlight">powers</span> as . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not the occasion to discuss the historical grounds upon which these <span class="highlight">powers</span> and privileges attached to the House of Commons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But our decision is based upon the ground that a general view of the Constitution and the separation of <span class="highlight">powers</span> is not a sufficient reason for giving to those words, which appear to us to be so clear, a restrictive or secondary meaning which they do not properly bear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When one examines tribunals which are not exercising judicial <span class="highlight">powers</span> one should postulate that above all they should have regard to their responsibilities, to the rights of individuals and act fairly by everybody. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the Court held that, due to the way in which the Trade Practices Act sought to utilise all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> believed to be available to sustain the legislation, it was open to legal objection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is satisfied that legislation thus based entirely on the corporations power will cover the vast majority of significant restrictive practices that could be covered by Commonwealth legislation if reliance were placed on all available <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, to my mind one of the fundamental errors into which the Court was led by the reserved <span class="highlight">powers</span> doctrine when deciding Huddart Parker v. Moorehead (supra) was the endeavour to do that very thing rather than merely to decide whether the law which it had before it was a law with respect to the topic of granted power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think it is a good thing that such <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be left to reside in the High Court due to the failure of the other constitutional processes to operate and give viability to the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In mid-June, 1971 the Soviet Union advised the other four nuclear weapon states - the United States, Britain, France and the People’s Republic of China - that it ‘proposed to convene at the earliest time a conference of the Five <span class="highlight">Powers</span> possessing nuclear weapons.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They expressed the view that the proposal would otherwise have merited serious consideration, but that such a conference would require the participation of all five nuclear <span class="highlight">powers</span> to make it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1  am aware that a decision was given in the Northern Territory Supreme Court yesterday by  Mr Justice  Forster in regard to an action which was brought by the Attorney-General against certain members of the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory who had purported by resolution to appoint persons with what might be described as ombudsman-like <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The issue which was litigated before the Supreme Court did not relate to Commonwealth constitutional power but to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Northern Territory Legislative Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In my understanding of the matter, based upon a rough outline of the case and the Press reports, no question arose in that case which affects the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of Senate committees, insofar as those committees are aids to the exercise of a legislative function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I return to my reference to the fact that a higher standard of education, wider knowledge and a deeper understanding of the whole purpose of living and of life gives more people within our community greater <span class="highlight">powers</span> of discrimination and wiser judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Failing that, and although it might test the validity of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of Senate committees, I shall raise the matter with the appropriate Estimates Committee when it is dealing with the Prime Minister’s Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We feel that it is quite wrong for taxing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this nature - income tax and payroll tax - to be in the hands of 6 separate authorities representing the States and of a Federal authority which, by the operation of the Pay-roll Tax (Territories) Assessment Bill and the Pay-roll Tax (Territories) Bill, will still have some control in certain areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>lt has been stated already that the States agreed on a different rate from that which had been levied by the Commonwealth, tut, of course, this is one of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the States had and they agreed to do this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first Bill relates to the termination of the Commonwealth taxing <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the other 2 Bills relate to the introduction of the taxing <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the levying of payroll tax in the Commonwealth Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth agreement arose from a desire by the Commonwealth to grant to the States a growth tax which was constitutionally possible for them to levy and one which would give them a degree of growth and some taxing <span class="highlight">powers</span> to enable them to apply their own priorities to some of their expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Broadly stated, these <span class="highlight">powers</span> will enable the Commonwealth in its Territories to impose payroll tax at the same rate of  2i  per cent, which was the rate under the previous Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Had there been, as  Senator Murphy  has suggested, the speedy introduction of legislation - one way of doing that might have ben to increase the deposit requirement or, as he suggested, to give wider <span class="highlight">powers</span> to an investigator - the risk would have been that there would be a crop of failures which would undermine public confidence and cause a run on other insurance companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711027_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While an answer to a question without notice is not the occasion on which to express an opinion on legal or constitutional issues, it does appear to me that the honourable senator’s suggestion of a lower rate of duty on aviation fuel used on flights to and from Tasmania would constitute discrimination between the States on a law relating to taxation, lt would therefore be beyond the Commonwealth’s <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711028_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite possible that the whole confrontation of the great <span class="highlight">powers</span> may be passing from the European mainland to the basin of the Pacific, which may well be the cockpit in which the great <span class="highlight">powers</span> will confront one another in years to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My leader,  Senator Gair,  went on a television programme the other night and pointed out the necessity for it, with 2 major <span class="highlight">powers</span> armed to the teeth as Russia and China are in the Pacific area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we are sensible we are inevitably led to the fact, whatever the consequences are, that Japan, which is a free agent, which has a population of 100 million people and which is the greatest economic power in the area, has to take steps to arm itself - unless we go there and prevent the Japanese from rearming - to compete with those major <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are not friendly towards it and which are so close to its shores <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let nobody think that the emergence of China on the public scene is being accepted with unadulterated glee by the great super <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same situation applies to Russia in relation to these matters, because Australia is geographically situated under an arc of 4 great <span class="highlight">powers</span> - America, Russia, Japan and China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude with this thought: Australia has a major role to play here because, apart from the 5 great super <span class="highlight">powers</span>, there are some 250 million sometimes forgotten people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But alongside America I believe that Australia has an individual and unique role to play, moving around South East Asia, collecting the viewpoints of the peoples of Asia and communicating them to the big <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the AttorneyGeneral: What <span class="highlight">powers</span> does the Commonwealth Government have in relation to compulsory unionism and the protection of the rights of individuals who do not wish to join a union? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 ask the Attorney-General whether his attention has been drawn to the annual report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board which indicates that the Secretary of Television Corporation Ltd which holds the licence for TCN Sydney and which controls GTV in Melbourne has challenged the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that industry there is a statutory marketing authority which has specific <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Senate were to express the opinion that there should be complementary legislation to establish a single statutory marketing authority to acquire, appraise and market the entire wool clip it would mean that that authority would have to be armed with statutory <span class="highlight">powers</span> to limit production and so on, especially if it were made responsible for the absorption of the entire crop, as happens in the sugar industry in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I realise that the Secretary of the Department of the Primary Industry is provided under the Bill with discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span> to recognise these people, but I believe that it would have been much simpler if the wording had been changed in the manner that I have suggested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would not be possible without the introduction of this legislation as the Commissioner would be left without effective persuasive <span class="highlight">powers</span> to handle industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result of the concrete pipes case the judges of the High Court now say that the decision given in 1909 in respect of Commonwealth <span class="highlight">powers</span> over trade and industry was wrong in several points. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they are entitled to rights or the ability to exercise <span class="highlight">powers</span>, they should know what those rights and those <span class="highlight">powers</span> are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This seems to me to touch upon the question of whether there is a true separation of <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that this provision exists in some other legislation but it one starts to look at the substance of the doctrine that there should be a separation of <span class="highlight">powers</span>, it seems to me - looking at the matter broadly - that if a person is appointed to be a judge under some legislation and under some other legislation is appointed to cany out administrative duties then we are breaking down the separation of <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this practice is to become more common it will in relation to the separation of <span class="highlight">powers</span> certainly be a different picture, from that which we had envisaged after the boilermakers case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But on the other hand, his definition is simply:  monopoly <span class="highlight">powers</span>’ means the power to fix, or influence substantially, the market price of any kind of goods or services, or to prevent persons entering or expanding businesses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is now needed is a new code of family law created by a combined effort of the States and Commonwealth so that within the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the latter, a new divorce and marriage code may be created, drafted in the context of the new provisions on the subjects within the State sphere, which could be enacted as uniform legislation by the several States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the Parliament can establish, by the marriage and divorce and matrimonial causes <span class="highlight">powers</span>, by force of legislation, by a legislative declaration, the rights, liabilities, obligations and status that the parties would have had if the purported decrees had been valid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I a?k: In view of the many changed demands made on local authorities and the changes in urban and rural growth, will the Minister give consideration to initiating some inquiry at Commonwealth and State levels into the distribution of local and State <span class="highlight">powers</span>  so  that local authorities upon which increasing demands are being made will be able to function more effectively? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 10 provides for the insertion of a new section in the Aci (section 48n), which will empower the Director to advance money on mortgage to an ineligible person for the purpose of effecting a sale when exercising the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of sale conferred by section 36’, section 48 and section 48c of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the usual practice of the Director is to sell properties under the <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred in these sections to eligible persons, it is sometimes necessary to effect a sale to an ineligible person, Where, for example, the properly is no longer suitable for sale to an eligible person, or where an eligible person is not available to purchase the property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed it is, because it involves an examination of the language of the Broadcasting and Television Act, the obligations of the Commission and, to some extent, the rights and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of -the Estimates committees which have been constituted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The matter has to be treated with some care because if the Parliament, by an Act, has established a corporation and has delineated the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions of that corporation, I would think the Parliament would respect the rights of persons to act under that charter given by the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>for example, the commissioners - or the General Manager - of the Australian Broadcasting Commission believe that they are acting in accordance with the law, in accordance with an Act of Parliament, they may question whether there are any express or implied <span class="highlight">powers</span> for one House of the Parliament to interfere with that which the law has accorded them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I acknowledge his authority in that area but 1 say again to the AttorneyGeneral, as he knows I have said lo him on many occasions during the course of directing questions to him, that our Committee had a considerable amount of advice which led us quite firmly to put down on paper that we believed and we felt that there was a sufficient coalescence of <span class="highlight">powers</span> for the Commonwealth at least to take a more active, a more leading and a more positive role than in my view it is taking at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think anybody would wish to intrude into those cases the custodial <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are provided for in section 29aa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is satisfied that the interests of this nation’s economy, growth and welfare, as well as the interests of all those persons and corporations, both within and without Australia, who are involved in the Australian securities industry require that the Commonwealth Government exercise the <span class="highlight">powers</span> given to it at federation to legislate with respect to the securities industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They took with them  Sir William’s  seven terms of reference, which featured acquisition of the wool clip, production controls, amalgamation of the board and the Commission, and new <span class="highlight">powers</span> for the IWS. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this plan involves the study of the following courses of action: The amalgamation of the Australian Wool Board and the Australian Wool Commission and the composition, <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions of the new body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Rectification of the unemployment that is being caused in Western Australia is beyond the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Western Australian Government without some assistance from the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>ThereforeI think it could be said that there has been an accord as to the terms of reference and also as to the formal parts of the motion dealing with the staff and personnel of the Committee as well as its rights and <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think also it is even more incorrect to look on the problems which have to be resolved if we are to have peaceful relations with our neighbours in the Indian Ocean as being solely the result of the intervention of major <span class="highlight">powers</span>, whether they be Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union or China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposition 1 wish to put to the Senate, and I do not wish to speak at great length on it, is that it is time we forgot about the stories of gunboats of foreign <span class="highlight">powers</span> coming into the Indian Ocean; that it is time we had a look at the peoples of the Indian Ocean themselves; that it is time we had a look at our immigration policy; that it is time we had a look at our aid programme; that it is time we had a look at the policies we adopt on colonialism in South Africa, Rhodesia and the Portuguese colonies; that it is time we ceased to find in reports of the United Nations General Assembly or in conferences which take place elsewhere that there is a hard core of three or four countries such as South Africa, Portugal and Australia supporting the position of the South Africans and the Portuguese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is interesting to note - I will conclude by making some observations about this matter - that Australia has again been placed in a ludicrous position as a result of the present visit to China by  President  Nixon because, although I have already said that 1 believe the problems of the Indian Ocean area will be in the main resolved by the people who live in that area, there cannot be any doubt but that the relationships between the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> are going to play a very important role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lest it be thought that I am rattling a sword and picking out permanent enemies let me make this perfectly clear: I sought merely to establish the existing mili’ary strengths of various nations, various world <span class="highlight">powers</span>, operative in the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to put these things in perspective and against the background that one hopes that President Nixon will achieve great steps towards world peace, it would be wrong if we did not understand the nature of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is important, with all the goodwill in the world, that we recognise the nature of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> involved in this part of the world, particularly as China is building its own military presence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although it is nol possible to predict with certainty that all the great <span class="highlight">powers</span> will maintain ‘ their interest in the area indefinitely, it does not seem likely that the countries in the region, whatever their views, will be able to prevent une Indian Ocean developing into an area of great power influence a:,.d involvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They arc the major British withdrawal of forces cast of the Suez, extension of the Russian naval and economic influence in the Indian Ocean and its surrounds, the uncertainty of the intentions of the United States in the area, an anticipated large increase in exports of minerals from Western Australia, and the extension in the ocean of the influence of great <span class="highlight">powers</span> whose policies and ideologies differ from our own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senate, in debating the situation in the Indian Ocean region, were merely to look at.it from the point of view of the interests of various major <span class="highlight">powers</span> and were to consider only what will happen as a result of Britain’s withdrawal, what will happen as a result of the Soviet allegedly coming and what the United States or China might do in this part of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-133">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Pakistan, a new country which came into existence only in 1947  -  it is still less than one quarter of a century old - has split apart and the majority of the inhabitants of the former East Pakistan have constituted a new state known as Bangla Desh which is recognised already by a number of world <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-133">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 do  Dot  believe that we should look on the peoples of the Indian Ocean, as we have done so frequently in the past, as being minions or pawns to be pushed around by great <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-133">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is becoming increasingly evident is that the people of the various countries in the whole Indian Ocean area are struggling for their independence and obtaining their independence, and they are exercising their own policies without direction from foreign <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-133">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>:tce when  Dr Sukarno  was replaced as  President  by General Suharto and although it could noi be denied that there were major <span class="highlight">powers</span> that were very concerned about what was happening and were doing their best to exercise influence in Indonesia, what happened in Indonesia was an internal Indonesian conflict which was resolved, correctly or incorrectly, by Indonesians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-133">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has had to expand in depth into Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary and the other buffer countries and exercise its influence there because of the fear that the United States Central Intelligence Agency and that country’s other instrumentalities which are practically extra-governmental would undermine the people’s governments there and establish reactionary governments which would allow the Western <span class="highlight">powers</span>, with its fanatical objection to people having their own form of government, to make attacks through these bordering countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-133">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>a military and an economic sense throughout the world in competition with the United States and other Western <span class="highlight">powers</span>; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-133">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Russia, as one of 2 or 3 super <span class="highlight">powers</span>, is in competition with some other super <span class="highlight">powers</span>, notably with the United States, Japan and China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-133">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To interfere with these is to confront the major maritime <span class="highlight">powers</span>, whose navies control the waters in which the Soviet merchant fleet (second largest in numbers of ships, sixth largest in tonnage) sails. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-133">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The remainder of the States have appointed a few permanent officers with <span class="highlight">powers</span> ranging from overriding responsibility in the event of a disaster or attacks upon the civil population, but these people have little more than training and advisory func  tion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Their’s may be similar in certain respects but the <span class="highlight">powers</span> held by the States in this country make it difficult for the Commonwealth to have full control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for the Interior, the honourable member for Gwydir  (Mr Hunt),  in his maiden speech in the House of Representatives on 21st August 1969, suggested that a national drought authority should be established whereby the Commonwealth and States could get together on a permanent basis to take all possible steps under their joint <span class="highlight">powers</span> to plan ahead to meet the problem of major droughts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report states that there has been an extension of interest and participation by the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the Indian Ocean, but interestingly enough the Committee said at page 15 of the report: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, the nations in that region have encouraged the participation of the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> in their region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst there would be many people who would like to see the Indian Ocean free from the influence of the major <span class="highlight">powers</span>, the fact is that if it is the prerogative of the United States it is also the prerogative of the other major <span class="highlight">powers</span> to become involved in that region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One has to take the view that what is regarded by the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> as normal international behaviour should not be regarded in Australia as abnormal or as something that needs to worry the Australian people, lt seems to me that this is tho theme that runs through the whole document when one looks at it objectively, free from the fears that so often have been expressed in debates in this chamber and in the other place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>While the Admiral expressed some concern about the Soviet presence in this region he nevertheless came to the conclusion that it was normal international behaviour and that it related to the general security of the Soviet Union in the global conflict which we all agree still exists between some of the major <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The countries concerned engage from time to time in international conferences at the United Nations and other places and have suggested that the Indian Ocean should be declared a zone of peace: that the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> should, as far as practicable, leaving aside their own national interests, be encouraged to leave it well alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>lt has been decided to clarify the investment <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Board under the Dairy Produce Export Control Act to enable it to carry on its milk plan’ operations in the manner that it has been doing under the provisions relating to the Dairy Industry Stabilisation Fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As has been quite rightly pointed out during the course of the debate, the Indian Ocean area is very vital to the big <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The global <span class="highlight">powers</span> have begun to make their presence more clearly felt in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like the littoral countries, the world’s major trading and shipping nations, and the global <span class="highlight">powers</span>, we have our share of interests in and around the Ocean to be projected, protected and reconciled with the reasonable interests of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The next matter discussed was ‘Direct Taxes in Relation to the Division of Fiscal <span class="highlight">Powers</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I argued, just for myself, that one of the ways in which this problem could be handled would be to give the Commonwealth Grants Commission a higher status, to revive the Federal Co-ordinator of Public Works, to pick up the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Inter-State Commission and to look at managing the situation better, in the resource allocation sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In so doing they decided upon a federal system in which the centre or the Commonwealth should have limited <span class="highlight">powers</span>, quite unlike the British Constitution, that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be defined in writing and that we would be bound by those here in the centre of government whereas the Slates would then have residual <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">powers</span> that were not specified for the centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incredibly there emerged, not only out of the uniform taxing power of the defence power granted by the war but also a ruling of the High Court to the effect that the Commonwealth had parallel but not superior <span class="highlight">powers</span> on taxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Into the Constitution was written section 96 which undoubtedly was meant to give the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">powers</span> in exceptional circumstances to intervene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ruling that the Commonwealth has specific <span class="highlight">powers</span> over corporations can cause, I have no doubt, a complete widening of the frontiers of power, for better or worse, of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a discovery that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which lie within the Commonwealth Constitution are much larger than and quite different from what the founding fathers envisaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether or not power can be worked out and written down in words - we know the difficulty of lawyers in that regard - one thing we do know is that it is well nigh impossible in (his country to alter the Constitution by referendum unless we are removing <span class="highlight">powers</span> from the centre or are giving social welfare <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe, personally, that thai will happen only if income taxing <span class="highlight">powers</span> are returned to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth itself must have centralised <span class="highlight">powers</span> for defence and for the security of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It must have <span class="highlight">powers</span> to maintain the economy and the stability of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must have <span class="highlight">powers</span>, I think, to ensure the conservation and orderly development of our resources because that does not necessarily flow through decentralised States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Direct taxation in the hands of the States will not take from the Commonwealth its <span class="highlight">powers</span> over the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real <span class="highlight">powers</span> over the economy today come from fiscal policies that are far and away greater than income taxing <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these <span class="highlight">powers</span> are far greater than taxing <span class="highlight">powers</span> and all are outside this argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Cavanagh  asked me whether the States want their taxing <span class="highlight">powers</span> back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I examine that question in this way: Very great problems would be involved for the small States as merely to give them back income taxing <span class="highlight">powers</span> would be a wrong thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly, any kind of return of taxing <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the States must have with it some kind of Grants Commission formula that gives to the small States a balance no worse than that which they receive now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I would say this to the Senate: In the present situation at least 4 of the States, I would think, would not want the return of their taxing <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our complaint against this Government is that it has repeatedly and consistently failed to arm itself with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are necessary and desirable to overcome the adverse effects of inflation and to see that the economy is run reasonably in the interests of the people as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has allowed itself to become a cripple because it would not assume the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and it would not seek the legislation which would enable it to deal with the economy as it should. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was one significant example of a need for legislation, a need for the Government to arm itself by asking Parliament to give it the <span class="highlight">powers</span> to deal with such restrictive practices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that there are ample Constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> which might be drawn upon and from which the Government under appropriate legislation could arm itself to deal with the adverse effects of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">powers</span> include obviously the corporations power under the new doctrine enunciated by the High Court in the ‘Concrete Pipes case’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They include the trade and commerce <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also there are taxation <span class="highlight">powers</span> and other forms of revenue legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> such as subsidies, tariffs and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should be looking to see whether the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> enable us to set up proper machinery in order to deal wilh a real social problem which affects every person as a consumer, which affects every person as a ratepayer or taxpayer and which affects every person who has an interest in the efficiency and the prosperity of all industry and commerce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is asking the Australian people to give the Senate the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of a price fixing authority, whatever else members of the Opposition may like to call it and despite  Senator Murphy  giving me his assurances that that is not what is meant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that we should let this Parliament, and especially the Senate, indicate to the people, that it is not merely wringing its hands about inflation but, within its constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>, is examining the problem seriously in an attempt to find an answer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will be well aware that the Constitution does not mention education as an area in which the Commonwealth has particular <span class="highlight">powers</span> or responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">powers</span> and responsibilities reside specifically with the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth has made increasing use of those <span class="highlight">powers</span>, as the Constitution has allowed it to do, and has provided a growing measure of assistance to the States for the purposes of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I rest my presidential opinion on the basis that over the last 2 years or so the Senate has adopted the practice of expressing an opinion and I regard the Senate as being entitled to express an opinion irrespective of whether the ambit of the relevant Bill comes within the financial <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also clear, I suggest, that we should not found our defence policy, or our willingness to engage ourselves to assist others, on a simple faith in the success of diplomatic efforts of mighty <span class="highlight">powers</span> or on the benign intentions of rivals for ideological supremacy among communist <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time global military and economic power is being redistributed among the great military <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One may well hope that the development of the dialogue will open the way to understanding and trust which take us further away from the flash point of conflct over issues vital to great <span class="highlight">powers</span> leading possibly to the utter disaster of global war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we must also, in calculating how to defend Australia’s interests, allow for possible developments at some time in the future in which there may be acceptance of situations which, in effect, represent a change in the balance among these great <span class="highlight">powers</span> and which are not all beneficial to the confidence of countries in South East Asia and the South West Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is accordingly a matter of regret to the Australian Government that, with the ink barely dried on the agreements pertaining to the presence of the forces - international arrangements which are explicitly linked to the communique of the Five <span class="highlight">Powers</span> issued in London last April - attempts have been made to sow in the world new doubts and uncertainties about Australia’s intentions as a nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To lay stress on dangerous contingencies against which Australian defence efforts must steadily prepare over the longer term is not inconsistent with the hopes entertained by the  President  of the United States of progressively negotiating understandings which will reduce tensions among the  4  great <span class="highlight">powers</span>: The Soviet Union, the People’s Republic of China, the United States and Japan - and particularly among the  3  great military <span class="highlight">powers</span> in this group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What seems evident from the diplomacy exercised by all these <span class="highlight">powers</span> over recent months is that there is a new fluidity in which new relations may be formed, and if old security dangers recede some new ones will take their place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is, I believe, an essential ingredient of Australian diplomacy that Australia should be understood to be a country whose security interests are growing; whose population and wealth are growing; and whose determination to take some part in shaping the environment in which we live is more lively than ever now that the great western <span class="highlight">powers</span> have served notice that their involvement in lesser situations is not to be taken for granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is, of course, no part of Australian defence policy to prepare for massive defence by ourselves - whether by conventional or nuclear means - against an onslaught by one of the great military <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We expect the Commissioner to delegate certain of his <span class="highlight">powers</span>, not only to members of his own staff but also to officers in the authorities running Commonwealth school systems, with a consequential increase in flexibility and efficiency of administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-106-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">powers</span> will not have to be exercised in such a way as to impose uniformity of organisation on the school systems concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-106-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is considered that this would allow a satisfactory check to be kept on the position as there would not be enough incentive for any producer to go to this trouble to alter the whole nature of his business operation in order to create additional voting <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would say it gives the Commissioner more power because throughout the Bill the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commissioner are extraordinarily wide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am conscious of the fact that an unsuccessful attempt was made in the House of Representatives to obtain approval for the appointment of a judicial inquiry into this projected takeover of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd by Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd. To follow that process here would not have advantaged us to any extent so, as fur as I could see, the only alternative left to us was to refer this matter to an appropriate Senate committee for investigation and inquiry, that committee having the usual <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are enjoyed by similar parliamentary committees in the matter of obtaining evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that the investigatory <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Committee will enable it to inquire into that aspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>An answer would seem to be to extend the Public Service Arbitrator’s jurisdiction by tha insertion of <span class="highlight">powers</span> similar to those contained in sections 28 and 29 of the C. and A. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under that clause the arbitrator forthwith occasions a conference and then he takes such arbitrary <span class="highlight">powers</span> and such a close action in relation to whatever he wants to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this world today how can there be such arbitrary <span class="highlight">powers</span> and such a close connection between the Minister and Government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will oppose, not only in the Parliament but wherever possible, the unfair and summary <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are granted under the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I predict now that, if a change of government occurred, whichever party replaced the present Government would find the necessity to use the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this legislation and similar legislation if the philosophy of the unbridled right to strike continued to be pursued in the manner in which it is being pursued today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not been able to read all those Public Service regulations in the period available to me, but basically I do not share the view that it is the intention of the present Government, or would be the intention of any future government, to misuse these <span class="highlight">powers</span>, to take advantage of  a  set of circumstances and to force a stand-down of innocent people who, but for the stoppage of work by others, would be gainfully employed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do wish to say this much about that particular action: We had a situation in which the Postal Department and the Government in that period of some 7 or 8 weeks were put under real challenge as to their effective <span class="highlight">powers</span> and, in effect, to leadership by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was only when I discovered how limited the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Government were that I could understand why the Government did not take stronger action at the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable senator looked at the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that were available to the Government under the Public Service Act he would find that all it could do would be to initiate procedures which would have involved the suspension and ultimately the probable dismissal of the employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This measure has been attacked in the Senate on the ground that it gives very wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> to deal with certain circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it was  Senator Bishop  who dwelt on the severe effect that some of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> could have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that he is to be given already exist and have been exercised in the industrial sphere of arbitration for years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When because of inequalities, which there always will be, frustrations and things that they are induced to believe are not conducive to their advancement or betterment, people are impatient with industrial actions, or the actions of persons whose role is to act as umpire in regard to these matters, and when as a result they propose to sabotage an essential service in this country - the mail service - by proposing to cut one of the economic arteries of the country because they are not satisfied with the conditions imposed by the persons whose function is to arbitrate in these matters, is it not reasonable to expect that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that be at long last must be forced to take some concrete action? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the removal of some of the teeth from the penal <span class="highlight">powers</span> in May,  1969,  longer strikes including general strikes are likely to become the order of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that, except in very exceptional circumstances, a strike merely to better terms and conditions of employment is morally unjustifiable in any way, shape or form, if for no other reason than it inflicts hardship and penalties not upon the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that be but, in the main, upon people who have nothing at all to do with the dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The elements of a dispute may be such that it is possible to go to both the Commission and the Arbitrator, as public servants are subject to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of both the Commission and the Arbitrator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the Government to take to itself such <span class="highlight">powers</span> that although a judge may act impartially when some serious question arises in a dispute the Government can impose its will upon certain employees for the purpose of creating a dispute whenever it wants to do so? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720420_senate_27_s51/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was also asked  -  I think by  Senator Cavanagh  - where it was provided in the Bill that the Arbitrator’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to industrial situations were restricted to dealing with industrial situations involving the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720420_senate_27_s51/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand the effect of this new section, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred by proposed new sections 12c to 12e relate only to industrial situations where those situations involve the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720420_senate_27_s51/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has to be an Act that will go beyond the operation of the public service employees, an Act providing more <span class="highlight">powers</span>, an Act which is not concerned so much with settling a dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720420_senate_27_s51/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred by section 28 and section 29 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act are not applicable in relation to the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720420_senate_27_s51/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, even if this view is wrong and a conciliation commissioner purported to exercise <span class="highlight">powers</span> under those sections to conciliate in relation to an industrial dispute in the Public Service, he could not make any follow-up orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720420_senate_27_s51/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition had asked where it is provided in the Bill that the Arbitrator’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to industrial situations were restricted to dealing with industrial situations involving the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720420_senate_27_s51/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer is to be found in proposed section 1 2 (b), the effect of which is that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred by sections 12(c) to 12(e) relate only to industrial situations to the extent that they involve the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720420_senate_27_s51/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Bishop  has stated, they are not identical <span class="highlight">powers</span> to those of the Public Service Arbitrator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720420_senate_27_s51/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But now more severe <span class="highlight">powers</span> must be introduced in relation to the Commonwealth Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720420_senate_27_s51/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has taken a long time but now I think that we have it clear that as a result of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> proposed by this Bill this special section is to be treated more severely than other workers generally are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720420_senate_27_s51/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In defending that sort of prescription the Minister argued that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> available under the present Conciliation and Arbitration Act were not available to the Public Service Board or to unions representing employees in the Commonwealth Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720420_senate_27_s51/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The information I have on proposed new section 12c is as follows: Sub-section (l.) gives power to a Minister, the Public Service Board, a Commonwealth authority or an organisation to notify the Arbitrator in writing of an industrial situation that exists or is likely to occur and to make application to him to use the <span class="highlight">powers</span> given to him under these new provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720420_senate_27_s51/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A restriction on the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Arbitrator should be spelt out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720420_senate_27_s51/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">powers</span> are as wide as the unions say, there ought to be some restrictions in the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720420_senate_27_s51/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are concerned that paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section I 2d gives much wider <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Arbitrator and Deputy Arbitrator and that the Bill fails to provide adequate safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720420_senate_27_s51/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Arbitrator’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> set out in proposed new section 12d(I) are exercisable only after he has heard the submissions of all parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720420_senate_27_s51/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, will the Government make a statement, for the information of the Senate and of the public, of the implications for Australia of the new sweeping <span class="highlight">powers</span> over currency just taken by the Japanese Government and the implications of an upward revaluation by Japan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now ask: In view of suggestions that the present <span class="highlight">powers</span> over the precincts of Parliament are not as adequate as they should be, can you give any information about any proposals to improve the control of this Parliament over its precincts, particularly in view of an incident that happened in the Victorian Parliament within recent weeks? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any question of whether Commonwealth <span class="highlight">powers</span> - there are many Commonwealth <span class="highlight">powers</span>, some of which might be relevant in this area and others which I imagine would not be relevant - should at any stage be exercised by the Parliament is essentially a matter for the Government and Government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, the Senate will be aware of the view of the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> with regard to this matter which will have a considerable bearing upon the ultimate issue at the conference referred to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think I should inform honourable senators that, although the precincts of Parliament House  have  never been defined in the Commonwealth jurisdiction or the Commonwealth Parliament as they  have,  for example, by the Parliament in Victoria, to which  Senator McManus  referred, honourable senators are aware that under section 49  of  the Constitution, the <span class="highlight">powers</span>, immunities and priviledges of the Houses of Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia are the <span class="highlight">powers</span>, immmunities and priviledges of the House of Commons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> contained in most of those paragraphs would seem to be selfexplanatory, but there are two which I should explain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was commenced in good faith and was being carried on in good faith into a matter which was relevant to our <span class="highlight">powers</span> as a part of the Federal legislature; and it was undertaken by the common consent of every political party represented in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>New concepts are continually arising in relation to the extent of our obligations, responsibilities and <span class="highlight">powers</span> and particularly the operation of the various committees of the Senate, but to my knowledge we have never come back and justified our judgments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the federal level, the States in the exercise of their sovereign <span class="highlight">powers</span>, and the hundreds of local government instrumentalities throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Having regard to the provisions of clause (ii) of section  51  of the Constitution which deals with the taxation <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth there have been occasions when people have turned their minds to a consideration of whether the decision of the Chifley Government to institute these relief areas was ultra vires the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Malta obtained a better deal from the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation <span class="highlight">powers</span> and, on top of that, gained a bonus from continental China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must examine whether the Government is whittling away the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of Parliament by reducing debating time in open public forum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The idea behind this has its origins in the early part of the Second World War when <span class="highlight">powers</span> over certain areas of taxation were referred to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw particular attention to the words ‘in the national interest’ -  that, without raising questions concerning, and without derogating from, their respective constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>, they should co-operate for the purpose of ensuring the legal effectiveness of authorities to explore for or to exploit the petroleum resources of those submerged lands: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Once the Commonwealth and the States agreed to include in the Preamble that paragraph to set aside but not to derogate from the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of either the Commonwealth or the States in this off-shore area, they created a shambles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, they created an impossible position for a draftsman seeking to draft legislation that would fit into this extraordinary position of one group of governments with almost absolute <span class="highlight">powers</span> and another government governed by a written constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of Commonwealth Parliament with respect to industrial relations are limited to a dispute extending beyond the boundaries of a State the Conciliation Commissioner could not find the existence of a dispute within these terms and therefore he was unable to settle the dispute which had been referred to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not believe that the new amendment will cure all the ills because the Commonwealth cannot legislate beyond its constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth Government has it within its <span class="highlight">powers</span> to assist this industry by quickly acceding to the request, not just of the company itself but also of a committee representing all sections of the community in Benalla, for consideration of the imposition of quantitative restrictions on cheap imports from overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Should I take it from his earlier reply to my question about replays of football programmes on Sunday mornings that, while the Government delays in introducing legislation to clarify the existing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, the Board is quite powerless to act against any programme shown by commercial licensees in that time period and that therefore commercial licensees are completely free to show any programme at all between the hours of 6 a.m. and 12 noon on Sundays? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720516_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Board sought the advice of the Attorney-General’s Department and as a result of the Department’s advice and a decision by the Government, it was decided that a full examination of the Board’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be undertaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720516_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the honourable senator is aware, the Acting Postmaster-General announced on 28th April 1972, that the Government proposes to introduce legislation to clarify the Board’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720516_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government was extremely concerned that these patients were not receiving the full measure of protection desired by the Government and was determined to take proper steps within its <span class="highlight">powers</span> to restore in New South Wales the effective protection which a majority of patients in that State had received when the common fee scheme was first brought in and which, generally speaking, patients in other States were continuing to receive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I merely record our formal opposition and indicate that this is one of the clauses on which we intended to divide and on which we want our opposition recorded on the grounds that I think have already been fairly fully canvassed, namely, that the introduction of a system of secret ballots when industrial disputes occur or are threatening will be ineffective; that it flies in the face of international experience of the fruitfulness of such provisions and flies in the face of the Donovan report in England, which fully considered this matter; that such <span class="highlight">powers</span> have been in the Act since 1928 but the Commonwealth has chosen to avail itself of those <span class="highlight">powers</span> on only 3 occasions; and that the only effect we can see of the introduction or the actual implemention of such provisions would be to exacerbate industrial relations, prolong strikes and make their settlement more difficult. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead, the Standing Committee decided that necessary dispensing <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be vested in the Registrars of Companies - or Commissioners for Corporate Affairs, where established - with statutory directions that those officers should consult with each other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That Act also provided for the appointment of an Interim Council, which was to examine the matter of the establishment of the Institute and to make recommendations with respect to the functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Institute, the constitution of its governing Council, the site of the seat of the Institute and the nature of the co-operation with the James Cook University of North Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1969 and 1970 the Government accepted the overtures of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and white collar organisations to relax penal <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, i say that many experts have condemned the use of penal <span class="highlight">powers</span> within the arbitration machinery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Excessively rising wages have been highlighted, correctly, as contributing greatly to the inflationary trend and the Government has acted, within its <span class="highlight">powers</span>, to try to alert community consciousness to the problem and to persuade wage-fixing tribunals and employers to act responsibly when confronted by excessive wage demands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s consideration of the provisions to be included in this strengthening legislation has, of course, taken account of the Commonwealth’s constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> as disclosed in the concrete pipes decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, because of some agreement, increased wages are granted and this causes increased prices of commodities, the Government can overcome the effects of any such increase granted by arbitration by means of its taxation <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My purpose, therefore, is to emphasise the Commonwealth Government’s deep interest in the problems of the environment and our determination to do what we can, within our <span class="highlight">powers</span>, to help solve those problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever way we approach this situation, if the Greek Government replies that we should not interfere in its affairs I think the Australian Government has an obligation to suggest to it that we might have to do the same as some of the NATO <span class="highlight">powers</span> have to do at times, notably in the case of the Scandinavian countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-57-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even the draconic measures - which have been taken by various American presidents, in particular by  President  Nixon just recently in relation to the agreement between the Pacific Maritime Association and the International Longshoremen’s and Warehousemen’s Union, are mild indeed compared with the draconic <span class="highlight">powers</span> possessed by the Australian Government under the industrial arbitration laws of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that insofar as some blueprint for action in Australia is to be found in what happens in the United States of America, it should be recognised that in this field the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Federal Government in the United States are vastly greater than are the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth Government in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We had the upheaval around the metal trades award towards the end of 1968 which led to the spate of strikes in 1969, in which the employers raced to the Commonwealth Industrial Court in case after case under old sections 109 and 111  -  the contempt <span class="highlight">powers</span> - ‘and automatically had fines imposed on the unions with costs added. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is the interstate trade and commerce power, the power relating to trade and commerce with other countries and, in various special areas, the legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> which provide the basis for the operation of the industrial jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not know what was contained in that reply but if it was that there was some doubt about the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Board to enforce its regulation the Government has had nearly 18 months in which to deal with the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Board sought the advice of the Attorney-General’s Department and as a result of the Department’s advice and a decision by the Government, it was decided that a full examination of the Board’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be undertaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That was  Senator Cotton  - announced on 28th April 1972, that the Government proposed to introduce legislation to clarify the Board’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What also concerns me is that I read in March 1971 that the secretaries of TCN 9 Sydney and GTV 9 Melbourne challenged the Board’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> to lay down requirements for Australian content on Australian commercial television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In regard to  Senator Douglas  McClelland’s comments in relation to football replays, the Government has announced that it will introduce legislation to clarify the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board in regard to Sunday morning programming on television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The challenge by TCN on the Australian content requirements was part of a general examination of the Board’s <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under Clause 10 of the same Agreement, the Commonwealth undertakes not to exercise any of its <span class="highlight">powers</span>, under or by virtue of an Act or Regulation, so as to discriminate against the Company, and to accord substantially equal treatment to both airlines in relation to the grant of import licences and allocation of airport facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a similar provision in Section 15 of the Airlines Equipment Act 1958 which requires the Minister, in the exercise of his <span class="highlight">powers</span> under that Act, not to discriminate in favour of either airline as against the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Institute is not limited, in the performance of  its  functions and the exercise of its <span class="highlight">powers</span>, to Australia and the territorial waters of Australia and this Act applies both within and outside Australia and extends to all the Territories of the Commonwealth not forming part of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720601_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But more particularly in Australia, where we operate under a written Constitution, where we have this great problem of the separation of State and Commonwealth <span class="highlight">powers</span>, the impact of the judiciary in determining the course of this nation has been immense and the influence of the late  Sir Owen  Dixon perhaps had no equal in the effect it had on the interpretation of the Constitution and in acquitting that Constitution to the modern Australia and to the movement of Australia into the modern world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for External Territories also remarks that, in view of the substantial <span class="highlight">powers</span> now exercised by Ministers of the House of Assembly, including those of internal finance, it is not correct to say that the Australian Government still has almost complete control of the economy of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-77-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Senator O’Byrne  said, it provides for a simple transfer of part of the Commonwealth Government’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Administration of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Evidently the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that be - possibly the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission or some official body with some say in the matter - said that there would not be the dining-room service, that there would be more passengers with fewer stewards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will recall that the Public Service Arbitration Act was amended this year to give certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> which enabled the Arbitrator to take that action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I indicated that the Public Service Arbitrator, acting under <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred upon him recently by the Public Service Arbitration Act, had made an order which required members of the Professional Radio Employees Institute of Australasia and members employed by the Overseas Telecommunications Commission to desist from conduct which would prevent the Olympic Games being televised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Board acts independently in the exercise of its statutory <span class="highlight">powers</span> and is not subject to political direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The legal position regarding the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to control Sunday morning programming is not clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Adequate constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> for such an effort are already available to the States and the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In those circumstances, and because I personally regard this as a discourteous and unnecessary misuse of the Senate’s <span class="highlight">powers</span>, I move: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They involve the Committee not only in reporting a yes or no answer to the fundamental question but in going on to say what are the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions necessary for such a commission to enable it to act speedily and efficiently against a variety of practices and abuses which may have been taking place in the securities industry in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reaction of the Minister, apart from the completely unnecessary clashes which took place, has been to bring down a new ordinance - one which is unnecessary, as  Mr Justice  Fox pointed out, because of the already existing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth, but one in which significant changes in the law were made and made in a particlar direction to which all parties represented on the Senate committee which examines regulations and ordinances have always taken exception, namely, the procedure set out in section 8c (1.) <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the fact of the matter is that we live in a pragmatic world and, whenever it -has been good enough for the Western <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the United States of America to make certain agreements with Yugoslavia and Romania as a buffer to some of the other Cominform nations, Australia has been very happy to fall in with the idea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When one is dealing with the prospective energy requirements of a nation, of which natural gas will be a important part, I do not think it is useful to divert this argument into what the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> may be because this is a subject which is fundamental to this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is this: Because of the tremendous <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the Constitution of the Senate, and because it has the total power of veto of the lower House - it has been said that the Senate is the most powerful second chamber in the world - an increase in the membership of the House of Representatives without an increase in the membership of the Senate would result in an increasing concentration of power, particularly the power of veto, in a House whose numbers were diminishing relative to those of the people’s House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is my belief that if we are to give 18-year olds  a  vote we also have to give them the right to enter into legal contracts, to buy and sell legally, and to have other <span class="highlight">powers</span> a.id responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our youth should be given all these <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude my speech by saying that when all <span class="highlight">powers</span> now given at the age of 21 years are given at 18 years I will support the right of 18 to 20 year olds to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister conduct an urgent investigation to ascertain if some of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> have been withdrawn since the return of the Government in Queensland on 27th May 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders Affairs Act 1965-67’, will give added <span class="highlight">powers</span> to an Aboriginal or Islander Council, particularly where access to reserve areas is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No <span class="highlight">powers</span> have been withdrawn since 27th May 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such a conference would require adequate preparation, should have objectives and an agenda which commanded general acceptance, and should include the live nuclearweapons <span class="highlight">powers</span> and other States of significant military and political importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> and duties of each forest service include not only the management of forest areas for the production of wood but also the management, protection and use of forests for non-wood benefits; for example, soil conservation, aesthetics, water catchments, provision of habitats for native fauna and public recreation: The use of public land comes under the scrutiny not only of the forest services but also of other government departments and bodies concerned with land use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, in our approach to it we would say that we wish to eliminate it as far as we can in the Federal sphere under constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I point out that clause 4 provides for the Act to draw upon constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> in addition to the corporations power which at present is the source of constitutional power for the existing legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition the Conference recommended that the new body should be equipped with wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> including the power compulsorily to acquire the total Australian wool clip. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Part II provides for the establishment of the Australian Wool Corporation, its principal functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span>, staff and finances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In brief, the functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the new Australian Wool Corporation will include those which are now performed by the Australian Wool Board and the Australian Wool Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed that the Corporation be given wide investigatory <span class="highlight">powers</span> in regard to wool marketing and be empowered to recommend to the Government and the Australian Wool Industry Conference any changes considered necessary in marketing arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His Excellency  for many years had so expressed himself on moral Issues that there was no doubt how he would use bis discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span>, if allowed to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As this is the first time that an Attorney-General has used his <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the recent amendments to the Companies Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must not repeat all the mistakes that were made by other countries on the pretext that private enterprise is involved and that this matter has nothing to do with the Commonwealth or that the Commonwealth has not constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A committee - even a subcommittee - of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry and Trade would be ideally situated to look at this problem and to advise quickly on the steps that should be taken by the Commonwealth so that the Commonwealth can use the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are available to it to face up to the obvious need and to look through the evidence that would be available from an investigation by the Senate Select Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that only a committee of this Senate has the necessary <span class="highlight">powers</span> to clear up these areas of doubt so that we know precisely what is being proposed before we act upon it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the <span class="highlight">powers</span> responsible in the Queensland Government decided that they would make this division greater by creating 2 Acts, the Torres Strait Islanders Act 1971 and the Aborigines Act 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only a minority exercises these <span class="highlight">powers</span> incorrectly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If all these matters came under the umbrella of a Commonwealth Minister or if the Commonwealth Minister, even with his current <span class="highlight">powers</span>, were prepared to do something about this there would be a vast amount of difference in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am asking the Treasurer too to investigate the ramification of Commonwealth <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to the Companies Acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However clause 4 provides for the Act to draw on other available constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next, there was a cloud in that the High Court had made a restrictive interpretation of the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this Parliament which had given rise to doubts as to whether effective action could be taken by the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>will permit the appointment of deputies, who will be able to attend negotiations in his stead and exercise the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the designated officer in relation to that particular set of negotiations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is satisfied that the designation of the Australian Shippers’ Council, by extending negotiations under the Act to all export trades and providing a single research and negotiating body, will substantially strengthen the collective bargaining <span class="highlight">powers</span> of shippers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In addition the Conference recommended that the new body should be equipped with wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> including the power compulsorily to acquire the total Australian wool clip. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In March of this year the Australian Wool Industry Conference submitted to the Government proposals recommending this action,  In  addition the Conference recommended that the new body should be equipped with wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> including the power  compulsorily  to acquire the total Australian wool clip. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The industry said that such a plan should involve the studying of the amalgamation of the Australian Wool Board and the Australian Wool Commission and the composition of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions of the new body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some <span class="highlight">powers</span> would need supporting legislation by the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the use when granted would still be subject to ministerial approval as would certain others; nevertheless it was considered prudent for the legislation to include at the outset all <span class="highlight">powers</span> intended for the Authority whether or not they would be exercised immediately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What  Senator McLaren  did not tell the Senate is that under its constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> the Commonwealth cannot legislate alone to grant the power of compulsory acquisition to the Australian Wool Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question arises as to whether the court would have power to make a corporation, which an Act of Parliament would seem to exempt from the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the arbitration tribunal, a named respondent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there is a paragraph (k) which gives the Corporation various <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>of section 20 of this Act, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Corporation include the power- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bland Committee’s terms of reference require that it should determine whether some review should be provided in respect of administrative decisions taken under discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred by legislation in the administration of the Department of Social Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In order to remove any doubts that may exist regarding TAA’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> to implement the Government’s decisions, certain changes in the Australian National Airlines Act may be desirable, but the limited time available has precluded the drawing up of the necessary amending legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the intention of this Government, therefore, to introduce in the first sittings of the new Parliament a Bill amending the Act so that there is no question about TAA having the <span class="highlight">powers</span> enabling it to engage in activities closely related to airline operation and to give effect to the Government’s decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ancillary provisions, such as the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of a collector to enforce payment of the levy, are also similar to the relevant provisions in respect of light dues.I commend the Bill to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The document relates to <span class="highlight">powers</span> over and protection offered to witnesses who appear before parliamentary committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is entitled ‘<span class="highlight">Powers</span> Over and Protection Offered to Witnesses Before Parliamentary Committees’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To this clause I shall be moving the last amendment which has been circulated in my name and which deals with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">powers</span> are set out in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) of the clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> are comprehensive, but they do not authorise the Corporation to operate, if required, as an authority handling the acquisition of the Australian wool clip. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot seem to place it in its proper context in this category because this clause deals with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Corporation, lt seems to us that it is more intended - this is particularly so from what  Senator Wilkinson  said - to be a matter of inquiry rather than of actual operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the subclause with which we have just dealt, lt is suggested now that we place amongst the Corporation’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> an added power that does not appear in  thi  Bill at the moment to make arrangements for the operation of an approved marketing scheme to acquire and/or market the Australian wool clip. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the Corporation is granted in clause 40 of this proposed Act of Parliament are very wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> to do almost anything in the interests of the objectives that have already been granted to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They include the power to buy wool, to sell wool, to lease or purchase the property, to employ labour, to demolish or remove buildings and many other <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 40 deals with the specific <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Specific <span class="highlight">powers</span> of Corporation in relation to wool marketing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the <span class="highlight">powers</span> we see, as I said in introducing my amendment, that there are these ones to inspect and appraise wool, to buy wool at auction or otherwise, to sell wool the property of the Corporation and other <span class="highlight">powers</span> included in subclauses (a) to (g). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the Corporation is being given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Little  says, under clause 38(l.)(o) the Corporation has all sorts of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to investigate, and make recommendations in regard to other matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the Bill to prevent foreign take-overs that are against the national interest will be exercisable by the Government, acting through the Minister administering the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In exercising these <span class="highlight">powers</span>, however, the Government will in practice act on advice from the departmental officials I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate can be assured that the Government will not hesitate to use its <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the full to ensure compliance with the controls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Two main <span class="highlight">powers</span> are provided in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister is satisfied that having regard to all the circumstances an acquisition would not give a significant degree of foreign control over the conduct of the company in question, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Bill will not apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In exercising these <span class="highlight">powers</span>, however, the Court will be required to satisfy itself, as far as it reasonably can do so, that any order it proposes to make will not unfairly prejudice any person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Court’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> are limited where the breach in question was due to inadvertence and excusable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has, however, decided that the investment <span class="highlight">powers</span> relating to this fund and the superannuation fund should be widened so that up to 25 per cent of each fund can be invested in shares, debentures, real property, and in loans to building societies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know, because it will not enable them  to  go  on to  the appellant jurisdiction in relation  to  these matters in any other superior court where they would  be  able to draw on the experience that they have gained in exercising these new <span class="highlight">powers</span> ;n these new jurisdictions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I took the reply of the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  to mean that he did not know the position but that he thought we had the power under the social service <span class="highlight">powers</span> in placitum 51  (XXi iA)  of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that the answer I received and the common wording of the social service <span class="highlight">powers</span> outlined in the Constitution leave beyond doubt that there is no substance in that claim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That, or perhaps another agency with similar but somewhat widened <span class="highlight">powers</span>, could set out vigorously to mobilise money, to endeavour to exploit our resources in the interests of our own people and to secure into Australia’s hands those resources, industries and parts of commerce which already have gone into the hands of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In order to remove any doubts that may exist regarding TAA’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> to implement the Government’s decisions, certain changes in the Australian National Airlines Act may be desirable, but the limited time available has precluded the drawing up of the necessary amending legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is stated in the Constitution that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate shall be the same as the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the House of Representatives but the limitations, in the nature of things, of a second House, are quite severe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to clause 13 (1) (a) of the Bill where the functions, duties and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Authority are stated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to Part III of the Bill, which concerns the functions, duties and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to its control, use and development of Australian resources, of course, it is simply a means of providing transportation, together with whatever be the ambit of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of purchase and sale which is to be conferred at some future time as the Authority requires or determines itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A central Authority in the field, given the requisite <span class="highlight">powers</span>, could be assured of having all relevant up to date information, because it could act as a central bruin for the storage and evaluating of all the data emanating from these public and private areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is suggesting that the Authority should be established, as the Bill proposes, and that the Authority should have all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> necessary to make the researchers, to examine the feasibility of various pipeline constructions and then to present to the Parliament a comprehensive report indicating the benefits and the cost of the proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A referendum to give the Commonwealth Parliament complete <span class="highlight">powers</span> to make laws with respect to all forms of transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it appears to the Opposition that the fact that we have such statutory arrangements and policies in relation to coal in existence means that coal should be excluded from the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the proposed Authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> that may be exercised or may possibly be exercised by that Authority in relation to coal could well cut across existing statutory provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That clause provides, under the heading ‘Part 111 - Functions, Duties and <span class="highlight">Powers</span> of the Authority’: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is simple and has the clear and definite purpose to set up an Authority with adequate <span class="highlight">powers</span> to construct  and  operate a major public utility having the responsibility of making one  of  our greatest natural resources available to the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Authority may perform its functions to the extent that they are not in excess of the functions that may be conferred on the Authority by virtue of any of the legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth, including the power of the Parliament to make laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that this amendment will not give any great supervisory <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the suggested <span class="highlight">powers</span> may be an embarrassment to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The central aim of my Government’s foreign policy will be to do all we can as a medium- sized power to help all nations including the great <span class="highlight">powers</span> and not least our great ally, to make the most of the new opportunities now presenting themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We plan to develop a substantial relationship with China, based on friendship, cooperation and mutual trust, comparable with that which we have, or seek, with other major <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was therefore only logical that we should from an early stage have examined the possibilities of bringing into existence the kind of regional community which, as I said in my speech to the Summer School of the Australian Institute of Political Science on 26 January, would be ‘an organisation genuinely representative of the region, without ideological overtones, conceived as an initiative to help free the region of Great Power rivalries that have bedevilled its progress for decades and designed te insulate the region against ideological interference from the Great <span class="highlight">Powers</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not assumed and endorsed these commitments uncritically but are submitting them all to close scrutiny to determine their usefulness and appropriateness in an age which bears witness to growing ideological co-existence and strategic interdependence between the great and small <span class="highlight">powers</span> alike. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We intend to base our relations with Japan on our desire for wholehearted co-operation in promoting the common interests of our 2 countries and of the region in which we are two of the wealthiest <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 16 deals with the particular <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similar <span class="highlight">powers</span> are held by other statutory authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I pointed out in speaking to another clause last night, this Authority is being clothed with wide and great <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wc must consider that right in the light of the fact that the Authority is to be clothed with wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> to protect it and indeed to help it to enter into what could become a very commercial enterprise and one which, at some time, could even enter into very keen competition in other forms of activity of which we may not be aware at this stage of the development of technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be spelled out more precisely,’ not less, and the obligations of being a public utility conducted in the broad sense ki the public good, when one has regard to the huge amount of capital involved, ought to be precisely spelled out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clause sets out very clearly enormous <span class="highlight">powers</span> for the Authority which are absolutely necessary when we consider the magnitude of the task with which it is faced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Authority must have great <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the broad <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are outlined in the Bill there may be an offence against civil rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear enough that the Authority, under the <span class="highlight">powers</span> given in this clause, could demolish a dwelling house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Authority is given terrific <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same <span class="highlight">powers</span> are provided under the Act to which I was referring earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To those of the Left or the Right who preach in Australia the doctrine of violence, I have only this to say: I shall use unremittingly and support without qualification my colleagues who join me in using the Constitutional and Institutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> invested in my Government to end political violence in Australia.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already a request -has ‘ been received from one State’ for the Commonwealth Government to take over certain State <span class="highlight">powers</span> concerning Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He prefaced his question by drawing my attention - quite properly - to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that reside with the Presiding Officers to deal with certain matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Standing Orders, from practice and from the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that reside in the Presiding Officers to maintain the proper functioning of Parliament and its precincts, including matters of security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It makes the whole Prices Justification Tribunal, in my opinion, something of a joke, if the Government cannot see the wisdom in the suggestion that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Tribunal must be confined and that copies of books or books of original entry or secretarial notes, or whatever they might ‘ be, must be returned to a company upon its written request or some such notification.. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are to have a Federal parliamentary committee on prices under the chairmanship of  Mr Hurford,  the member for Adelaide, a committee which, on  Mr Hurford’s  own admission, will possess no statutory <span class="highlight">powers</span> but which, as he says hopefully, will operate  by intimidating the particular business interests marked out for attention under a threat of a Government sponsored consumer boycott of the goods in question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It conforms with a variety of quite unqualified statements made by the Australian Labor Party last year when in Opposition that, given a mandate to govern, the Labor Party would put an end to inflation and would do so within the <span class="highlight">powers</span> available to the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have repeated that claim because I think that the Parliament and the people of Australia are going to see in the months ahead a series of alibis and I predict that there will be a seeking of <span class="highlight">powers</span> of reference under the Constitution because of the failure of price control programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One might give to the Tribunal <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be able to say of a particular commodity: ‘We have investigated this commodity and, for the time being, you have the franchise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government proposes to give to this Tribunal <span class="highlight">powers</span> that no Parliament in the land should give. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 19 enables the  Chairman  to create divisions within the Commission, which will exercise the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission for the purpose of conducting inquiries and reporting on applications from States and local governing regional organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the intention of this Government, therefore, to introduce in the first sittings of the new Parliament, a Bill amending the Australian National Airlines Act so that there is no question about TransAustralia Airlines having the <span class="highlight">powers</span> enabling it to engage in activities closely related to airline operation and to give effect to the Government’s decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment of the Australian National Airlines Act to widen Trans-Australia Airlines <span class="highlight">powers</span> is one matter concerning which this Government is in complete agreement with the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It therefore has no hesitation in bringing foward this Bill, which is designed to give TAA the additional <span class="highlight">powers</span> mentioned so that it will be in a fair and equitable position compared with Ansett Transport Industries Ltd in respect of its operations under the two-airline policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, it provides for the other activities on which there is agreement that TAA should have full <span class="highlight">powers</span>, namely: (a) aerial work operations; (b) the operation of hotels and other forms of accommodation; (c) joint operations with other carriers; (d) air transport operations in Papua New Guinea, after that country becomes independent, under arrangements which are agreed between the Commonwealth and the Government of that country; and (e) engineering services for outside organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clause also restates the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission to engage in activities incidental to its basic functions and in particular authorises it to participate in a company or partnership for the purposes of carrying out those functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly the Commonwealth does have sovereignty in these areas under its constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> relating to foreign affairs and defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously the Commonwealth is the only authority which can negotiate with foreign <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to these areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also has <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to defence over the area of the territorial seas and the seabed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People who claim that the Bill must be dealt with because of its urgent national importance completely overlook the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the Commonwealth Government clearly has in regard to this area and which never should have been put in doubt by anyone when discussing this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator James  McClelland who no doubt, in opposition to the 3 Premiers from the 3 Labor States, will carry the day - according to his estimation of his own <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is argued now that, because they ceded <span class="highlight">powers</span> that they conjointly and separately recognised should necessarily be held by the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth is in a position of power to extract from the States further concessions because commercial possibility are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt in the minds of any of the State Premiers about where the responsibilities and <span class="highlight">powers</span> lie at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only the Commonwealth which says that there, is a case that should be argued before the High Court and that because certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> have already been ceded to the Commonwealth it should have still more <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this issue the Premier of every State has interpreted the votes which were given to his party and which enabled him to form a government to mean that the people want that government to retain the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which have always been considered since Federation to reside with the States and which, without question or doubt, resided in the hands of the States before Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But should it go to the High Court when there is such complete unanimity among the States that this power resides properly in them, has done so since the beginning of Australia as we know it today, has never resided in the Commonwealth in any shape or form and that the Commonwealth has exceeded its <span class="highlight">powers</span> by endeavouring to legislate in the Commonwealth Parliament for the Commonwealth to have power which the States say that it does not have? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not want to see arbitrary, unilateral action taken to deprive them of a lot of their <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the continental shelf is the product of an exercise by the Australian national Government of its constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> in respect of external affairs, and it seems to me to be impossible to deny that this Parliament has power to legislate for what may be found - whether petroleum or minerals - within that continental shelf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only thing is that the States’ authority in that respect would always be subject to the overriding authority of the Commonwealth, if the 2 governments make laws within the authority of their own constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Press would only look at the thing in perspective it would see that this Bill does not threaten the fundamental constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that Committee, a most able Committee representative of all sections of the Senate, found that that type of legislation denies true ministerial responsibility and excludes from the Constitution the proper resolution of constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> by the High Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Snowy Mountains Authority had overriding <span class="highlight">powers</span> during its operations and it too was not an elected body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One that comes to mind is the Tennessee Valley Authority which apparently had overriding <span class="highlight">powers</span> to construct works and to do all things necessary to carry out the concept of a regional development authority or a Cities Commission, as is the title of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know how much the authority would override a State government’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> but I think that everybody would concede that for a big investment of this nature to develop an area wherever it might be in Australia - AlburyWodonga is the only one mentioned so far - there must be a very powerful authority which can take the steps necessary to achieve the development, to decide which industries will go where, which will be financed and what usage will be made of the lands surrounding the district. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think he was implying that the Commonwealth was bound under the Constitution to pay ruling rates for the land whereas under State laws, or in some States at any rate, since States have sovereign <span class="highlight">powers</span> they can resume land for certain purposes without having to pay the full amount for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission will be almost unlimited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There could be many reasons for this, some of them perhaps beyond the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of individuals, local councils, State governments or even Federal governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>insofar as those matters relate to any matter with respect to which the Parliament has <span class="highlight">powers</span> to make laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Section 88 empowers the Governor-General, where an Act, regulation, etc., confers <span class="highlight">powers</span> and duties on the holder of an office, to direct an officer to exercise or perform those <span class="highlight">powers</span> or duties during the vacancy in the office or when the office-holder is absent or unavailable to perform the duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, where these duties comprise the exercise of statutory <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions under other Acts, etc., these cannot be performed and exercised unless there is also a direction by the Governor-General under section 88. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment to section 88 will enable an officer who is performing the duties of an office in a department pursuant to a direction under regulation 116 to exercise and perform also the statutory <span class="highlight">powers</span> and duties which attach to the office without the necessity for action by the Governor-General under the section. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Opportunity has also been taken to replace the clause concerning the borrowing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Corporation by a new clause conforming with the latest Government policies in this area and identical with the standard provisions in other similar Acts such as the Overseas Telecommunications Act 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite clear that the Commonwealth Parliament, in the exercise of its constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>, enacted the Telephonic Communications (Interception) Act which was intended to cover and to state exhaustively the circumstances in which telephones could be tapped - to use the popular expression - by authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill provides for the election of 2 senators each for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory and that such senators have the same <span class="highlight">powers</span>, immunities and privileges as senators representing the States; that the first election of Territory senators be held at the same time as the next Senate elections in the several States or at the same time as the next general elections for members of the House of Representatives, if such is held before or in conjunction with the next Senate elections; that the term of the first Territory senators be from the date of their election until the eve of polling day for the ensuing general election for members of the House of Representatives; that after the first election for Territory senators, elections be held at the same time as the general elections for members of the House of Representatives; that after the first election of Territory senators, the terms of Territory senators be the period between each House of Representatives election; and for the Territory senators to be elected under the same system of proportional representation as that currently applicable to the election of senators representing the States, except in the case of a single casual vacancy when such vacancy shall be filled by the holding of a by-election adopting the procedures used for filling a single casual vacancy for a State senator, as far as may be applicable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not blaming the Minister for that, but it would seem that the Bill as originally presented in the House of Representatives, gave <span class="highlight">powers</span> to Trans-Australia Airlines far beyond those envisaged by the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trans-Australia Airlines pointed out that one of the objectives of the 1957 agreement was to secure a position in which there were 2 operators of trunk route airline services, each capable of effective competition with the other and that effective competition was not possible because of the smaller size and restricted <span class="highlight">powers</span> of TAA. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the intention of this Government, therefore, to introduce in the first sittings of the new Parliament, a Bill amending the Australian National Airlines Act so that there is no question about TransAustralia Airlines having the <span class="highlight">powers</span> enabling it  to  engage in activities closely related to airline operation and togive effect to the Government’s decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>‘In fact, the previous Bill gave TAA enormous <span class="highlight">powers</span> to acquire almost anything. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, I hope that this Bill is pushed through and that TAA is given the <span class="highlight">powers</span> it wants, because I believe that by so doing we will create the competition about which I spoke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Bill the Commission will have new <span class="highlight">powers</span>, and I think I should restate them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs: When the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee is finally established what <span class="highlight">powers</span>, if any, will this body have in relation to legislation affecting Aborigines? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While, as a result of the referendum it is thought that the Commonwealth has complete <span class="highlight">powers</span> over Aboriginal affairs, the Commonwealth has not exercised full <span class="highlight">powers</span> and is in consultation with the States about their handing over of their <span class="highlight">powers</span> as the Commonwealth does not desire to act contrary to agreement with the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It had no time to lose, otherwise its <span class="highlight">powers</span> would diminish and be progressively handed over to other bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, we would want to extend the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of local government being, as it is, much closer to the people and much more responsive to their needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, as one would know, the Government’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> may have certain limitations; it may be that those limitations are less in cases such as this than in a normal case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator would be aware that mostly the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this Parliament are constrained by, say, the corporation <span class="highlight">powers</span> and a few others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are very wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the corporation to act in its own discretion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All J can say in answer to the honourable senator’s question is that the statutory corporation seems to have extremely wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> and to be independent largely of any kind of ministerial control or direction and therefore free to that extent of parliamentary control in the sense that the Minister is responsible to Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should not have to stress that in the Parliament we should always be concerned as to how Parliament exercises its traditional and unchallenged <span class="highlight">powers</span> when those <span class="highlight">powers</span> impinge upon the vocations and the accepted rights and freedoms of citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I am sure I am not misunderstood when I refer to Parliament’s traditional <span class="highlight">powers</span> with the enormous impact with which they operate and the area over which they operate, and I say that this obligation has a direct and particular significance to us all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The power and privileges of the Senate as one House of the Parliament deriving immense inherent <span class="highlight">powers</span> from the House of Commons and the unexaminable authority with which our Constitution clothes those <span class="highlight">powers</span> must be exercised with responsibility and restraint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are <span class="highlight">powers</span> too easily used - and misused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is entirely proper that the Presiding Officers of the Houses of Parliament should have wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> to ensure the proper functioning of their Houses and the regulation of Parliament’s precincts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is a question of importance as to whether the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the  President  and the  Speaker  should be as wide as they have been and as capable of unchallengeable exercise as they have been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker Cameron in 1951 indicated the ramifications of the exercise of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the width of the discretion power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For many years the last Government was subservient to the great <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And why does not this Government on the next suitable occasion seek Federal <span class="highlight">powers</span> to control prices in this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the allied <span class="highlight">powers</span> had joined forces in those days it is likely that the horrible 1939-45 war could have been avoided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nothing could convince the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that be in Canberra - some of the gentlemen who sit up in ivory towers and who have no knowledge of the practicality of the position - that damage was being done to the Australian industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It also gives the university specific <span class="highlight">powers</span>: To appoint its own traffic officers; to regulate access to the university roads; to set up parking meters and charge for parking; to tow away abandoned vehicles; to prescribe fines for traffic offences proved in court; and where parking or stopping offences are involved, to fix a small penalty which the offenders may choose to pay rather than undergo prosecution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Webster  also asked me to obligate the Government in respect of the present <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Legislative Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, that is a difficult undertaking to give but in view of the tenor and the spirit of the amendment I think it is extremely unlikely that any <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Council will be reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Similarly Prime Minister Chifley set the tone for replies to questions concerning proper controls over ASIO and its activities, and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Director-General of Security, later the same year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said it had no enforcement <span class="highlight">powers</span> such as a police force had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He said that it had no executive <span class="highlight">powers</span>, nor could it take action in the administrative field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr McMahon  said that its <span class="highlight">powers</span> were designed to enable it to collect intelligence and, as the DirectorGeneral of Security thought fit, to advise Ministers, heads of departments and others whom he felt should be informed in the interests of the security of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the decision made last week at the Constitutional Convention whereby, I gather, the Australian Government proposes to hold a referendum aimed at amending the Australian Constitution to enable <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be referred by this Parliament to State Parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Australian Government considered what <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this Parliament should be referred to State Parliaments, and if so, which <span class="highlight">powers</span> does it have in mind? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are two, and in general it might be said that it was those <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are now within the exclusive province of the Australian <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> is a question to be agreed upon between the Commonwealth and the State government concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was under the impression that as from 1 July this year the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the South Australian Government over Aborigines were transferred to the federal sphere but I cannot be definite about that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand the Statute of Westminster has not enlarged the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth to the detriment of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To a minor degree, this situation is similar in countries with formerly were dominated by colonial <span class="highlight">Powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the tragedies is that so many of our financial institutions seem to be outside the clear <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealthsuch as the fringe banking institutionsthat monetary measures are not able to be taken as well as they ought to be in a properly regulated economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one of the reasons why, central to the considerations of the Constitutional Review Committee last week was the problem of enabling the national Parliament and Government to have adequate <span class="highlight">powers</span> to manage the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seemed to be pretty well accepted that the national Parliament and Government ought to have those <span class="highlight">powers</span> which, at the moment, they do not have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> should reside in the Australian Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because  Mr Whitlam  had said: ‘You know, the States have <span class="highlight">powers</span> but we are powerless in this area’,  Mr Snedden  came forward and stated: ‘The Liberal leaders of the States are willing to come together in cooperation and to give you temporary <span class="highlight">powers</span> to get on with the job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, if you want the <span class="highlight">powers</span>, whistle up the leaders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will introduce mirror legislation and by cooperation give you those <span class="highlight">powers</span> temporarily’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let it be made perfectly clear that the continuation and, indeed, the aggravation of inflation in Australia are directly due to the wilful refusal of the Prime Minister and his Cabinet first to seek, through a national conference, co-operation and restraint and, secondly, if necessary, to seek what is offered by the Liberal governments and Liberal leaders, that is, Federal-State co-operation in the temporary transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it can be shown that what the Government seeks are sensible <span class="highlight">powers</span> all the Commonwealth Government has to do is to call the State leaders together and invite them by cooperative action to refer the necessary <span class="highlight">powers</span> temporarily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter what the bleatings from the Opposition might be, when it came to the question of nuclear explosions, as  Senator Murphy  pointed out, we have been critical of any of the super <span class="highlight">powers</span> which have indulged in this nuclear madness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator will be aware that in pursuance of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which were vested in me as the Minister for Customs and Excise to consent to the export of kangaroo skins- the policy had been that although export should be prohibited the Minister could consent to waive that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the duty of the Board, within the limits of its <span class="highlight">powers</span>, to ensure that the monetary and banking policy of the Bank is directed to the greatest advantage of the people of Australia and that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Bank under this Act, the Banking Act 1959 and the regulations under that Act are exercised in such a manner as, in the opinion of the Board, will best contribute to the stability of the currency of Australia; the maintenance of full employment in Australia; and the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The trouble is that they are faced with the problem that they are a part of a world in which the great <span class="highlight">powers</span> which have the bomb are determined to retain it but refuse to guarantee the defence or protection of other countries which do not have the bomb should they be attacked by a country which has the bomb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We of the Australian Democratic Labor Party, like the  President  of India,  Mrs Ghandi,  and the rulers of other countries, believe that everything possible should be done to achieve world nuclear disarmament, but in the event of certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> refusing to guarantee the protection of countries which are not nuclear armed, we believe that Australia should seek, preferably from her allies, guarantees of protection which include, if necessary, the provision of the bomb as a deterrent for our own country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point that has to be taken into consideration is that although the indignation has been focused upon them the French are not actually proposing to arm themselves with nuclear weapons to anything like the degree that the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> have nuclear armed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether we agree with it or not, we have to concede at least that in the present balance of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> in Europe under which no country could stand up to the Soviet Union the French have an argument which ought to be looked at. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next thing I want to point out- Professor Burns mentioned it- is that the French propose to obtain nuclear armaments to an infinitely lower degree than the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> which already possess them and in regard to which there appears to be no criticism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The French have gone much further in setting up precautions against possible dangers than the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> which, as I have pointed out, are not being criticised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All we can say about the French is that so far as their bombs or their armaments are concerned, they are proposed to be infinitely less than those of the other major <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The French say that they are developing nuclear weapons only because the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> refuse to guarantee protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mrs Ghandi,  the Prime Minister of India, has stated that there is no argument against a nation seeking nuclear arms when major <span class="highlight">powers</span> will not protect her. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commenced with the assertion that if we can confine the argument to the super <span class="highlight">powers</span> that have nuclear weapons we reduce the danger of nuclear wars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My greatest fear is that when France or one of the middle <span class="highlight">powers</span> almost achieves parity as far as nuclear weapons are concerned it should sublet them to lesser <span class="highlight">powers</span>; I have in mind particularly the Middle East. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that there were a number of middle <span class="highlight">powers</span>- I think that Italy came into this category- who were not so strong in their views about the military limitations of nuclear power but who had some fears that their industrial expansion would be curbed if they did not share in nuclear knowhow, I think it was a complete distortion by  Senator McManus  to link nations which had a rightful concern about the limitation of their commercial expansion with other nations that took a different attitude on the military aspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gives the people the chance to say that they believe the Australian Parliament should have reasonable <span class="highlight">powers</span> to ensure the best possible economic management of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recognise, for example, that the effectiveness of the Prices Justification Tribunal pardy depends upon its persuasive <span class="highlight">powers</span>, working through informed public opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we intend to do, in addition to all the things we have done in 9 months- we have shown more initiative in 9 months than the previous Government did in 23 years- is go to the final masters, the final judges in all of these things- the Australian people- to ask them to give us authority to write permanently into the Constitution of Australia the <span class="highlight">powers</span> for this Government and future governments to deal with the whole question of prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can only applaud the wisdom of the men who drew up the Constitution for their action in giving this House of Parliament concurrent <span class="highlight">powers</span> with the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can hardly say that the Government is fair dinkum when the Prime Minister admits that this particular measure is not likely to be effective and when he admits that he has reservations about the value of price control <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The conference should develop a course of cooperative action which would call upon the Commonwealth and the States to use their governmental and legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> to tackle the problem of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a measure designed to give the Parliament of this country <span class="highlight">powers</span> which almost every other national parliament of a comparable country has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what is obvious is that the States have had enough of this Government’s usurping of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore they will fight any move to give the central Government further constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has happened in respect of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the State governments since this Government came to office? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Up until 1 949 the Commonwealth Government, under its defence <span class="highlight">powers</span>, had control of prices in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I must say- I think  Senator Poyser  will in all fairness allow me to say- that by using almost dictatorial <span class="highlight">powers</span> he refused to accept the umpire’s verdict- the decision of the Commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have reached it, as the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and  Senator Murphy  have pointed out, because in the consultations with the States they have indicated a resistance to the handing over of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Except for the Labor States, my own State in particular, there is a resistance to the handing over of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is extraordinary that in this world today- 1 973- other countries have great and sophisticated <span class="highlight">powers</span> over these things, but Australia does not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could use the corporation <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Opposition says that it will not allow the people to answer the question, we say that we would like to use the corporation <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are saying that it is evident that we need to go one step further and ask the people of Australia what <span class="highlight">powers</span> they think the Government should have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have first to ask the people of Australia what <span class="highlight">powers</span> they think the Government should have, if we win their support, which I believe we will receive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, when governments in Great Britain, New Zealand and the United States of America have these <span class="highlight">powers</span>, we see no reason why they should not be given to the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is surprised by the action of the Oppositionapart from the Australian Democratic Labor Patry- in directly opposing the giving of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Federal Government and in not permitting the people to decide whether the Federal Government should have <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is evident that the people ought to be allowed to have their say as to whether Parliament should have <span class="highlight">powers</span> to pass whatever legislation is thought fit on that subject in an endeavour to curb inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that this is a gigantic confidence trick in order to secure from the people centralist <span class="highlight">powers</span> for other purposes, particularly for the Marxist type doctrines on socialism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is using the false argument that the Commonwealth needs the <span class="highlight">powers</span> in order to control prices and therefore to control inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those lesser populated States, in particular, are very careful not to give to the Commonwealth Parliament <span class="highlight">powers</span> which they believe may not act in their interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People are very much concerned about inflation, but they are being hoodwinked into believing that the cure for inflation is to give the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">powers</span> over prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the previous Government was able to build up the economic future of this nation tremendously with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that already exist by using strong and responsible monetary policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have said that they will give the Federal Government the necessary <span class="highlight">powers</span> for a period in order to control inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are able to control inflation without wasing money on a referendum, by taking up the offer of the Premiers and taking the <span class="highlight">powers</span> temporarily - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He probably has not told the Minister, but every State Premier has agreed to join with the Commonwealth in producing a plan to combat inflation and, if necessary, to hand over temporarily to the Commonwealth those <span class="highlight">powers</span> necessary to make operative any plan that is drawn up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a smokescreen, an endeavour to secure for this socialist Government <span class="highlight">powers</span> to bring about its socialist program for the control of the means of production, distribution and exchange. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were prepared in the short term to refer <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Federal Government so that a whole economic and fiscal policy could be adopted that might be of assistance in reducing the spiral of inflation which is of concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The German  Ifo  economic research institute recently counted a dozen European countries which imposed statutory price freezes or controls during 1970-71; most of the rest, including Britain, have also introduced prices policies, but not with mandatory <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It said that under the corporation <span class="highlight">powers</span> it was not necessary to conduct a referendum of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I look at the honourable senator, who comes from Queensland, and I lose my confidence in the thinking <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the people of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We stand for the principle that Government elected by the people of this country should be given the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that arenecessary to arm itself to act in the interests of thepeople. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cast my mind back to 1 944 and to what was known then as the ‘<span class="highlight">Powers</span> Bill ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Chifley  had been exercising price control under his wartime <span class="highlight">powers</span> and before those <span class="highlight">powers</span> had lapsed he brought down a referendum aimed at reposing price control <span class="highlight">powers</span> within the ambit of the Commonwealth government for all time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Predicting longer strikes and total stoppages,  Mr Mundey  says that tactics in strikes, particularly since 1949, have been so tailored as to give a high priority to the penal <span class="highlight">powers</span> threat and thus the need to ‘get them back to work’ to avoid fines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the removal of some of the teeth from the penal <span class="highlight">powers</span> in May 1969, longer strikes including general strikes are likely to become the order of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the offers which have been made by those States which are led by Liberal and Country Party governments to cede certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> temporarily to the Commonwealth Government- I understand that the Labor governed States have also expressed their preparedness to co-operate with the Commonwealth Government- provided an incomes and prices control policy is adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see in the Government’s attitudes the increasing movement towards attracting to itself greater <span class="highlight">powers</span> based here on Canberra, this centralist policy of the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government of those days did not need additional <span class="highlight">powers</span> to carry out the plan of holding inflation within bounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if the Bill is agreed to and a referendum is held, what does the Government propose to do with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that might accrue to it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it wants to persuade me and other Opposition honourable senators that it wants more power, I want to know, and in some detail, how those <span class="highlight">powers</span> will be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What it seeks to do is to add to section 5 1 of the Constitution which sets out the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth Parliament, a new paragraph ( XiVA.) <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The McMahon Government and its predecessors have always been pleased to say that the Australian Government has no such <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hence the easiest course is to lead people to believe that there are no <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dr Cairns, a senior member of the Australian Labor Party, said to the people of Australia: ‘We do not need any more <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will not be seeking any centralisation of <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are ample <span class="highlight">powers</span> to control inflation. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask honourable senators to bear in mind that one of the great arguments of the election campaign was the centralisation or abuse of <span class="highlight">powers</span> or the decentralisation of <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the first responsibility of the national Parliament fully to test and apply these <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So what  Dr Cairns  said on behalf of his Party was that it would use the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which it believed existed in the Constitution and that it would test those <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But even if this constitutional power was not there, the national Government has full and adequate <span class="highlight">powers</span> of other kinds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many times  Mr Whitlam  referred to the fact that the Government had <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did not say: ‘We have not the <span class="highlight">powers</span> at all.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It went to the people not only seeking no mandate but also saying specifically: ‘We will not need any further centralised <span class="highlight">powers</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For it now to go seeking further centralised <span class="highlight">powers</span> is to reject the whole thesis of its argument on inflation in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, quite apart from the fact that  Mr Whitlam, Dr Cairns  and others have said that they could do these things without further <span class="highlight">powers</span> and that the Labor Party went to the people saying: ‘Put us in and inflation and industrial unrest will subside’, I put this to honourable senators: We are now being put in a ludicrous situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Never let the people of Australia forget that the problem of inflation which now exists has been created by the Labor Party’s misuse of centralised <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We got into a mess because of our abuse of the centralised <span class="highlight">powers</span> that we now have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For Lord ‘s sake help us out of this mess by giving us more centralised <span class="highlight">powers</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does anyone really believe that the people of Australia will willingly give more <span class="highlight">powers</span> to a government when the mess that it is in has been created by its abuse of existing <span class="highlight">powers</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have this incredible proposition that a Government which has created inflation and which has aggravated inflation and has done so by the most gross abuse of its <span class="highlight">powers</span>, says to the people: ‘We want you to give us more <span class="highlight">powers</span> to abuse’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very timely when we are debating a subject matter of great importance regarding the vesting of <span class="highlight">powers</span> in Parliament that we remind ourselves that the whole business of democratic government is the business of the vesting of <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are left with the outrageous proposition that not only did the Prime Minister yesterday or the day before seek to get the twinning of <span class="highlight">powers</span> over prices and income but so did the Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  the man fundamentally interested in this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we have had a statement from the Minister for Defence  (Mr Barnard)  that the reason for dismantling our defence forces is that the global situation is stabilising and that there is detente among the major <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the State governments have indicated as clearly and as unequivocally as words can convey that they stand prepared to support by complementary legislation or, if need be, by reference of <span class="highlight">powers</span>, any plain, considered and comprehensive policy to cope with the inflationary problems which the Commonwealth Government puts up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fortunately history and the law reports are replete with instances of how the prices-control legislation of the wartime years and those miserable years immediately after the war until the Labor Party Government was displaced, exercised the power to control prices which it had taken under the aegis of the defence <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words,  Sir Roland  Wilson is putting a warning to the people of Australia against giving centralised <span class="highlight">powers</span> permanently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that the Labor Party said during the election was that it needed no more <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sixth reason for saying that the Bill should be rejected as a means of control is because the whole of history indicates that <span class="highlight">powers</span> sought by referendum will be rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, to put to the people at this moment a proposition that the solution to their major problem- inflationlies in centralisation of <span class="highlight">powers</span>, is improper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The seventh reason is that the Prime Minister has made it clear that he did not want these <span class="highlight">powers</span> and that he did not think they would be useful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only warn that, as throughout history, the people of Australia very rightly will vote against the centralisation of <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They certainly will do so now as a result of this open-ended request for <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I warn that if we, as a Parliament, rest on the assumption that the seeking and obtaining of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> will solve our problems, Australia will be brought in the new year to a chronic state of inflation which, with the shrinking of growth for a variety of reasons by the middle of next year in my view will reach a state of chronic stagflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me make it quite clear that I certainly would not agree to giving any further <span class="highlight">powers</span> to a Government such as this which has shown itself to be incompetent in managing the economy and to a Prime Minister who has shown quite clearly his inability to understand economics or even to lead his Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This mad gallop by the Government towards centralising all <span class="highlight">powers</span> has to be stopped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if this Bill passes the Senate the people of Australia will indicate clearly that they are not prepared to give any further <span class="highlight">powers</span> to a government such as we have today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He proposed that the Prime Minister- he offered to lend his goodwill to this proposal- should meet with the State Premiers to seek their co-operation in having their <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to prices referred to the Commonwealth for a limited period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recognise that the problem today is so great that immediate action is required, and the immediate action required is the calling of a conference with the State Premiers to seek a referral of their <span class="highlight">powers</span> on prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they agree to this proposal and if the Prime Minister is less arrogant and less dominating, providing certain conditions are met and certain undertakings are given, I have no doubt that these <span class="highlight">powers</span> will be referred to the Commonwealth for a limited period so that the Commonwealth can act immediately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such immediate action can be obtained by the Premiers agreeing to refer their <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But he was then asked by the Leader of the Opposition whether he would accept the offer if the States were prepared to refer <span class="highlight">powers</span> for a limited period so that the Commonwealth could legislate on prices and incomes, and  Mr Whitlam  replied- and this is obviously on off-the-cuff comment, which is even more extraordinary for a Prime Minister- as reported at page 1 128 of the House of Representatives Hansard: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will certainly accept on behalf of the Government any reference of <span class="highlight">powers</span> by the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be precise, I would accept a reference of <span class="highlight">powers</span> over prices and incomes or prices alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitudes he himself has struck this month over prices <span class="highlight">powers</span>, incomes <span class="highlight">powers</span> and a prices and incomes policy have been variously devious, wavering or obscure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he has this he will achieve these <span class="highlight">powers</span> not in 4 or 5 months time but very much sooner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We oppose it because we believe that the people of Australia do not want the Senate to give <span class="highlight">powers</span> to this power drunk Government that wants to centralise all <span class="highlight">powers</span> in Canberra, <span class="highlight">powers</span> that it has shown quite clearly that it is incapable of exercising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that a great percentage of Tasmanians will be very wary of handing any more <span class="highlight">powers</span> to this centralist, socialist Government of <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Personally I feel that we should not give any more State <span class="highlight">powers</span> to this centralist Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we consider that an adequate and proper control of inflation- so far as these <span class="highlight">powers</span> are concerned- demands the use of both instruments, that is prices and incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is vested with the power it then rests within the discretion of the Government of the day whether it elects to use either power, both <span class="highlight">powers</span> or neither power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We wanted them as joint heads but what the Government now proposes is substantially in accord with the major concept of our proposal which is that both of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be vested in the Government because the exercise of both is the only appropriate way in which, if these <span class="highlight">powers</span> are to be exercised to control inflation, they can be properly exercised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Prices Justification Tribunal is restricted in its operation to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the Commonwealth believes it has as a result of the decision taken in the concrete pipes case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the use made of the <span class="highlight">powers</span>, that depends on Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If legislation is brought along here which is consistent with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are conferred upon the Government by a vote of the people and if we consider that that legislation is inefficient, incompetent and not sufficiently embracing to cover the whole field, then that legislation has poor chance of passing our Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the 2 proposed amendments to the Constitution to give the Government control over prices and incomes are passed at the referendum to be held later this year, will he assure the House that his Government will use both <span class="highlight">powers</span> and not just the power over prices? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The impression has been created here that if a stand had been taken against the Government’s Bill, the Constitution Alteration (Prices) Bill, the referendum would not have taken place and that any conferring of <span class="highlight">powers</span> on the Commonwealth Government could not have taken place because no referendum Bill would have been carried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal-Country Party is implacably opposed to any transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very well, against the centralisation of <span class="highlight">powers</span>, but inevitably it would have had to face the position that the people were to be asked to give one power alone, and that is the power over prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am staggered that, faced with the inevitability of one power only being given, the Liberal-Country Party did not say that if adequate <span class="highlight">powers</span> are to be transferred let it be a balanced power over prices and incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throughout the world- in America, in the United Kingdom and in other places where these <span class="highlight">powers</span> have been given- almost without exception the dual power has been the one which has been exercised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We make this point: If these <span class="highlight">powers</span> are conferred it is within the political disposition of the Government of the day, subject to the Parliament, whether it exercises the power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the solution which hasbeen offered now, althouth it may not be theone which was totally acceptable to us, is atleast reasonably acceptable to us and is acceptable to the Government, and it rests within thedisposition of the Australian people as to whetherthey confer on the national Parliament both <span class="highlight">powers</span>, neither power or one power or the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that the integrity ofthe Government is such that if it is -vested with these; <span class="highlight">powers</span> it will elect to use them in the.interestsof the nation, as the circumstances demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no use anyone suggesting that we in this chamber can lay down with precision the limits to the meaning of the word ‘prices’, the word ‘banking’, the word ‘insurance’, or the other words which are set out in the legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred on this Parliament by section 5 1 of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are <span class="highlight">powers</span> such as the corporations power- power over financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth; there is the banking power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An indication of such legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the administrative arrangements which might be made under the law could well enable a government, given the appropriate laws, to control interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is being given is what has been given before- and in the wisdom of those who drew up the Constitution and of those who drew up other constitutions, these legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> were always given in the broad and general way which is proposed by this measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given both these <span class="highlight">powers</span> the Government will certainly be better equipped to deal with all aspects of the inflationary problem and to introduce broader measures should these prove necessary or desirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to give the impression that the Government, if given these <span class="highlight">powers</span>, will immediately seek to implement rigid policies of control in the whole area of prices and incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We, for our part, take the reasonable view that the possession of both <span class="highlight">powers</span> by the Australian Parliament would be consistent with the position in most other countries and that we should now advance the proposal that it be sought from the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have always had reservations about the value of price control <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But despite the Prime Minister’s reservations on the value of price control <span class="highlight">powers</span>, he was forced, by Caucus, to announce a referendum on the issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inflation, deliberately created and encouraged by the Government, is being used as a bogy for the Government to take unto itself enormous <span class="highlight">powers</span> for the central government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know the Prime Minister will never use the <span class="highlight">powers</span> given to him under this legislation because  Mr Hawke  and the trade unions will not allow him to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That doctrine indicates, we are told by our own experts, that limited military response by the US or other external <span class="highlight">powers</span> to communist insurgency is unlikely to be affected unless accompanied by the fullest self-help by the government concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think that the great <span class="highlight">powers</span> have created a system of understandings which will continue for the foreseeable future and which will mean a peaceful situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know, and everybody else realises that despite the South East Asian conflict there are understandings between those great <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How would that situation affect the balance of power between the major <span class="highlight">powers</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cannot be argued that there is a detente between the main <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today the chance of instability between the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> is as great as the chance of stability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until this problem is solved it cannot be argued, as is argued apparently by the Minister for Repatriation, that there is a detente between the major <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> in our strategic area are jostling for position in the power-balance struggle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Bishop and  Senator Sim  mentioned here tonight that the balance and detente between the great <span class="highlight">powers</span> make large scale international conflict highly unlikely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Political competition among the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> can, of course, be expected to continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said all that, the fact is that the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> or the great <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the world are trying to bring about a situation whereby, owing to some accident or some flare-up, the world will not be destroyed by a nuclear holocaust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I may continue without too many interruptions by fruitless points of order,  Mr President,  I wish to say that the matters to which I wish to refer are the general policy of the Government in relation to inflation, the announcement of the Prime Minister that there is a wide cross-section of matters other than matters debated today which apparently he would like to put to the public of Australia by way of referendum and the importance to the people of Australia of being able to know what the Government wishes to do in relation to them and to what use it intends to put any of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that may be given to it as a result of a particular referendum proposal being accepted by the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 1 3 introduces a new concept of what I understand to be the investigation officers of the Post Office being able to exercise <span class="highlight">powers</span> of detention and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of search. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a person is suspected of being in possession of material, letters and postal articles which he should not have, there may be difficulty in obtaining a police officer who can exercise his <span class="highlight">powers</span> of arrest in order to take the necessary steps. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However I think it is important to recognise under clause 3 that the means by which an officer is appointed are being changed so that officers may be appointed much more easily than they have been in the past; yet they are being given wider <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the proposed legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also established that legal problems can arise when provisions that depend on that power are drafted so as to be inextricably mixed in their operation with provisions that depend on other <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But these provisions are given by clause 5 a separate operation in reliance upon other <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In so doing we should draw to the attention of the world the fact that the challenge runs to the very peace of the world and to the integrity of those kinds of agreements like SALT- the Strategic Arms Limitation Agreement- which in our view have created a significant hallmark in the form of a detente between the great <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whatever we think about the Soviet Union and whatever we think about the United States, there is no doubt that the relationships between those 2 great <span class="highlight">powers</span> will have a great deal to do with the sort of lives that we and our children will live in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the platform adopted by the Labor Party at Launceston undertakings were given that in accordance with the new <span class="highlight">powers</span> acquired by the Australian Government as a result of the 1967 referendum Labor would assume the ultimate responsibility for Aboriginals and establish a Ministery of Aboriginal Affairs with offices in each State to give the Commonwealth a genuine presence in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill provides for the election of 2 senators each for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory and that such senators have the same <span class="highlight">powers</span>, immunities and privileges as senators representing the States; that the first election of Territory senators be held at the same time as the next Senate election in the several States or at the same time as the next general election for members of the House of Representatives, if such is held before or in conjunction with the next Senate election; that the term of the first Territory senators be from the date of their election until the eve of polling day for the ensuing general election for members of the House of Representatives; that after the first election for Territory senators, elections be held at the same time as the general elections for members of the House of Representatives; that after the first election of Territory senators, the terms of Territory senators be the period between each House of Representatives election; and for the Territory senators to be elected under the same system of proportional representation as that currently applicable to the election of senators representing the States, except in the case of a single casual vacancy when such vacancy shall be filled by the holding of a by-election adopting the procedures used for filling a single casual vacancy for a State senator, as far as may be applicable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All honourable senators are aware of that and the Senate would be aware also that the Government is doing everything it can within the economic <span class="highlight">powers</span> of management that it has to see that there is adequate housing for the whole population and especially for those on low incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Might I remind honourable senators that Australia, in common with other middle and smaller <span class="highlight">powers</span>, must be concerned about this war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must be concerned because the stability of any region in which the interests of the 2 super <span class="highlight">powers</span>- that is, the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics- are so vitally engaged must be of concern to nations such as ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is simply its purpose to establish the Commission formally and to set out its <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred on it by the Bill the Commission may, with the approval of the Minister, conduct an inquiry, including a public inquiry, into any matter being investigated by the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mere fact that there may be some opposition to the proposal from some quarters and that the honourable senator may share the opposition on the basis that this representative Parliament should not be given certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> to make laws for the welfare of the people is his own affair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is really based on the fact that we have a dichotomy of <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the industrial field between Federal and State authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that without a grant of <span class="highlight">powers</span> from the States or without a constitutional amendment that situation is insoluble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> to enact laws for conciliation and arbitration and to prevent industrial disputes extend from one particular section of our Commonwealth Constitution, that is, section 51 (xxxv). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have confidence, as I think  Senator Greenwood  mostly has, in the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the courts of this country and in their capacity to construe statutes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are circumstances where the law will be overridden by a direction of any person appointed by the Minister to issue a direction because there is a delegation of <span class="highlight">powers</span> under other sections of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those principles include: That responsibility for control of banks and financial institutions operating in Papua New Guinea be vested in the Papua New Guinea authorities as soon as practicable; that a central bank be established in Papua New Guinea on the basis of the Port Moresby office of the Reserve Bank of Australia and be endowed with a full range of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to act as a central monetary authority for a separate banking system, even though some of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> could not be used in the immediate future; that a national banking institution be established in Papua New Guinea through the setting up of a new Papua New Guinea Government Commercial Bank; and that except where certain accounts give rise to special contractual or financial problems the Papua New Guinea business of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation be transferred to the Papua New Guinea Government Commercial Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This particular proposal of the Government is aimed at broadening the scope of the enforcement provisions by giving certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> to officers of an organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">powers</span> are set out in clause 27. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that ultimately it will have statutory <span class="highlight">powers</span> which will give it teeth and which will make it into an organisation which will work in complete co-operation with the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We accept that the Tasmanian Government has the sole responsibility for this matter because it has the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we speak of the possibility of war arising out of events in the Middle East iri which, without saying anything that would aggravate the situation, there could be a conflict in which the super <span class="highlight">powers</span> would be involved, this is something of an entirely different order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731018_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But a war in which nuclear <span class="highlight">powers</span> could be involved on a world scale would be a devastating experience for’ mankind and the contribution or involvement or otherwise of Australia in such a matter would be so small that it is absurd to suggest that Australia could start even to contemplate having defence forces on  s  scale that would be material to such a world conflict, which would probably be over even before a report could-be made to the Senate of its commencement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731018_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the States the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which they possess under the Constitution? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731018_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Related to this provision is a provision in clause 26 that the  chairman  may constitute a division of the Commission consisting of not less than 3 members with all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission for the purpose of a particular reference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without such Australian participation we will have the prospect of Australian resources and industries being developed to maximise the global profits of multi-national corporations, and very often at lower export prices than if we in Australia were able to match a little closer their monopolistic <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is not in the interests of the Australian people that we should do nothing, or limit our own <span class="highlight">powers</span> in trying to hold our own a little more effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, those investments will have been approved by an independent supervisory council, appointed specifically to watch the interests of those who invest in the National Investment Fund and given appropriate strong <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides an appropriate balance of <span class="highlight">powers</span> between the Board and the Council and includes provision for disputes or disagreements to be resolved by ballot of contributors if necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we must all recognise the gradual shifting of responsibility from the State area to the Commonwealth that was an inevitable feature of the decision of the people of this nation in a referendum vesting in the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the referendum of 1967 certainly gave <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Commonwealth Governmentthe Australian Government as it is now called- to make special laws for Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I disagree with the idea that the Commonwealth should have the <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to the advancement of Aboriginal people centred in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that there will not be duplication and so that the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the Commonwealth sought and received giving it jurisdication over the program of which this Bill is an integral part, this Government has seen fit now to introduce this Bill to provide for arrangements to be made with the States in respect of Aboriginal affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Commonwealth takes over from the States further <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to Aborigines there will be a need for the State employees who have the skills to deal with Aboriginal affairs to transfer to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dealing with the question of what are the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth, I do not know whether anyone could give a legal definition of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> the Commonwealth acquired following the 1967 referendum, or in what areas the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth override those of the States when the States introduce legislation in various fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Commonwealth legislation does override State legislation in this area, there would be very little legislation that we could not introduce at the present time in order to take away completely the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Bryant)  had discussed with all State Ministers this question of <span class="highlight">powers</span> which we could have possessed but have not possessed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> may not need to be used in Papua New Guinea immediately but they will be necessary in due course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure it is not perfect, but set against other examples of administration of countries by overseas <span class="highlight">powers</span> in what might be called a colonial style- I never cared for it but, never mind, we had a kind of guardianship situation in Papua New Guinea- I believe that the Australian people performed the function well, they discharged it with dignity, they dug fairly deeply into their own pockets to fund the development of Papua New Guinea, and I think that it stands to our credit both with the people of Papua New Guinea and with ourselves, and it certainly stands to our credit with the United Nations and those observers who have been to Papua New Guinea from time to time to witness the progress of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The High Commissioner will assume most of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> now held by the Minister for External Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will exercise those <span class="highlight">powers</span> under an Executive Council style of approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from that, one would assume that all other <span class="highlight">powers</span> will be within the competence of the Papua New Guinea House of Assembly and the Papua New Guinea Government under its Chief Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have a variety of <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions which are much the same as the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions which local authorities in Australia have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of these lying statements put out by the Soviet Union in regard to the cause of the conflict, and in view of the fact that a tiny nation of 3 million people is confronted by the Arab nations of 1 10 million people, backed by one of the world’s super <span class="highlight">powers</span>, can the Government still adhere to its declaration of neutrality? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I hardly think that it is appropriate at question time for me to enter into a discussion of whether one side is supported by which super power and which super power is the strongest of the super <span class="highlight">powers</span>, or of the other questions raised by the honourable senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The management of the economy is something which the Federal Government can attend to if it is given appropriate <span class="highlight">powers</span> by this Parliament or by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if this Parliament or one section of it sets out to prevent the Federal Government having ample <span class="highlight">powers</span> to manage the economy, the people of Australia will suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a scheme which gives to the Minister in charge of the legislation enormously wide discretion which no parliament ought to give to any Minister where the <span class="highlight">powers</span> are unqualified and not restricted by way of specific criteria as to the manner in which the discretion should be exercised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with  Senator McManus  that the problem in the Middle East, particularly the way the war started to blow up with both sides being fed by two of the great <span class="highlight">powers</span>, had all the earmarks of what could develop into a world war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For over 1 2 months during the term of the previous Government and my Government I have asked the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that be for these people to have their duties assessed on a work value basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous Government, which was so serious about having full <span class="highlight">powers</span> to impose penalties, never bothered to prescribe any particulars by regulation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the potential of these hostilities and the fact that two of the super <span class="highlight">powers</span> are backing the respective sides concerned, it is fortunate that in spite of that, the detente that came about between the USSR and the US prior to this situation has proved to be an anchor in these very troubled times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When two of the super <span class="highlight">powers</span> are arming both sides, that is potentially dangerous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mollifying that effect has been the fact that the super <span class="highlight">powers</span> have been able to keep talking whilst it has been going on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A miscalculation by either of the great <span class="highlight">powers</span> involved- the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics- could easily have brought about a world war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can hope only that the Arab <span class="highlight">powers</span> will not continue to threaten instability and world stability by pursuing this type of policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also believe- it is referred to in our foreshadowed amendment- that there must be an understanding and an agreement between the 2 major <span class="highlight">powers</span> concerned, the Soviet Union and the United States of America, that they will ensure that there is no massive rearmament and that they will adopt an even handed policy on both sides to ensure that peace is maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret to say it, but peace will be possible, regardless of the Security Council of the United Nations, only when these 2 major <span class="highlight">powers</span> agree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an obligation on other <span class="highlight">powers</span> not to fish in troubled waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Israeli Government claims- this is the purport of the amendments proposed to us tonight by the Democratic Labor Party and by the Liberal Party- that there ought to be direct negotiations between Israel and the contending Arab <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what we are faced with is a conflict which could well lead to a third world war because not only are the people of these countries involved, not only are their territories involved but also questions of the utmost strategic and economic importance to the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the world are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it seems that if there is to be any worsening of the tension and conflict in those areas what we are faced with is a real possibility of a major world war involving the major <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> are confronting each other over the present dispute between Israel and her Arab neighbours the fact remains that the settlement is not one which in the end can be made by the major <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United Nations has no control over issues in which the super <span class="highlight">powers</span> are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that the 2 super <span class="highlight">powers</span>, and not the United Nations, decided whether or not the conflict in the Middle East would go on and whether that conflict would involve the rest of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say still that it is the super <span class="highlight">powers</span> who in the long term will be in the box seat to decide what will happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Israel- perhaps wrongly on that occasionsought a peaceful solution by consultations with the major <span class="highlight">powers</span>- that is all on the record- and finally, when she seemed to be abandoned and standing alone in this isolation that was gradually being forced upon her, launched herself against the Arabian forces that were gathering and wiped them out of existence within 6 days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The two super <span class="highlight">powers</span> are aiding and abetting this bloodbath, this loss of humanitarianism which exists throughout the world towards these people and the loss of all the things which have been built up over a period of years of sacrifice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All this is being lost now because the super powersfor whatever purpose- have made it possible for these death dealing sophisticated weapons to be matched against these nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret to say that although the Government has said that it wants certain legislation and wants to arm the conciliation and arbitration bodies with various <span class="highlight">powers</span> in order to bring about rational solutions to industrial disputes, the Opposition parties have seen fit to frustrate the Government in its intentions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not willing to give the Government the legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> which it said are necessary in order that we may be able to solve industrial disputes in the way in which every one would want them solved, in an atmosphere of rationality and conciliation so that there would not be these industrial disruptions which affect, most of all, the workers and their families who are involved as well as interfering with the general life of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee had considered certain hypotheses because the extent of the Commonwealth’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the States’ <span class="highlight">powers</span> was unknown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On either hypothesis there is a clear warrant, in the Committee’s view, for co-operative arrangements to be made by the Commonwealth and the States, and on any view of what the Commonwealth and States’ <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the off-shore areas are (other than complete State control) the need for a scheme under which off-shore operators deriving their authority from the Commonwealth may expect complementary facilities on shore from State authority is self-evident. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, the permanent members of the Security Council, which are most of the big <span class="highlight">powers</span>, are excluded from providing members of the force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee may delegate to the  Chairman  and Director jointly all or any of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> and when <span class="highlight">powers</span> so delegated are exercised they shall be deemed to have been exercised by the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Japan is our major trading partner in the world and China is the only one of the world ‘s 5 major <span class="highlight">powers</span> with which, until last December, we have not had any meaningful or regular official contact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It sought to have as its philosophy a communication to the great <span class="highlight">powers</span> on this earth that they should not merely be so pre-occupied with their own great power- or thuggery in many ways- but that they should respect the right of the little people to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer firstly to the Middle East which is accepted by the Government and by  Senator Wriedt,  who is at the table, as being a theatre that could accelerate into world conflict and, secondly, to the fact that on the Russian-Chinese border there are some 44 divisions of Russians and this is recognised or felt to be a major possibility of conflict between those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are indeed very wide <span class="highlight">powers</span>, so wide that the structure of the Commission is of paramount importance if it is to have the chance it warrants to succeed and satisfy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Notwithstanding those limitations on the Tribunal’s <span class="highlight">powers</span>, the Tribunal itself is obviously starting to have some effect on what would otherwise be increases in prices adding to inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee is not satisfied with the explanations given for this practice and is led to the conclusion that the overseas parent companies have been using their monopoly <span class="highlight">powers</span> to obtain windfall profits from the Australian upvaluations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first substantive clause is clause 5, which empowers the Minister and the Secretary to delegate their <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the Act, subject to the reservation of licensing <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to foreign vessels, fish processing and fish carrying vessels which may be delegated by the Minister or Secretary for Primary Industry only to officers of the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 5 also gives effect in the Act to the principle that an official upon whom statutory <span class="highlight">powers</span> are conferred should be subject to the directions of the Minister in the exercise of those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>as defined, to delegate all of his <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the Act to a Minister of the Papua New Guinea Government, who is further empowered by this clause to exercise those <span class="highlight">powers</span> independently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 6 gives effect to the principle that an official on whom statutory <span class="highlight">powers</span> are conferred should exercise those <span class="highlight">powers</span> in accordance with directions given by the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also takes a further step in the transfer of power to Papua New Guinea by enabling the Minister for External Territories to delegate his <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this Act to the appropriate Minister in the Papua New Guinea Government who may exercise those <span class="highlight">powers</span> independently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 8 empowers the Minister to close an area to the taking of a specified sedentary organism except by persons or by the use of boats with licences endorsed to permit the taking of that sedentary organism in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The mode in which its <span class="highlight">powers</span>, privileges, and immunities may be exercised and upheld: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And whereas the Governments of the Commonwealth and of the States have decided, in the national interest, that, without raising questions concerning, and without derogating from, their respective constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>, they should co-operate for the purpose of ensuring the legal  effeciveness  of authorities to explore for or to exploit the petroleum resources of  those  submerged lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By that paragraph in the preamble the Australian Government set aside its constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> and entered into arrangement with the States to administer the areas off-shore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It must be remembered that the purpose of the mirror legislation was to use all the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> of Australia, wherever they may lie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Parliament has only the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that it asserts it has- no other <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a question of what the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth are under its external affairs power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I speak to my Leader who is the present Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  he will tell me that there is no question about the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth under the external affairs power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>the Royalty Act should be amended to provide for payment of royalties to authority exercising <span class="highlight">powers</span> of DA. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Section 5 1 of the Australian Constitution spells out the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Parliament and states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are necessary to control and subdue inflation, all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which all governments of the past 72 years had and with which they were able to control inflation, and which over 2 decades enabled them to record low inflation rates averaging 2.5 per cent in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was achieved without extra <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is saying: ‘We will ask the people by referendum on 8 December to give us <span class="highlight">powers</span> over prices and incomes- although, in fact, because the trade unions and the left wing will not let us, we will not use the incomes power’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that this is one further step by the Government to achieve centralised <span class="highlight">powers</span>, not just over a harmless word or a seemingly harmless word called ‘prices’, but over virtually the complete private sector of the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill proposes that such senators will have the same <span class="highlight">powers</span>, immunities and privileges as State senators and that both senators for each Territory will be elected under a system of proportional representation at the time of each general election of members of the House of Representatives, provided that the first election of the Territory senators will be held at the time of the next election of State senators if such is held prior to a general election of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator McManus  said that Senate representation of the Territories would whittle away the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Drake-Brockman mentioned that if Senate representation were given to the people in the territories we would be whittling away the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate and that this Bill was the thin edge of the wedge for the abolition of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition cannot promote the old scare tactic that if these people are given a vote this will whittle away the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate and that eventually this House will be abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The kernel of the Senate (Representation of Territories) Bill, which my illustrious leader has submitted to the Senate, provides for the election of 2 senators each for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory and for such senators to have the same <span class="highlight">powers</span>, immunities and privileges as senators who represent the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that Victoria will be handing over those <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Committee commenced its work at 5 minutes past 2 o’clock and I would have been quite entitled within my <span class="highlight">powers</span> as  Chairman  to have adjourned the Committee at 10 o’clock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Board is charged with a very high responsibility and the Government has to assume that that responsibility is being discharged bona fide in the proper exercise of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Board, with due regard to the rights of persons affected by the exercise of these <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government wants these <span class="highlight">powers</span> so that it can reach out and congeal the private sector, control it and stultify it so that the public sector can grow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also established that legal problems can arise when provisions that depend on that power are drafted so as to be inextricably mixed in their operation with provisions that depend on other <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But these provisions are given by clause 5 a separate operation in reliance upon other <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will have <span class="highlight">powers</span> of decision and is of corporate status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The protection of the Habeas Corpus Act is whittled away by the extensive <span class="highlight">powers</span> of arrest given to police and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> to detain those who are thought to be mentally ill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the absence of a constitutionally entrenched Bill of Rights, it is proposed that those rights should be set out in legislation of this Parliament, so far as it is within the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Parliament to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is anxious to ensure that the Schools Commission is realistically constructed and that it operates with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions which were suggested for it by the then Opposition, now the Government, prior to the election and for which the Government claims that it has a mandate to legislate, if it has a mandate at all, and which were promised so very clearly by the present Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  when speaking on the general subject on 20 June 1 972 in an address to the Catholic Luncheon Club of Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So what we are dealing with here is a division of <span class="highlight">powers</span> under different sections of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Article 26 of the United Nations Chaner of Human Rights and in particular the prior right of parents to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children; (aa) the obligation for governments to provide or assist in the provision and maintenance of educational opportunities for all children which are of the highest standard and which recognise the prior right of parents to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children and where provided and maintained by or on behalf of a government ensure that these opportunities are open without fees or religious tests, to all children; (ab) the rights and <span class="highlight">powers</span> pursuant to the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act of the State Governments in relation to education; (ac) the need for research into education standards, quality, variety and opportunities in Australia; (ad) the importance of the improvement of the quality of education available to all students attending primary and secondary schools; ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third amendment which we would suggest is that regard should be had to the rights and <span class="highlight">powers</span> pursuant to the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act of the State governments in relation to education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, we wish to see that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister are limited to the extent that he appoints committees which are related to the functions as defined in clause 13 of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a principle which is well known to all honourable senators that such <span class="highlight">powers</span> as are given to Ministers by Bills such as this should be limited in regard to what the Minister may do in the exercise of the power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Bill will join the 3 proposals for alteration of the Constitution at present before the Senatethe proposals for simultaneous elections of the Senate and the House of Representatives, for democratic electorates, and for <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to local government finances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This relates to a mutual reference of <span class="highlight">powers</span> between the national Parliament and the Parliaments of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe any council which has consultative <span class="highlight">powers</span> only is useless- in fact Aborigines are still going to go begging and asking through a whole lot of red tape- they still can’t make any decisions and ‘their’ representatives don’t have the same <span class="highlight">powers</span> as the Parliamentarians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will be an advisory committee and, if it works out successfully with the goodwill of white people and black people in this country, I hope that it eventually will become a statutory body with certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> that will be vested in it as a statutory body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Before the suspension of the sitting I was making some observations on the remote implications of the Bill which is before the Senate- the State’s Grants (Capital Assistance) Bill- and drawing attention to those wider implications so far as they seem to indicate the need for a redefinition of the relative <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth and the States so that the States would have a real and viable sovereignty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am also advised that there is a similar provision of delegation in the Scholarships Act 1969, section 19(1) relating to <span class="highlight">powers</span> of delegation, which states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span>, privileges and authorities of the Parliament extend to, and apply within, the Parliamentary grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was explained that some words should go in there to make it clear that we are not delimiting the <span class="highlight">powers</span>, privileges and authorities insofar as they may extend in 2 places- outside Parliament House and in the present parliamentary grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It may be necessary even to say: ‘The <span class="highlight">powers</span>, privileges and authorities of the Parliament and of each house.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking for myself, I would think that the words: ‘The <span class="highlight">powers</span>, privileges and authorities of the Parliament’ would certainly include the authorities of either House of Parliament and would certainly include the authorities of any committees of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I suggest that it is much more in keeping with our purpose and our self-respect to accept clause S with all the assurance that the <span class="highlight">powers</span>, privileges and authorities of the Parliament are not to extend simply to this edifice or the new edifice but are to extend to the boundaries of the Parliamentary grounds but are not to be restricted to them in deference to  Senator Murphy’s  view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span>, privileges, and immunities of the Senate and the House of Representatives, and of the members and the committees of each House, shall be such as are declared by the Parliament, and until declared shall be those of the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom, and of its members and committees, at the establishment of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not know why in this Bill there has been a shift in the language from ‘<span class="highlight">powers</span>, privileges and immunities’ to ‘<span class="highlight">powers</span>, privileges and authorities’ and a restriction of the Parliament, when the general and extremely important provision on which the whole operation, a few trifles apart, of this Parliament depends is these words in section 49 of the Constitution: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the acquisition of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> by the Parliament of the Commonwealth would constitute a major step towards the achievement of the obvious objective of the present Federal Government- the eventual abolition of the States: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the acquisition of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> by the Parliament of the Commonwealth by reason of the lack of definition as to their scope and use would be a source of confusion and uncertainty to, and could be a source of oppression against, the citizens of the State in the conduct of thenaffairs: therefore doth agree and resolve- that the conferring of <span class="highlight">powers</span> on the Parliament of the Commonwealth as proposed is inimical to the welfare of the citizens of Queensland and that accordingly the Assembly is totally and irrevocably opposed to such conferral: and further doth agree to authorise <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why I am not prepared to concede to this Parliament, and certainly not to this Goverment, the extensive <span class="highlight">powers</span> which it is seeking by means of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By the same token the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth Government are clear in relation to defence and the protection of our fishing beds and so on against any foreign intruders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will leave the States no <span class="highlight">powers</span> whatsoever in regard to mining activities in this vast area which is adjacent to their territories and which every citizen of whatever State may be concerned regards as part and parcel of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, it will whittle away any <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the States might have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one is a centralist then presumably one would believe that the Commonwealth should, upon every occasion and in every circumstance, exercise its <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the full irrespective of whether such an exercise would lead to duplication of administrative authorities and disharmony between the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is submitted that the question cannot, and should not, be approached from the standpoint of whether the Commonwealth and the States have exercised their <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the fullest extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Letters Patent, the last one of October 1900 which defines the area  or  our responsibility, and subject to international law, certain provisions of English law such as the Colonial Laws Validity Act and the Merchant Shipping Act, subject to treaties and subject to reservations of bills under the Instructions to the Governor or under the Letters Patent, we had all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and authority of the British Parliament in relation to this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I look upon the preservation of the State rights in this matter as having a safety factor to it and presenting a better aspect than passing over the whole of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The provision that says that the sovereignty of the territorial sea is vested in and exercisable by the Crown in the right of the Commonwealth does not exclude consistent lawslaws of the State that are consistent with laws of the Commonwealth made in the course of exercising its constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How could a Bill of a Federal Parliament give to this new continental off-shore area equivalent <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the Constitution by sections 101,121 and 122 gives to a territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I am saying is that in the proper exercise of national <span class="highlight">powers</span> the Parliament has said that insofar as sovereignty shall be exercised by the Commonwealth over the territorial sea - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one can tell me that by passing this Bill saying that sovereignty shall prevail we cannot extend the <span class="highlight">powers</span> vested in this Parliament by the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I pay tribute to the speech that we heard from  Senator Cant  on this matter putting together the various conceptions of our <span class="highlight">powers</span> in this respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is provision for the registration of instruments, and there are very wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the Minister to grant and refuse, to impose conditions which he determines and to cancel any of the authorities, licences or permits which may have been granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report then listed 8.5 pages of references to <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Designated Authority under that legislation, and under this Bill it is not a designated authority- there is simply a Ministerrevealing the tremendously wide area in which the action to be taken is to be within the Designated Authority’s discretion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is to be linked with other provisions in the Bill, in particular clauses 93, 94 and 95, which provide that the Minister or any person to whom he delegates his <span class="highlight">powers</span> may summon a person to produce documents, to appear before him, to give any information, or to answer questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it not correct to say that some of the overseas experiences in the operation of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> quoted by  Mr Winter  certainly do not support the idea that they are necessary to combat inflation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know also that it is generally recognised that the Australian Government does not have the legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> which would enable it properly to manage the economy of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that there would be very few people- I trust that the honourable senator is not amongst them- who would think that the Commonwealth Government ought not to be given the <span class="highlight">powers</span> per medium of the Australian Parliament to take the administrative action pursuant to laws made by this Parliament which would enable us to curb inflation and to manage the economy properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is ironical that the Australian Labor Party, which professed to want to see a return to Parliamentary Government, has been in Government accelerating the arbitrary nature of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are held by the Federal Government and seeking to increase them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It does not contain any words saying that those <span class="highlight">powers</span> are to be carried out in conformity with a federal system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the Labor Party’s recent conference at Surfers Paradise it sought to achieve that end by requiring that it be an obligation of any Labor member of a State Parliament to assist in the reference to this Commonwealth Parliament of such <span class="highlight">powers</span> as may be necessary to carry out those policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Much can be achieved by Labor members of the State Parliaments in effectuating Labor’s aim of more effective <span class="highlight">powers</span> for the national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the suspension of the sitting for lunch I had established the rapidity with which and the extent to which this socialist Government has been concentrating <span class="highlight">powers</span> on the old bureaucracy in Canberra and conferring new <span class="highlight">powers</span> on a whole range of new bureaucratic structures that are being created by it in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to the acceleration of power concentration in Canberra, which I have been denouncing, to cap it all this socialist Government is asking the Australian electorate on 8 December to give it more <span class="highlight">powers</span>- to give it the widest possible <span class="highlight">powers</span> to legislate in relation to prices and incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is saying that it wants these <span class="highlight">powers</span> in order to deal with inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has many <span class="highlight">powers</span> by which it can deal with inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has been offered by the State governments a temporary referral of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to cope with inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It already has many <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the Constitution which it can use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prices Justification Tribunal was set up under <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the Government already possessed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, in my opinion, it is quite clear that the purpose of this referendum which is seeking more <span class="highlight">powers</span> for this socialist Government in Canberra has nothing to do with any desire on the part of the Government to fight inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason it wants these <span class="highlight">powers</span> is to allow it to implement its centralist, unificationist policies, and I have already quoted the Prime Minister and the Labor Party platform in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government wants this referendum carried on 8 December so that it will have more <span class="highlight">powers</span> to act arbitrarily and arrogantly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It wants plenary <span class="highlight">powers</span>, as the Government calls them, to put into effect its socialist policies of having a unitary system of government and of abolishing State parliaments and State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It wants these <span class="highlight">powers</span> because they are part and parcel of the ultimate socialist objective of destroying the federal system and establishing a unitary system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only does the Government want more <span class="highlight">powers</span> in Canberra, but also it wants all these <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be concentated in one House of Parliament in Canberra, because it is notoriously well known that the Government wishes to abolish this Senate which is probably the last real bastion of defence that the people and the States have for this federal system as we know it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Durack,  again for mysterious reasons, says that the establishment of these consultative councils is a concentration of excessive and arbitrary <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government knows that these people will never support its socialisation platform and the centralist <span class="highlight">powers</span> that it wants to achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the next 10 days or so the Government will try to fool the people of Australia with a referendum seeking price control <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It brings them in only through the back door, as it is seeking to do by way of the prices and incomes referendum to be held on Saturday week in the hope that the people will be fooled into giving <span class="highlight">powers</span> to this centralist Government under the guise that these <span class="highlight">powers</span> will control inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> will be used in all sorts of directions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once it is able by these means to place industry in a situation of difficulty the Government has only to use the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of taxation and tariffs to put industry into further difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the people of this nation are prepared to give the Government price control <span class="highlight">powers</span>, the Government will have the final weapon it needs to bring industry right down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the <span class="highlight">powers</span>, old as they are, which we are exercising and under which we are governing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is complete and utter rot for members of Parliament to say that we are using excessive and arbitrary <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are using the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which were given to us and we will continue to use those <span class="highlight">powers</span> and to extend them as far as the Constitution will allow in order that the Australian people may have good and active governmentnot a government of the kind they have had over the past 23 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To move this sort of motion which talks about concentrated excessive and arbitrary <span class="highlight">powers</span> of government in Canberra and not be able to point to one instance where the Government has exceeded the <span class="highlight">powers</span> given to it is complete and utter hypocrisy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Cant  mentioned earlier that he would not agree that there are excessive <span class="highlight">powers</span> operating from Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not unexpected that we find this big buildup of centralism in Canberra; nor is it unexpected that at the same time we should find a determined effort on the part of this Government to erode State governments and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of State governments with the ultimate aim of the eventual abolition or destruction of State governments throughout the Commonwealth as we know them today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my colleague  Senator Cant  said in his address, this urgency motion regarding excessive and arbitrary <span class="highlight">powers</span> in Canberra is a phoney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us have a look at the measures which have emanated from a government which, it is alleged, is self interested in gaining additional <span class="highlight">powers</span> at the expense of the Australian public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are these the actions of a Government that is seeking excessive <span class="highlight">powers</span> and centralist control, or of a dictatorial Government that has a disregard for the welfare of its people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us ask the Australian people whether all these things which I have enumerated regarding social welfare, education and so on have been achieved as a result of the rapid concentration of excessive and arbitrary <span class="highlight">powers</span> in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I hear Ministers talk about plenary <span class="highlight">powers</span> I am reminded of another gentleman who always spoke of obtaining plenary <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the Ministers of this Government might remember that when they start speaking about wishing to obtain plenary <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is another body of opinion which is extremely concerned that on a reasonable and acceptable interpretation of some of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are laid down in one of the other Bills there could be by various means a substantial transfer of public ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not say that the wine industry is a basic developmental project in fact or in terms of the AIDC’s very limited <span class="highlight">powers</span> to act according to the present law, which is of course affected by what the Senate is doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is quite conceivable that with the wide scope of this section of the Constitution and the incidental <span class="highlight">powers</span>, the Commonwealth could control nontrade, non-commerce and also non-interstate matters provided it could be shown that the regulated matter assisted the exercise of or was an appropriate means to the grant under section 5 1 ( 1 ). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An Associate Commissioner shall be deemed to be a Commissioner for the purposes of the exercise of any <span class="highlight">powers</span>, or the performance of any functions or duties, of a Commissioner in relation to an inquiry and report by a Division of the Commission of which the Associate Commissioner is a member, . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the  Chairman  under paragraph (2) (a) or (b) shall be exercised only after consultation with the Commissioners.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not of any great moment but if those words sought to be omitted by the amendment are omitted it would mean that the  Chairman  could not exercise such <span class="highlight">powers</span> until he had consulted the commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that perhaps it is a matter more appropriately to be brought up in discussing Part III of the Bill which deals with the functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Webster made reference to what the functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission really mean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On reflection I now consider that the reasons I had for differentiating the time period as between different forms of assistance in relation to the Commission’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> of initiative were not strong enough to justify ten years in one case and six in the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we object in the strongest terms to the proposal to set up the Commission as a bureaucratic central planning authority with <span class="highlight">powers</span> and influences that should belong only to the Government and the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So wide are the <span class="highlight">powers</span> proposed to be given to the Commission that it will be able to initiate its own inquiries without being asked to do so by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-by leave- On behalf of the Senate Select Committee on the Civil Rights of Migrant Australians and in the absence of the  Chairman, Senator Townley,  who is ill and who has appointed me Acting  Chairman  of the Committee in accordance with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the terms of reference, I wish to seek an extension of time for the presentation of the Committee’s report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assert here and now that the people of Australia should be well aware that there is certainly no need to give more power to this Government or any other government in Canberra, because the Government has adequate economic <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">powers</span> have worked with previous governments so far as the nation’s economic conditions are concerned, and particularly with relation to inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He then went on to say that the Federal Government had adequate <span class="highlight">powers</span> to ensure that the Australian people were protected against foreign control without banning or limiting foreign investment in particular projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure the Australian public will understand that if inflation is to be effectively tackled by the Australian Government, the Australian Parliament must have proper and effective <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister may give directions to the Board concerning the performance of its functions and the exercise of its <span class="highlight">powers</span>, and the Board shall comply with those directions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will vote against the Bill because it is unnecessary, because it is a further erosion of the Constitution and because it is an underhand way of grabbing <span class="highlight">powers</span> from the States to centralise arbitrary power in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last session, Parliament passed the Grants Commission Bill 1973 which widened the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission to enable it to investigate and recommend upon applications for financial assistance by regional groupings of local authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> of delegation under the principal Act relating to the determination of compensation for land acquired or to be acquired by compulsory process is limited to $1,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These functions include the control of the export from Australia of fresh apples and pears and the Corporation has been given, in clauses 7 to 9, <span class="highlight">powers</span> appropriate to the performance of these functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is also expressed in clause 7 (3) of the Bill a general requirement that the Corporation must comply with any directions given it by the Minister with respect to the performance of its functions and the exercise of its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Corporation will provide the industry with a marketing instrument directed by persons with the necessary skills and expertise in the broad field of marketing; it will be armed with appropriate and adequate <span class="highlight">powers</span>; and, accordingly, should be capable of tackling effectively the industry’s problems on a co-ordinated national basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to  Senator Lawrie  and, to a lesser degree, to  Senator Little  that it is obvious that we must have some punitive <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to vessels which fish inside our territorial sea limits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as I have said, what is suggested by the Australian Government is not comparable with the punitive measures embodied in the successful expeditions that have been embarked upon by Iceland and Latin American countries against what may be deemed the super <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But whether they be super <span class="highlight">powers</span> or middle <span class="highlight">powers</span>, if other countries see a bit of firmness they will capitulate and do what is wanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Commission, in the discharge of its functions, will have certain <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the width of those <span class="highlight">powers</span>, the scope of those <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the purposes to which they are to be put which is positively frightening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General will recall that some 60 years ago both the High Court and the Privy Council entertained much argument in a case in which the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth was the active participant and in which it was sought to justify the act of a royal commission in this country which had wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> that could have enabled it to move into virtually any and every area throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of this investigation the Commission is to have very wide <span class="highlight">powers</span>, not merely facilitatory <span class="highlight">powers</span> but compulsory <span class="highlight">powers</span> to an extraordinary degree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any directions of the Attorney-General in connection with the performance of its functions or the exercise of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But a ministerial control of that character is a control which tells the Commission with all these <span class="highlight">powers</span> how to act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the ordinary way in which the Commission gets its information and exercises its <span class="highlight">powers</span> it is under the obligation to submit to what the Attorney-General directs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no limit, except relevance, to the Commission’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> if it considers, or if the Attorney-General has directed, that the documents be produced or the questions answered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What ‘reasonable excuse’, having regard to the tremendous width of the Commission’s <span class="highlight">powers</span>, can such people offer to refuse to produce books and papers or to answer questions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When these <span class="highlight">powers</span> are read with the ministerial <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are contained in clause 8 they are positively frightening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one examines the Law Reform Commission Bill of the Australian Capital Territory, the projected law reform Bill in Victoria and other law reform Bills throughout the Commonwealth one finds that none has the scope or width of <span class="highlight">powers</span> contained in this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to the Attorney-General that a power given to a commission of individuals- notwithstanding the desirable objective of the appointment of that commission- to enable it to call any person in the country to appear before it, to require persons to answer questions about virtually any subject at all and to produce whatever documents, books, writings and papers they have, is comparable to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which were used by the Secretaries of State in the 18th century and which John Wilkes was able to challenge so forcefully through the courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret the right of the Commission to inquire and to exercise the compulsory <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are contained in” this Bdi- and shortly to be removed from the Bill- should be finding their way into other legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that it needs those <span class="highlight">powers</span> which were sought to be given to it to enable it to perform its role in a worthwhile and useful way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However this point can be over-dramatised when one remembers that the same kind of <span class="highlight">powers</span> are held by each of the courts in the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take the point that was made but to suggest that this is frightening is to take matters a bit far when these <span class="highlight">powers</span> relate to hearings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are given to such a body are conditioned by the same conditions as apply generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any such <span class="highlight">powers</span>, whether they are to summon witnesses or to have a hearing, are to be exercised in a bona fide way and for the purposes for which they were given and with due regard to the rights of persons affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Insofar as the second point the honourable senator raised is concerned, the Bill does use the term ‘secretary’ but it was pointed out in the second reading speech that clause 5 also gives effect in the Act to the principle that an official upon whom statutory <span class="highlight">powers</span> are conferred should be subject to the directions of the Minister in the exercise of those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apparently the new corporation, commission or whatever it is called, is to have great <span class="highlight">powers</span> to determine how the land can be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 5 of the Albury-Wodonga Development Bill refers to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred on the Minister, and it reads in part: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second part of the clause points out that the Australian Minister may exercise all or any of the functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> relating to a designated area conferred on him by or under a State Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Minister shall exercise these <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred on him in accordance with the Agreement or he can exercise such <span class="highlight">powers</span> as are conferred on him by a State Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am putting to the Senate this afternoon that the facts I have raised have some relationship to clause 5 of the Bill which deals with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I think that the Senate can be confident that the laws are such that the court has, as it always had, ample <span class="highlight">powers</span> to safeguard its own integrity and that the procedures which are appropriate will be adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill establishes the Hospitals and Health Services Commission on a permanent and sound legal basis, enumerates its functions and gives it all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> necessary to enable it to operate effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission is given adequate <span class="highlight">powers</span> to allow it to perform its functions, including the power to hold private and public inquiries, and to engage outside consultants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State governments have utilised their <span class="highlight">powers</span> to acquire the land, to fix prices and to deal with other questions associated with the acquisition of the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seek from the Minister some details in relation to clause 8 of the Albury-Wodonga Development Bill, which establishes the functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Extensive use has been made of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> to invest State courts with federal jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, the present Bill avoids the historical excursions that would have been necessary to determine the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Superior Court under the 1968 Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Bill conferred certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> on the Superior Court by reference to the state of affairs in England immediately before the commencement of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was done to ensure that the Court would have the <span class="highlight">powers</span> formerly possessed by a Court of Equity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems unnecessary to import historical references of this kind into the Bill as it is sufficient for the Court to be given a general jurisdiction to enable it to exercise whatever <span class="highlight">powers</span> are available to a Superior Court of Record. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present, there is provision in each of the 2 Territories for practitioners to be admitted to the Supreme Court of the particular Territory and for that Court to exercise disciplinary <span class="highlight">powers</span> over the conduct of legal practitioners so admitted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These Bills stem from a belief on the part of the Government that the health of the people is the foundation upon which all their happiness and all their <span class="highlight">powers</span> as a nation will be built. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is acting well within the framework of the Constitution and under the legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> available to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within the past week or so, the Government has used its export <span class="highlight">powers</span> to begin an inventory control over oil supplies which means that an oil company wishing to sell bunker oil to an overseas ship must apply for an export permit for that oil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill vests in the Petroleum and Minerals Authority the same functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to these other minerals as it does in relation to petroleum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the States too, at the moment, have an important part to play in this area in exercising their internal licensing <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The exercise of State internal licensing <span class="highlight">powers</span> without due regard to the Australian Government’s export control <span class="highlight">powers</span> could place the licensee companies in a wholly unreasonable and unfair position, when the national Government is impelled, by policy, to act in the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part II of the Bill deals with the establishment, functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, clauses 6 and 7 will authorise the Authority to undertake activities appropriate to a petroleum and mining business and, in association with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred upon the Authority by clauses 11 and 12, to undertake these functions in the same way as companies engaged in these fields of activities do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is not adequate time to probe, to ask questions, to search for information and really to consider whether the concept is best given expression by vesting all authority for this Institute in one man and by giving to that one man wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> to create his staff, to employ consultants and to devise as he goes along the objectives which are set out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As mentioned by  Senator Withers,  during the debate on this Bill in another place the Opposition drew attention to the possibility that there may be dangers in the <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred upon the Minister in acquiring by agreement land and interests in land on behalf of the Australian Government unless this is accompanied by a public statement concerning the exercise of these <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed Corporation, which is given very wide <span class="highlight">powers</span>, has ahead of it a major work better to facilitate the distribution of the apple crop and the pear crop both in Australia and overseas by means of promotional activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Powers</span> are being given to the Corporation to charter its own ships, where necessary, for the export of the fruit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Corporation, as I said before, are very wide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is in relation to the Corporation’s power to buy and sell that this Bill makes a significant addition to the old <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Corporation shall comply with any directions given to it by the Minister with respect to the performance of its functions and the exercise of its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Corporation shall not exercise its <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this section in a manner that gives preference to one State or any pan of one State over another State or any part of another State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> of direction which are written into the Bill are not designed for the purpose of interfering with the business discretion of the people who will operate the Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>7 ) That the presence of three members of the Committee shall be necessary to constitute a meeting of the Committee for the exercise of its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#subdebate-10-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no question that we rely on penal <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party and the Labor Government have made it clear that they support what the united trade union movement wants, that is, fewer penal <span class="highlight">powers</span> and more collective arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think more strikes occur because we do not have more facilities and more <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the law to negotiate with the aggrieved parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To a large extent the major difficulties between the United States of America and the Soviet Union, and perhaps to a lesser extent between the United States of America and China, have been resolved as a result of some of the initiatives taken by the major <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators remember’ 1984’, what he spoke of was a division of the world into 2 huge areas in each of which a dominant power was able to control the destinies and the lives of the people who were living under the suzerainty of those 2 super <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that while all of us welcome the relaxation in tension between the Soviet Union and the U.S.A., we should be very cautious lest a consequence of such a relaxation could be a division of spoils between 2 super <span class="highlight">powers</span> with neither of which democratic people have a great deal in common. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must see that while we support the relaxation between those 2 major <span class="highlight">powers</span>- those 2 super <span class="highlight">powers</span>- we do not fall into the weakness of saying: ‘Well, everything is fixed up between these 2 countries and we will just leave it to them’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we look at the 2 major <span class="highlight">powers</span> I believe that again we have reason for reservations as to what our future may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With this in mind Liberal Party senators noted with pleasure the Queen’s statement for the Prime Minister that his Government intends to pursue its policies to the utmost by using its constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> resolutely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Political commentators would have us believe that this statement about using constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> constituted a threat by the Prime Minister of a double dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The words would make more sense if directed by the Prime Minister to his Caucus, for I would imagine that if Caucus makes the Prime Minister back down on many more issues he just might use his constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> to take them all back to the electorate, even if some of them would be left swinging. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Would honourable senators expect a working class organisation, in trying to deal with prices, to refuse even the slight <span class="highlight">powers</span> that it has to make an examination of food and clothing prices? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What referendum proposals are generally all about is the transfer of further and other <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Federal Government, <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the State governments previously had as part of their residual <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have  said  before today and I will go on saying as long as I am privileged to be a senator, that one of the great <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Parliament and one of the reasons for the second chamber is that it gives time for the people of Australia to be informed by the media and by other means of what has transpired in another place and what is coming up to the Senate for decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>And whereas our existing Australian Flag and our national anthem, ‘God Save The Queen’, are perpetual reminders of these hard-won freedoms and of the wise British principle of the division of power, so well reflected in our own Australian Constitution with its careful separation of <span class="highlight">powers</span> as between the Crown and Commonwealth Parliament, the Senate, the State Parliaments, the GovernorGeneral and State Governors, and the Independent Courts of Justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Leave out all words after ‘That’, insert ‘in the opinion of this Senate, it would be a travesty of constitutional and parliamentary practice if this Bill, which so vitally affects the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and independence of this Senate, were to be rushed through the parliamentary processes and submitted to the people without the most careful examination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment commences by stating that it would be a travesty of constitutional and parliamentary practice if this Bill, which so vitally affects the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and independence of this Senate, were to be rushed through the proper parliamentary processes and submitted to the people without the most careful examination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government feels that the present restrictive constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> are not in the best interests of the good government of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances it is presumptuous for people to claim that the Senate is almost trespassing beyond its <span class="highlight">powers</span> by intervening and stultifying in some way the opinion of the House on a matter involving this fundamental question of alterations to the Australian Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 12 July 1951 the Constitution Alteration (<span class="highlight">Powers</span> to Deal with Communists and Communism) Bill 1951 was introduced into the Senate shortly before noon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Constitution to enable interchange of <span class="highlight">powers</span> between the Australian Parliament and the State parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There already is a provision in the Constitution, in section 51, paragraph (XXX- VII), for reference of <span class="highlight">powers</span> by State parliaments to the Australian Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there are several unresolved questions on the operation of the existing provision for the States to refer <span class="highlight">powers</span> to this Parliament which have made them reluctant to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that, during the first meeting of the Constitutional Convention in September last year, heads of delegations agreed in principle that the Constitution should be altered to allow for interchanges of <span class="highlight">powers</span> and to remove the existing doubts about the operation of the present power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, the Prime Minister announced our intention that, in any interchange of <span class="highlight">powers</span>, whether from the Commonwealth to the States or the States to the Commonwealth, the same provisions should be available as to duration, revocability and the power to apply terms and conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other proposed new section- section 108b- contains the provisions concerning terms and conditions, duration and revocability applicable to interchange of <span class="highlight">powers</span> whether from the Commonwealth to the States or the States to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To illustrate, if the Australian Parliament desired to empower the States to levy a tax which technically came within the category of excise duties, as to which the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this Parliament are exclusive, it would not seem appropriate to speak of the Australian Parliament referring the matter, for the power of the Australian Parliament as regards excise is to levy a Commonwealth tax to be paid into the Commonwealth Treasury and not a State tax paid into the State Treasury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A designation of a matter by the Australian Parliament is to be possible- indeed, this is the principal purpose of the new provision- in respect of its otherwise exclusive <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The doubts that the States have felt about their <span class="highlight">powers</span> to revoke or impose conditions should be removed by the express provisions of this section. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that these provisions will encourage the States to refer to this Parliament <span class="highlight">powers</span> such as family law, defamation and shipping and navigation which, in this context, have been raised at the Constitutional Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposed alteration to the Constitution contained in this Bill, if approved by the people, will introduce a degree of flexibility in the distribution of <span class="highlight">powers</span> under our Constitution that has been lacking for far too long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But there must be a fairly complete dialogue between now and then, and the proper place for such a dialogue is obviously in this Parliament so that the representatives of the States in the Commonwealth Parliament- the senators assembled here- can investigate, examine and disclose what is implicit and what are the consequences of this legislation for the information of those who ultimately have to determine the redistribution of <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At a time when profound changes are taking place in the patterns of international relations, it is particularly important that the role of small and medium <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be understood and appreciated, and that they should seize the opportunities for greater independence … <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not against the transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> from the States to the Commonwealth where it can be clearly shown that the Commonwealth can more efficiently administer these <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe there is strong argument for the transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> from the Commonwealth to the States when it can be shown that the States can more effectively administer the <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that it is the policy of the Government to centralise greater power in Canberra and in the process to decrease the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This, it has been suggested by the speakers for the Opposition, represents some form of conspiracy, some endeavour to reduce the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of local government and to create some new situation with respect to local government and its access to the Loan Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that it is not just an attempt to subvert the authority of State governments and an attempt to centralise further <span class="highlight">powers</span> in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today people are becoming very concerned because of the policies of this Government, particularly in relation to centralism, because of the erosion of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the States, and because of Government expenditure and the automatic wastage of revenue when Parkinson’s law really applies in the monolithic growth of the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>I say again that it will be the complete abrogation or the beginning of the abrogation and erosion of not only State <span class="highlight">powers</span> but also local government <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I will vote against this legislation not because I wish to deny to the people of Australia the right to decide on the issue involved but because I want to make it clear that I am not giving the seal of approval to the Government to bring in legislation, no matter how it is presented and for what motives it is presented, that will further diminish the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and responsibilities of the State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In an economy which is largely uncontrolled, where the Federal Government does not have the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of managementwhich obviously it ought to have- to regulate the economy as other countries do, the honourable senator suggests that in some way the Government is able to do simply what it likes without reference to the forces which in many ways control what the Government can do in this sphere as well as in others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the State Premiers but one attended that dinner and the following day an announcement was made that in principle- I think the words ‘in principle’ convey fairly accurately the sense of what had been arrived at- agreement had been reached on a proposal whereby the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of reference which the States have to refer matters to the Commonwealth would be clarified and that the Commonwealth would accept that there ought to be written into the Constitution a means by which the Commonwealth could refer <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the States for State action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On Tuesday last the Prime Minister told a Press conference in Canberra that the Attorneys-General of all the States had considered and approved the text of the Constitution alteration <span class="highlight">powers</span> Bill now before the Federal Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Together with my colleagues from the other States I agreed last year that the Services of our parliamentary draftsmen would be made available to assist in the preparation of a draft Bill relating to a constitutional amendment to provide for an interchange of <span class="highlight">powers</span> between the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall deal with each of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> in turn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He indicates that it is a matter of history that the States have been reluctant to refer matters to the Commonwealth, not withstanding that at the time the Constitution was established Alfred Deakin suggested that this was one means whereby the Constitution could be changed in form, as to the distribution of <span class="highlight">powers</span>, without the necessity of having a strict amendment of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must also be recognised that 1 1 of the 23 Acts which were passed pursuant to the reference of power were for wartime Commonwealth <span class="highlight">powers</span> in 1 942-43 or legislation which arose out of the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Powers</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although many of those matters have been clarified as a result of court decisions or court dicta in recent years, there has always been considerable doubt as to whether <span class="highlight">powers</span> could be referred for a limited time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One notes that the provisions of section 86 which confines the control and the collection of customs to the Commonwealth are expressly excluded so that the States will have some <span class="highlight">powers</span> in regard to the control and collection of customs if there is a designation of the excise area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-The Senate is debating a Bill entitled the Constitution Alteration (Inter-change of <span class="highlight">Powers</span>) Bill 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill aims, by its passage, to put to the people by way of referendum a proposal to add to section 108 of the Commonwealth Constitution, the effect of which, the Government said, would be to enable an interchange of <span class="highlight">powers</span> between Commonwealth and State governments, and vice versa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position appears to be that some support in principle for the idea of an interchange of <span class="highlight">powers</span> was made at the Constitutional Convention, but no reference of this Bill with its specific content has been made to the individual States and no attempt has been made to get the States to agree or disagree with the substantive content of the proposed new sections 108a or 108b. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one thing to think in principle that it would be a nice thing to have some interchange of <span class="highlight">powers</span> between the 2 spheres of government; it is a vastly different thing to look at the proposed mechanisms and to decide whether in the first place they would do what one wants and, secondly, whether one agrees with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me begin by saying that one thing is certain, namely, that if the Commonwealth is seeking this referendum by way of a new power it is seeking it for the purpose of increasing, and increasing substantially, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I acknowledge that the Government Whip,  Senator O’Byrne,  has acknowledged the fact that inherent in this legislation is a mechanism by which the Labor Party aims to gain more and more <span class="highlight">powers</span> for the central government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government will play a game of political pingpong, other than in Peking, with the States, whereby some days the States can have more <span class="highlight">powers</span> and other days <span class="highlight">powers</span> can be referred to Canberra, is a ridiculous idea in view of the fact that the Whitlam Government is pledged to destroy the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having established the fact that the Commonwealth Government’s motive is to centralise <span class="highlight">powers</span>, I do not want to get caught up in the legalistic jargon, with deference to the lawyers, regarding these Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply say that whilst uniform taxation persists and whilst the Commonwealth exerts its <span class="highlight">powers</span> of takeover and duress through the uniform taxation device and through section 96 of the Constitution, any idea of a game of political ping-pong is illusory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact is that before we look towards the interchange of <span class="highlight">powers</span> we should, first of all, agree to establish the sovereignties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real test of the bona fides of the Commonwealth Government with regard to the existence at any one time of <span class="highlight">powers</span> within the Commonwealth and <span class="highlight">powers</span> within the States is this: Is the Commonwealth Government willing to establish and to assert the sovereignty of the State governments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposing by these 2 instruments to take over State <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The device foreshadowed under this referendum in fact enables the States and the Commonwealth to transfer <span class="highlight">powers</span> from time to time- assuming it were a 2-way bid which I doubt very much- without reference to the people and, indeed, to entrench them for a long term- perhaps forever- in one sphere or another without the people specifically having said that they want those <span class="highlight">powers</span> so to lie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the sovereignty lies with the Commonwealth in terms of uniform taxation and in terms of section 96 of the Constitution, it will always be possible for the Commonwealth, by the duress of finance, to persuade the States to give up certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> for a defined or indefinite period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not looking merely at the de jure <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am here to talk about the people of Australia and the very important fact of their sovereign <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sovereignty of recall or the power of the people to decide where the power shall lie- with the Commonwealth or with the State- will not exist, because the States and the Commonwealth can, in particularities, determine the transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the Commonwealth, by its force of financial arms, can entrench those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But one thing is clear: The States and the State governments are ruman and they have a tendency to want to give up those <span class="highlight">powers</span> and responsibilities which at any point of time are unpopular- those that are too costly, those that are difficult and those that they feel they could let the other fellow have without losing votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course these <span class="highlight">powers</span> would not come back; they would move inexorably to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth knows that, by its money power and by its beckoning to take over unpopular things, it can take over more and more <span class="highlight">powers</span>- unpopular <span class="highlight">powers</span>, yes- until, as it does so from time to time, the States’ <span class="highlight">powers</span> become smaller and smaller and the States become in effect total vassals of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will you give us access to <span class="highlight">powers</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people never know the reasons why an option was made to exchange <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have heard that the Commonwealth Government has said that if it could have this interchange of <span class="highlight">powers</span> it would give the excise power to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that everything that the Whitlam Government has ever said on this matter has indicated that it wants to destroy State sovereignty, that it wants to take <span class="highlight">powers</span> from the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not one single sentence can be shown to me of any announcement by the Whitlam Government that it proposes to transfer <span class="highlight">powers</span> back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is interested in this matter as a demarcation dispute, to use an industrial term, then why does is not call a conference of the States on the whole range of governmental <span class="highlight">powers</span> and get a clear demarcation of functions so that we do not have this enormous difficulty that happens all the time of the Commonwealth intruding, by means of section 96 of the Constitution, into the affairs of the States, in terms of its erosion of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> and its takeover bids. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe there is only one way in which the people of Australia should resolve sovereignty as between the Commonwealth and the States and that is by, from time to time, giving specific <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was talk that there should have been some temporary giving up of <span class="highlight">powers</span> by the States to the Commonwealth recently in regard to incomes and prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently there is no alternative method of the Commonwealth giving <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the States under the existing Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has consistently adopted a policy of seeking to have transferred from the States to the Commonwealth certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> which would enable the Commonwealth to assume greater responsibilities in the development of our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister did say at that Convention that he proposed to have a referendum on the transference of <span class="highlight">powers</span> from the Commonwealth to the States and from the States to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that Opposition speakers have not referred to the fact that what is involved here includes the transference of <span class="highlight">powers</span> from the Commonwealth to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has on occasions expressed the view that there should be a transference of some of the <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable  senators must  surely recognise that this proposal seeks the concurrence of the States to transfer <span class="highlight">powers</span> from the States to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister is seeking to extend it, and I think I have indicated that in his desire to do this he will be recognised not only by the Australian people but ultimately by historians as a person who was prepared to go to the full extent of the democratic procedures to convince the Australian electorate to change the constitutional provisions relating to <span class="highlight">powers</span> between the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the Prime Minister ought to be recognised as a very courageous man for taking the steps that he has taken in a period of political difficulty, in this country, seeking to effect changes in the Constitution which after all, if agreed to, must still be determined by the Australian people and which would mean only a transference to the Commonwealth of <span class="highlight">powers</span> that already exist at the State level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it suggested that <span class="highlight">powers</span> which now exist at the State level are misused or that those <span class="highlight">powers</span> will be misused if held by the Commonwealth, or that the same public opinion that exists in the 6 States would suddenly disappear and not express itself if there should be any attempt to exercise wrongly those <span class="highlight">powers</span> at the Commonwealth level? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in the last 20 or 30 years the States have not exercised as they should the <span class="highlight">powers</span> they have held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear from the decision made yesterday by the Premier of New South Wales that he is either campaigning for his own political advantage and is not sincere in his desire to hand over to the Commonwealth the <span class="highlight">powers</span> to control prices and incomes or he genuinely holds that view and is fortified by the fact that his co.’league in Queensland will not be prepared to take the necessary step. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have listened with great interest to the debate which has ensued on this very important question of the transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> on a reciprocal basis between the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Gietzelt,  who is not present in the chamber to hear what I have to say in reply to him, talked about the States not using the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that they already enjoy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I asked him to enumerate the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that they had failed to exercise and he mentioned the matter of prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Constitution to enable an interchange of <span class="highlight">powers</span> between the Australian Parliament and the State parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us know just to what extent the States are prepared to go in the transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The States have not been overanxious to refer <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An honourable senator mentioned during the course of a speech today that over the years the States have referred <span class="highlight">powers</span> on about 25 occasions, and most of those referrals were made during the war years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I would like to know what <span class="highlight">powers</span> the Commonwealth is likely to transfer to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that it is likely to transfer any <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much has been said about  Mr Whitlam  ‘s statements and his conference with State Premiers, with the exception of the Premier of Queensland, on this question of an interchange of <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a former Premier of Queensland, I warn State governments not to concede <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Commonwealth merely to relieve themselves of the odium or the responsibility of implementing some power that they possess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the transfer of taxation <span class="highlight">powers</span> was a temporary measure originally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At an Australian Labor Party Conference held in Brisbane in 1957 I took up that attitude and read a paper in support of the restoration of taxation <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very easy to transfer <span class="highlight">powers</span> that you do not want to somebody else and then to cry about not having them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have stated repeatedly that the day the State governments gave away their taxing <span class="highlight">powers</span> they gave away their sovereignty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I say that while this Bill which seeks to amend the Constitution and to enable an interchange of <span class="highlight">powers</span> between the Australian Parliament and the State parliaments is indisputably attractive in its text, it is something that has to be examined very carefully and there must be unanimity between the States and the Commonwealth before a decision is made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You might have some <span class="highlight">powers</span> that you could give to us, and vice versa’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as a representative of Queensland I will be fighting to the bitter end to preserve the sovereignty, rights and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He knows as well as I do that there are no great <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the States would want from the Commonwealth, unless in respect of something that the Commonwealth wanted the States to implement for it and had to confer the power on the States for that reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I did not think that I would ever hear anything so paranoid as the contribution from  Senator Carrick  this afternoon in which he suggested that even when the Australian Government attempts to confer <span class="highlight">powers</span> upon the States it is attempting to crush them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present constitutional arrangement, as provided by section 5 1 placitum (xxxvii) is that the parliaments of the States may refer <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It suggests that there are certain spheres in which the Australian Parliament and the Australian Government might wish to confer <span class="highlight">powers</span> on the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can it be an invasion of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the States when they are left in complete control of the duration of any reference of power that they give to the Commonwealth? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This elaborates, expands and in every way increases the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the States in relation to any matters that they may refer to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is particularly shameful for lawyers on the opposite side of the chamber to suggest that this proposal detracts in any way from the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Up to now there has been considerable doubt among lawyers as to whether, when a State delegated or referred <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Australian Government, there was any power, to impose conditions or to include a power of revocation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was pleaded by the defendant company that the provisions of the regulations under the Act did not apply to the Richmond Air Force base because of the operation of section 52 (i), that is, that the Australian Government had exclusive <span class="highlight">powers</span> to make laws in respect to territory which had been acquired by the Commonwealth for public purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister has suggested, as I think all lawyers would concede, that this was an injustice which is wrought by this conflict of <span class="highlight">powers</span> between the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far from this being purely window dressing and far from suggesting that we merely want to make a pretence of conferring <span class="highlight">powers</span> on the States in order that they might see fit to confer <span class="highlight">powers</span> on the Australian Government with respect, for instance, to such matters as family law and defamation, I point to this offer of the Prime Minister which I respectfully suggest to honourable senators is an earnest of our sincerity and our genuineness in wanting to make this a 2 -way traffic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If carried, it will place the Commonwealth in the position where it will be able, when and where deemed expedient, to refer certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the States on terms and conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are offering to let the States have some <span class="highlight">powers</span>, and  Senator Carrick  says ‘<span class="highlight">powers</span> which are now within the exclusive power of the Australian Government’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the Australian Constitutional Convention broke up it set up various committees one of which was designed specifically to consider the fine print and the detail of this proposition for mutual interchange of <span class="highlight">powers</span> between the Australian Government and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When introducing this Constitution Alteration (Interchange of <span class="highlight">Powers</span>) Bill the AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Murphy)  in his second reading speech stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One point was that the draft did not guarantee a truly mutual reference of <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A second point made by  Mr Punch  was:  lt was suggested that consideration be given to amending the draft so that <span class="highlight">powers</span> designated by the Commonwealth Parliament might only be made exercisable by and available to all States, and so as not to permit a designation in favour of one or more States only, to the exclusion of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, it is in favour of the principle of the exchange of <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there are several unresolved questions on the operation of the existing provision for the States to refer <span class="highlight">powers</span> to this Parliament which have made them reluctant to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am talking about an interchange of <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this very informal manner an alleged agreement was made between the Prime Minister and those Premiers that in principle they agreed to a constitutional amendment by which the interchange of <span class="highlight">powers</span> between the Commonwealth and State parliaments would be facilitated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A case may be put in favour of an amendment of the Constitution so as to facilitate the reference of <span class="highlight">powers</span> by the States to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not holding this Convention to try to obtain more <span class="highlight">powers</span> from State Parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no real intention that there should be any transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> from this Parliament back to State Parliaments- and  Senator O’Byrne  does not believe there should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not concerned just with facilitating the transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> from State Parliaments to the Commonwealth Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the surface- which, I suppose is all that  Senator O’Byrne  has looked at, if that- it would appear that the Bill does intend to provide for the transfer of some <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth Parliament to State Parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the question is: What <span class="highlight">powers</span> might be transferred? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, what <span class="highlight">powers</span> are available in any meaningful way for transfer from this Parliament to State Parliaments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this Senate I asked a question of and received an answer from the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  on what he conceived might have been some of the <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we know, the vast majority of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth Parliament are known as concurrent <span class="highlight">powers</span>, that is <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are held by both the Commonwealth Parliament and State parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth Parliament that one can conceivably see as being the subject of transfer to State parliaments are those <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are known as exclusive <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister and the Attorney-General have indicated only one or two of the exclusive <span class="highlight">powers</span> as being the subject or the potential subject of transfer to State parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under section 52 of the Constitution the first of the Commonwealth exclusive <span class="highlight">powers</span> is the power to legislate with respect to the seat of government of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator James  McClelland would say: ‘Ah, here we have an excellent example of where there would be a transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to State parliaments because’- and he quoted the High Court decisions on the matter- ‘this has been a problem in respect of which the High Court has held that State parliaments cannot legislate in respect of Commonwealth property such as an Air Force base, a post office or a telephone booth.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did not have to transfer <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the State parliaments in order to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another one that is mentioned in section 52 refers to other matters declared by the Constitution to be within the exclusive <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government seriously intend under this Constitution Alteration Bill to transfer to State parliaments any <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to raising revenue of the nature of excise? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is clear that this proposal is not one in any serious or meaningful way for the interchange of <span class="highlight">powers</span> between the Commonwealth Parliament and the State parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only realistic purpose of this legislation is to try to induce the States more readily to transfer their <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Commonwealth Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The States have been very careful about transferring <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Commonwealth Parliament in the past, and I believe rightly so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, I believe that it is wrong in principle that changes in the Constitution relative to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth and the States should be determined by the State and Commonwealth Parliaments alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that State parliaments have been very sensitive to the feeling of their electorates in not readily making a transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Commonwealth Parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another thing about which they have been concerned is the doubts which have existed as to the extent of their power to refer, whether they would ever get back the <span class="highlight">powers</span> referred, whether they could be revoked and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a proposal to try to encourage the States more readily to transfer <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Commonwealth Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am deeply concerned that what the Commonwealth Government is really trying to do in this leglislation is to induce the States to transfer their <span class="highlight">powers</span> to it under some illusory suggestion that there would be a quid pro quo and that the Commonwealth would be transferring some <span class="highlight">powers</span> back to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a dangerous misreading of the Constitution and a dangerous misreading of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Parliament in relation to an amendment to the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite know that the simple associated question is whether the Commonwealth should be able to give back to the States certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> that it now holds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the legislation that has been carried in this Parliament in relation to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth over off-shore and submerged lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation may arise in which hundreds of Commonwealth Acts will have to be changed by specific Act of this Parliament if the Commonwealth is not able to grant <span class="highlight">powers</span> back to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be a far simpler process for the Commonwealth to be able to grant these <span class="highlight">powers</span> in what might be called domestic areas back to the States than to go through all the paraphernalia that will be necessary if it is found that the Commonwealth has all the power associated with areas off-shore from the low water mark. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were red herrings dragged across the path to fool the people of this country in respect of areas in which there would be no intention by either side to transfer <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be a complete misrepresentation of this legislation to suggest that there is any intention on the part of this Government in any way to take away from the States any <span class="highlight">powers</span> which they now have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He tried to suggest that the Commonwealth Government should in fact be able to tell the States what these <span class="highlight">powers</span> are that should be referred by the Commonwealth to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Prime Minister gave a very good example- this was touched upon by  Senator James  McClelland in the very good contribution that he made to this debate- during the course of the Constitutional Convention when he said in instancing these <span class="highlight">powers</span>: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Carrick  said that once these <span class="highlight">powers</span> are granted they will never be taken back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unfortunate that this debate has been used by honourable senators opposite in an attempt to create confusion in the minds of the Australian public on the basis that this is an action on the part of the Australian Government to in some way take away <span class="highlight">powers</span> from the States to the detriment of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Authority that are set out in clause 12 of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the Senate should try to protect the public against the inroads of <span class="highlight">powers</span> made by an allpowerful Canberra based Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Authority as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Authority are: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That gives much wider <span class="highlight">powers</span> still. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I was attempting not to cite all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that this Authority is likely to have if it gets under way,  Senator Young  draws attention to the fact that clause 12(1) (o) states that this Authority can acquire upon such terms as it thinks fit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no limit to its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 12 goes on to state that the Authority will have the ability to lend money, to underwrite issues of shares, to enter into partnerships, to give guarantees and to do anything incidental to any of its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not in accord at all with the accepted <span class="highlight">powers</span> that exist between the States and the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could discuss the microphone equipment which allows us to broadcast, or anything else, because these components are brought within the established <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Authority which is to be set up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was the writing into the charter of the then Commonwealth Bank- now, of course, the Reserve Bank- the duty to exercise its <span class="highlight">powers</span> in such a way as would best contribute to the stability of the currency, the maintenance of full employment and the economic prosperity of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Opposition senators know in their hearts that unquestionably any government in a democratic country like Australia, whether it is composed of members of the present Government or members of the present Opposition, could do many things if it had additional <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know when we study governments of the far right and governments of the far left that they have certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are used, legally or for that matter illegally, that we do not possess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I repeat, worthy or not as the tables on interest payments may be that have been advanced by the Opposition, the plain fact of the matter in regard to building materials is that while the Australian Government is not allowed to have the additional <span class="highlight">powers</span>, and while the States, if they do have the <span class="highlight">powers</span>, cannot control the blackmarketing across State borders involving bricks, timber and other commodities, the priorities of the building industry will be distorted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be recalled that the Australian Country Party objected to the establishment of what we saw as a new bureaucratic central planning body with <span class="highlight">powers</span> and influence of a kind that should reside only in the Government and the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister indicate whether the Government can use its administrative <span class="highlight">powers</span> on imports and exports to get a more responsible and reasonable attitude attuned to Australian conditions from these overseas monopolies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, in the unitary system in a country of British origins the judicial system is of very great importance, but in a federal system it is of unique importance inasmuch as there is entrusted to the judicial courts a determination of Constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> as between Federal and State parliaments and instrumentalities, and citizens’ rights dependent upon different laws have to be adjudicated upon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(h) and (i) of clause 19 of the Bill transcribe matters in the same terms of description as expressed in section 76 of the Constitution under which jurisdiction is not imperatively conferred upon the High Court, but under that section the Parliament has <span class="highlight">powers</span> to make laws conferring original jurisdiction on the High Court in any matter: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a system requires that the allocation of <span class="highlight">powers</span> shall be accomplished by law and it is for this reason that it depends upon the supremacy of the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, it was considered an essentail part of the federal system, as the writings in the ‘Federalist insist, that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of central and local governments alike should operate directly upon the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could have interminable arguments about a cause being outside the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of a particular jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government, by legislation and by the use of its export and corporation <span class="highlight">powers</span>, can lay down the elements of control of any industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gives to the Commonwealth Government total <span class="highlight">powers</span> over all stages of the development of petroleum and minerals and gives to the definition of both petroleum and minerals such a wide scope that virtually everything can be taken in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real intent is nationalisation and also unification, to get at the States, to draw the teeth of the States and to rob them of their <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government proposes in this Bill- and all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> are enumerated- that the taxpayer of this Commonwealth will perforce by means of taxation find the necessary monetary resources to go ahead and explore for minerals and petroleum offshore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister has certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the Pipeline Authority and he has certain other <span class="highlight">powers</span> whereby he has been interfering in the establishment of the Red cliffs project in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That whereas our constitutional parliamentary democracy was clearly developed as a Federation to preserve for all time to the Australian people their cherished right to live as free men and women, enjoying complete liberty of worship, assembly, speech, movement and the communication of knowledge and information, and whereas our existing Australian flag and our national anthem, ‘God Save The Queen’ are perpetual reminders of these hard-won freedoms and of the wise British principle of the division of power, so well reflected in our own Australian Constitution with its careful separation of <span class="highlight">powers</span> as between the Crown and Commonwealth Parliament, the Senate, the State parliaments, the Government-General and State Governors, and the independent courts of justice, and whereas all such rights, liberties, heritage, advancement and prosperity, etc., are of no avail if our armed forces are unprepared or incapable of repelling invasion of our shores or withstanding other military threats, so therefore must all these things be accorded the highest national concern and priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst  Mr Whitlam  ‘s appeal for a peaceful Indian Ocean is very creditable, it lacks reality because the only effective way of attempting to ensure a peaceful area is by having the great <span class="highlight">powers</span> equally balanced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Factors considered included international global developments affecting relations between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America, the strong interest of other major <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the avoidance of conflict, and various developments nearer to home involving countries in our neighbouring region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The world was dominated by the SinoSoviet dispute, and the possibilities of conflict between these two great <span class="highlight">powers</span> create uncertainties and conflicts throughout the world: In Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Indian subcontinent, the Indian Ocean, South-East Asia and the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These <span class="highlight">powers</span> will contest for influence in the region because its strategic importance and its great economic potential have not been diminished in any way as a result of the detente and dimantling of the Cold War structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These factors included international global developments affecting the relations between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America, the strong interest of other major <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the avoidance of conflict, and various developments nearer home in and between the countries within our own neighbouring region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is all right to say that we can keep out of these things but when super-<span class="highlight">powers</span> are confronting each other, fighting and using atomic weapons, we with the small nations of the world will become mere pawns in the game and we will not be masters of our own destiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We say that the sensible and the logical thing to do is to get these great superpowers together and to agree to an arms limitation in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been done between the super-<span class="highlight">powers</span> at every other level; they have met and have agreed to an arms limitation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not want the great <span class="highlight">powers</span> to come in with atomic weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not that it matters a great deal since the 2 super <span class="highlight">powers</span>- the United States and the Soviet Union- have enough to overkill one another many times over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The strategic arms limitation agreements have probably been cited more often than anything else as a breakthrough in relationships between the 2 super <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These agreements have been misunderstood, since both <span class="highlight">powers</span> already have sufficient nuclear weapons to destroy themselves and the world several times over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The assignment to which I have earlier referred was one whereby  Her  Majesty the Queen assigned to the Governor-General amongst other <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions  Her  Majesty’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions in respect of the appointment of Ambassadors Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary ‘to represent the interests of Australia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the better view in this case is that the office of Ambassador was held by the former senator from the moment  His Excellency  the Governor-General exercised pursuant to the assignment and section 2 of the Constitution those <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Queen relating to the appointment of Ambassadors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate, with the Opposition in the position in which it is at the moment, is exercising its <span class="highlight">powers</span> responsibly, and it represents a safeguard and a bulwark for people who are apprehensive about the excesses to which they think this Government can commit the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>And whereas our existing Australian Flag and our national anthem, ‘God Save The Queen’, are perpetual reminders of these hard-won freedoms and of the wise British principle of the division of power, so well reflected in our own Australian Constitution with its careful separation of <span class="highlight">powers</span> as between the Crown and Commonwealth Parliament, the Senate, the State Parliaments, the GovernorGeneral and State Governors, and the Independent Courts of Justice, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Section 184 refers to the High Court as the Court of Disputed Returns, and there are provisions about petitions and so on, what the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Court would be, inquiries by the Court, certain matters of illegal practices and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the honourable senator would refer to the various <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the High Court may exercise in considering any of these applications- I omitted to refer to the most important one of all- he will see that section 206 states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So there is this illusion enshrined in the opening sentence of the amendment- an amemdment which speaks of the Senate doing something in pursuance of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> under section 47. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now therefore, acting with the advice of the Executive Council of Australia, and in the exercise of all <span class="highlight">powers</span> Us thereto enabling, we do hereby assign to the GovernorGeneral of Australia, in addition to all other <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions previously assigned to the Governor-General, all our <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions in respect of the following matters: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This culminated on the evening of 2 April in an action taken in the Queensland Parliament, through the Governor of Queenslandvery properly under the <span class="highlight">powers</span> vested in him and in his Government under section 1 5 of the Commonwealth Constitution- to issue a writ for the coming Senate election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr President, you, very properly under section 21, studied  Senator Gair’s  letter, concluded that it was not a letter of resignation and concluded also that within your <span class="highlight">powers</span> of determination  Senator Gair  had not resigned and to that extent at least he was still a qualified senator; but that to the extent that events relating to his appointment may have disqualified him under sections 44 and 45 of the Constitution, you would refer this to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The court has similar <span class="highlight">powers</span> to those which may be exercised by it when determining a disputed election, and in addition, the power to declare that any person was not capable of being chosen on sitting as a  Senator or  member of the House, and to declare that a vacancy exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the 2 super <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the world today, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America, combine in space research I suppose honourable members opposite would say, if they were sitting in Congress, that  President  Nixon would be a communist as also would  Dr Kissinger  and everybody else there; therefore, they are not even to be talked about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When one looks at the particular <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Authority one finds them hair-raising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Senate has a major function it is that of protecting the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the States and not supporting legislation which diminishes those <span class="highlight">powers</span> or takes them away altogether. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the amendment on one major ground and that is in order to defend the rights of the States which, under our Constitution, to a very large degree have <span class="highlight">powers</span> and responsibilities in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But those of us who live in the Senate, who understand why the Senate was created by the founding fathers and who know the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which reside in the Senate, know that we are doing nothing unusual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then we have the claim made by the Prime Minister, as I understood him, that the State Attorneys-General had agreed to the text of the Constitution Alteration (Inter-change of <span class="highlight">Powers</span>) Bill and the contrary statement by the Attorney-General of Queensland in the Parliament of that State denying that an agreement was ever made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We in this chamber constitute a States House, and we are witnessing an immense threat to the sovereign <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the States of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refuse to agree that its rights or <span class="highlight">powers</span> are in any significant way circumscribed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet it is that precedent which the socialists, the left wingers and the superficial newspaper writers who presume to comment upon the propriety of the Senate ‘s exercise of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> in this matter take as their precedent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And when State interests are concerned, particularly in these days when State revenues are such a dominant issue, are senators to be thought to be merely an upper House with revisionary <span class="highlight">powers</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, it was appropriate that the Senate was given <span class="highlight">powers</span> completely incomparable with anything that was appropriate to the House of Lords. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Section 5 1 enumerates the general <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this Federal Parliament; section 52 enumerates the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which belong to this Parliament alone, its exclusive <span class="highlight">powers</span>; section 53 then devotes itself to the difference between the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate and of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is after an enumeration of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Parliament, the exclusive <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Parliament, and a definition of any distinction between the <span class="highlight">powers</span> belonging to this place and another place that we find section 57 brought into the constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the balance which came into the Constitution was that if the Senate, specially constructed with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> to which I have referred, deemed it proper in the exercise of its responsibility twice to reject a Bill after a 3 month interval, it put its judgment to the decision of the people just as the House of Representatives action in relation to the Bill is put to the judgment of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After discussing the prudence that would be required in the exercise of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the responsibility that they would command on the part of the Senate, Quick and Garran state: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does that not pose a challenge to this Senate in accordance with its constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> which we must keep in mind as the Government unfolds its program in the next week or two? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister noted the expressed willingness of the State premiers to co-operate with the Commonwealth and to refer <span class="highlight">powers</span> to it for the purpose of controlling inflation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for the election of 2 senators each for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory and that such senators have the same <span class="highlight">powers</span>, immunities and privileges as senators representing the States; that the first election of Territory senators be held at the same time as the next Senate elections in the several States or at the same time as the next general elections for members of the House of Representatives, if such is held before or in conjunction with the next Senate elections; that the term of the first Territory senators be from the date of their election until the eve of polling day for the ensuing general election for members of the House of Representatives; that after the first election for Territory senators, elections be held at the same time as the general elections for members of the House of Representatives; that after the first election of Territory senators, the terms of Territory senators be the period between each House of Representatives election; and for the Territory senators to be elected under the same system of proportional representation as that currently applicable to the election of senators representing the States, except in the case of a single casual vacancy when such vacancy shall be filled by the holding of a byelection adopting the procedures used for filling a single casual vacancy for a State senator, as far as may be applicable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second reason why I think the Senate is entitled to this material is that it affects the general <span class="highlight">powers</span>, the privileges and the assumed rights which the Senate has exercised over many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister inform the Parliament whether the Prices Justification Tribunal has sufficient <span class="highlight">powers</span> and authority to initiate an inquiry, as a matter of urgency, to cause such morally dishonest practices to cease forthwith? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How serious is that suggestion as far as the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and position of the Senate are concerned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill, which seeks to set up the Authority, clothes it with vast <span class="highlight">powers</span> in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this Authority extend not only to the ordinary Australian continental land mass, which is defined as extending to the outer limits of whatever sovereignty Australia has or may obtain over the continental shelf, but apply to what is in popular parlance both on-shore and off-shore deposits of energy resources and minerals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government seeks to clothe this Authority with the fullest conceivable <span class="highlight">powers</span> to operate in the mining industry, whether it be for energy resources or minerals generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Authority, having been clothed with all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that I have mentioned, may be thought to be adequately furnished for the purposes of operating as a corporation in the mining industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If its <span class="highlight">powers</span> stopped there we may not be so concerned about the Bill, although there would still necessarily be very great room for concern about where and how the Authority would operate and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Bill gives the Authority far wider <span class="highlight">powers</span> and a role of very much greater importance in the economy than that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the provisions of this Bill, the Petroleum and Minerals Authority, in carrying out these <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions, may declare any portion of the on-shore or off-shore areas an area for exploration for or for development of petroleum or minerals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Authority may then proceed to carry out all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions which it has under this Bill- they are vast- in respect of the particular exploration area declared by it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sort of control that is needed to prevent exploitation, wherever it occurs, is certainly within the province of the Australian Government through the proper process as through action by way of legislation, through taxation and through 100 other measures well within the legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I oppose the Bill basically because in its major context I believe that it is unnecessary and that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of control are already with us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand, the legislation envisages the establishment of a vertically integrated company with quite extraordinary and privileged <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When necessary it should be capable of arbitrating in disputes over the transmission interstate of petroleum products and could also have other regulatory <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been suggested that a commission could exercise all the necessary <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pipeline legislation overlaps much of the acquisition and many of the transportation <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second objective envisages an authority with huge and unfettered <span class="highlight">powers</span> acting from a totally privileged position to own the Australian petroleum and minerals industry; to compete from a totally and an absolutely unnecessarily, I believe, privileged position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate sent an Address to the Governor-General requesting  His Excellency  to exercise his constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> to submit the proposed amendments of the Constitution to the electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In talking of the dissolution of a Parliament and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the Governor-General had, he stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be wrong and it would be grave, because within the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the constitutional Head of State the discretions are vital and important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To put sanctions on its ability to communicate its messages to whomsoever in this community is to limit seriously the whole of the <span class="highlight">powers</span>, responsibilities and functions of the Senate, and I personally reject that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the commerce and export <span class="highlight">powers</span> the government of the day can and does decide what company shall establish itself in Australia, how much the company shall develop its resources each year, to what stages of refining or processing the company shall take those resources, how much in terms of tonnage shall be exported and what prices shall be received for the material exported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, following upon that the government of the day has complete <span class="highlight">powers</span> of taxation and charges levied upon the company at all levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Australian Government, without taking on any further <span class="highlight">powers</span> at all, has the power to say yes or no to a company that wishes to develop a particular mineral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I have is a brief for the Australian people and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> under our Constitution and existing law to preserve, conserve and develop the precious minerals we have in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let nobody say that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> do not exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a Bill to take from our State governments all their existing <span class="highlight">powers</span> over the resources in their States, all their vital need to obtain their finances from royalties, all their responsibilities for developing these things in an orchestration of State development and to give all those <span class="highlight">powers</span> to a central government in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that there is no need for more <span class="highlight">powers</span> if, indeed, the Commonwealth Government wants to control the exploitation of minerals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no need for more <span class="highlight">powers</span> if the Government wants to establish Australian equity inside the minerals industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the Government that comes forward and says: ‘Put us in, give us these <span class="highlight">powers</span> and you will get your minerals’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to Part II of the Bill which is headed ‘Establishment, Functions and <span class="highlight">Powers</span> of the Petroleum and Minerals Authority’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am certain that many people, particularly the leaders, in the various States will not be very happy about such <span class="highlight">powers</span> residing in the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This again illustrates the wide ranging <span class="highlight">powers</span> provided by this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further on in clause 12 we find that the Authority has these <span class="highlight">powers</span>: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we can see the great <span class="highlight">powers</span> that this Government would take unto itself if the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill became law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have a situation in South Australia that is causing very great concern because of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> given to the Minister under the Pipeline Authority Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unfair and it gives the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor)  enormous <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am disappointed that the Government should move with such dramatic force as it is moving in relation to this Bill without explaining to the Parliament and the people just what its policies are and what its intentions are in relation to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that this Bill will confer on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One must look quite deeply at the future development of the Australian Labor Party’s ideology before one confers the <span class="highlight">powers</span> defined here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to effect that protection we have to take some action, and the action proposed by the Government is to establish the Authority which in fact will be vested with <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the interests of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not subject to State law because its <span class="highlight">powers</span> flow from the Commonwealth Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be a denial of the Constitution to make the exercise of the Authority’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> subject to a State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other main purpose of the legislation is to give the Government adequate control <span class="highlight">powers</span> over non-bank financial institutions, in line with those that presently exist with regard to banks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed control <span class="highlight">powers</span> relate to asset ratios, directions regarding volume and direction of lending, and interest rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government considers that the availability of such control <span class="highlight">powers</span> over the non-bank financial sector is an essential requirement for a government charged with responsibilities for economic management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part IV of the Bill contains a description of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are sought for control of the business activities of financial corporations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has already been indicated, these <span class="highlight">powers</span> will be implemented, when necessary, by way of regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, clause 3 1 provides for the Reserve Bank to consult with associations or other bodies representing registered corporations to keep itself informed of their views in relation to the exercise by the Bank of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the legislation and of trends in activities of their members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be emphasised here that the Government proposes to consult appropriate advisory committees before making regulations to give effect to the control <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government understands the concern that has been expressed about the use which could be made of the wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> proposed to be taken in the Bill but it is most important to appreciate that the exercise of such <span class="highlight">powers</span> will be given effect only by bringing down regulations in the manner described. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such regulations will, of course, impose limits on the extent to which the control <span class="highlight">powers</span> will be subject to administrative discretion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fundamentally an umbrella type operation in which great overriding <span class="highlight">powers</span> are to be expressed in a form of varying kinds of regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First and foremost, throughout this Bill we have a provision that all <span class="highlight">powers</span> are to be exercised by the Minister for Minerals and Energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is generally regarded as an open question whether the Commonwealth may successfully claim that ‘rights’ or ‘<span class="highlight">powers</span>’ -as distinct from duties or obligations- accruing to Australia under international conventions will entitle it to legislate to give effect to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the power of delegation is a power properly to be exercised from time to time, an examination of the provisions of this legislation indicates that the type of delegation which is engaged in is such that any public servant might exercise <span class="highlight">powers</span> which ought properly, if they are to be exercised at all, be exercised by a Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was also a recommendation that there be in as many instances as are appropriate the insertion in the legislation of some objective criteria which the Designated Authority- in this particular legislation, the Minister- should observe in the exercise of his discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have mentioned the fact that there is a wide power of delegation contained in clause 10 by which the Minister may delegate his <span class="highlight">powers</span> to Commonwealth Public Service officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He referred, of course, to the discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that the Minister has wide discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore essential that, until adequate experience is gained in the administration of the legislation, discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span> be given to the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If those <span class="highlight">powers</span> had been given by the people we would not be facing this problem now because at that point this Tribunal would have been disbanded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this chamber ought to be exercised as <span class="highlight">powers</span> of other bodies ought to be exercised with proper regard to the considerations embedded in the statute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should point out that the Committee’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> of determination of the dates and times of broadcasting and televising of joint sittings proceedings are a little different from those laid down for proceedings of the separate Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the amendments to the original Bill enables the Commission to go even further in this regard by making available to the public general guidance information with respect to the carrying out of its functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another provision that will assist in this regard is the one that I have already mentioned enabling the Commission to give the public general guidance information concerning the carrying out of its functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also established that legal problems can arise when provisions that depend on that power are drafted so as to be inextricably mixed in their operation with provisions that depend on other <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But these provisions are given by clause 6 a separate operation in reliance upon other <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no tradition, as has been suggested, that the Senate will not use its constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>, whenever it considers it necessary or desirable to do so, in the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no limitations on the Senate in the use of its constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no limitations on the Senate in the use of its constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> except the limits self-imposed by discretion and reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Labor Party is represented in this Senate it will use its <span class="highlight">powers</span> and procedures without inhibition for the welfare of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there is to be a Parliament- which surely must have <span class="highlight">powers</span>- to which 5 Ministers will be appointed who, with the Administrator- who is like a governor- will act only in an advisory capacity, how can the Parliament legislate, administer and rule the people who have elected it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Officers of Australian Government departments with great consistency gave evidence- we were assured in most cases that their Ministers had seen their submissions- advocating an elected House of Assembly for the Territory, adding with emphasis, ‘But we should not give any of our <span class="highlight">powers</span> away. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under section 49 of the Constitution one of the undoubted <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate (and of the House of Representatives) is the power to summon witnesses to appear before it to give evidence and produce documents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result the Commonwealth Bank was strengthened and given greater <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To put it simply and in a nutshell, the Bill will provide for the Government to have direct control and <span class="highlight">powers</span> over the activities of the nonbank financial institutions- an essential requirement for any government charged with the responsibility of economic management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also question whether the Government needs the <span class="highlight">powers</span> contained in this Bill to control the inflation which we are experiencing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are in the Bill certainly would be counter-productive in terms of the normal social and economic objectives of Australian governments and in some circumstances could be disastrous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pattern that we have seen emerge in the introduction of this legislation is the Government suggesting that it requires <span class="highlight">powers</span> but giving assurances that they will not necessarily be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The assurance that <span class="highlight">powers</span> are required but will not necessarily be used is one that I accept only with reservations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the Government has asked for these <span class="highlight">powers</span> and wishes to use controls in an attempt to achieve the objectives of tight credit and low interest rates in a highly inflationary situation could result in investors rapidly moving their funds out of those financial intermediaries which are subject to direct controls into other financial assets, and this could be very disastrous in the present situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we are hearing that <span class="highlight">powers</span> may not necessarily be used, Ministers have varying ideas on what interest rates should apply at the present time and from time to time Ministers make irresponsible statements which cause a rapid deterioration in the money market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the problems which face us in the present economic climate, and I question some of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> provided in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill contains <span class="highlight">powers</span> that give control over the volume and direction of lending and over asset ratios and also <span class="highlight">powers</span> with which to control interest rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">powers</span>, taken as a conglomerate, give the Government absolute control over the existing system in our economy, and I question the outcome of the use of some of these <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had thought that he might draw attention to the fact that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> for controlling the direction of lending could be directed towards an institution such as the Australian Industry Development Corporation and its objectives with regard to Australian ownership of some of our resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also draw attention to the clause which relates to asset ratios, because by linking clauses 13 and 14 we see the effect which the Government could achieve by using the <span class="highlight">powers</span> contained in this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that there are direct controls on interest rates, as well as the other 2 <span class="highlight">powers</span> I have mentioned, means that we have not a satisfactory method of dealing with inflation but a control which results in the institutions themselves having no means of making commercial decisions with regard to their business undertakings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To their credit Senators Cotton and Guilfoyle have not suggested that the Government does not in fact need some such <span class="highlight">powers</span> as it is seeking although, as they are entitled as responsible oppositionists, they have certain reservations about the details of what we are seeking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Reserve Bank shall, from time to time as it considers desirable, consult associations or other bodies representing registered corporations with the object of keeping itself informed of their views in relation to the exercise by the Reserve Bank of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this Act and the regulations and in relation to trends in activities of their members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic objectives of the Bill are to provide the means of obtaining additional basic information about the institutions which are referred to in the Bill and also to give the Australian Government adequate’ control <span class="highlight">powers</span> over what we know as the non-bank financial institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These control <span class="highlight">powers</span>, it is suggested, will be in line with those that presently exist in regard to banks and they are designed to assist the Government in the effective overall management of the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of this I think that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are sought under the Bill must largely be measured in terms of their scope and not by anything that may have been expressed by the Government or be in its mind to meet its present goals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill contains a number of points of interest, one of which is that it is described as an enabling Bill, that is, a Bill which will enable lesiglative <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be conferred upon the Executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Financial Corporations Bill gives considerable <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the central Government through the Reserve Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The exercise of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are outlined in the Financial Corporations Bill could cut right across the responsibility imposed upon those people who are known as directors and who manage the societies under State law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has expressed a view that it is desirable for the government of the day to have <span class="highlight">powers</span> in this field and to have <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to financial institutions in the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This measure- the Financial Corporations Bill- which the Senate is now debating is one of very great significance and one which confers profound <span class="highlight">powers</span> upon the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to support those amendments, to support the general principle of an extension of <span class="highlight">powers</span> over the non-banking area and to express some qualifications in terms of the likely consequences of those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The governments of the last 2 decades have seen fit, under central banking <span class="highlight">powers</span>, to put certain restrictions on the trading banking system which did not apply until now to those who are outside the orthodoxy of banking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides <span class="highlight">powers</span> which will enable direct and arbitrary action by future governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator said that a significant safeguard against the abuse of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the Bill would be the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These of course are very profound <span class="highlight">powers</span>, far and away beyond those that  Senator James  McClelland indicated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that does not disguise the fact that the Bill itself entrenches certain latent <span class="highlight">powers</span> of great magnitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am bound to point out to the Senate that this legislation does provide <span class="highlight">powers</span> which, if so used, could reach those goals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Depending how lightly or how heavily a government might use those <span class="highlight">powers</span>, good or bad results can be induced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am bound to say that inherent in this Bill are sufficient <span class="highlight">powers</span> so to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same argument is inherent in the idea that in the non-bank area one can use discriminatory interest rates or <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the banking legislation that we are now considering in order to reduce the flow of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a pretty healthy commendation of a group of companies which now will come under the <span class="highlight">powers</span> contained in this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great danger of fixing figures in this way- of including some companies and excluding others- is that in the weeks and months ahead we will see all sorts of manoeuvres being made in order to evade the <span class="highlight">powers</span> provided under this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, if a company has assets of $ 1.5m today it would be very easy to split up that company into 2 companies, each with assets of $750,000, so that they would not be subject to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> provided under this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me to be absolutely necessary that we should have these <span class="highlight">powers</span> fully extended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn to the Australia Labor Party’s platform and see that it has discharged the main planks which I have read out, and I worry that if the Party or its successors should seek to implement those planks the <span class="highlight">powers</span> lie within the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We look towards the bona fides of the Treasurer and his Government in pursuing a moderate line in the use of these <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose it would be easy to share the concern of  Senator Carrick  about the Australian Labor Party perhaps being able to implement its ideological views through the <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred on the Government by this Bill and about the Bill perhaps not having any immediate effect on the inflationary scene which is bedevilling Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason the Government is not defining precisely the manner in which the <span class="highlight">powers</span> written into this legislation will be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite possibly it could be legitimately said that in the course of exercising those <span class="highlight">powers</span> anti-inflationary measures would become effective, more by default than by design, but it would be wrong to suggest that this legislation would be used for that purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bank the same <span class="highlight">powers</span> over the financial corporations covered by the Bill as the Reserve Bank has over trading banks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also important to realise that although there are certain arbitrary <span class="highlight">powers</span> which a governmentwhether it be this Government or any future government-may use, and I think this was the point that  Senator Hall  was making also, those arbitrary <span class="highlight">powers</span> should not be abused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is really the key to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the Government would want the Reserve Bank to have in respect of these institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure the Senate that there is no intention on the part of the Government to abuse in any way the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which would flow to the Reserve Bank from the passage of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that under this legislation the Government would have fairly wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> of regulation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, handicapped as it is by lack of adequate constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> to combat inflation, is nevertheless determined to continue the fight with all vigour, with the aid of the instruments at its disposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 2 fields in particular where the Tribunal can make a larger contribution if it is given the necessary <span class="highlight">powers</span> and resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have decided to give the Tribunal the necessary <span class="highlight">powers</span> and resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Tribunal will employ these additional <span class="highlight">powers</span>, particularly, but not exclusively, in actively inquiring into and reporting upon both retail prices and the prices of imported goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is simply a prohibition that the Bank shall not use its <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the regulations to determine the provision of finance for particular purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, instead of the wholesale permissive discrimination that would be allowed under subclauses (4) and (5) of the Government’s Bill, as I read the Opposition amendment it is a straightout prohibition against the Bank using its <span class="highlight">powers</span> to determine finance for a particular person or to prohibit finance for a particular person, and a prohibition against the Bank requiring finance by a corporation outside its ordinary business or prohibiting finance inside its ordinary business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is possible that it contains very great abuses if it is not carefully watched and if it is too highly specific in its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there is a good deal of confusion, among Government senators certainly, in respect of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee under this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only would there be limitations upon the Regulations and Ordinances Committee but also there could well be considerable limitations on the power of this Parliament to deal with the exercise of <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the fact of the matter is that most of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are to be given to the Reserve Bank of Australia or to the Government under this Bill will be exercised in the form of determinations and not by way of regulation at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the exercise of <span class="highlight">powers</span> will not be subject to the scrutiny of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee and not subject to the scrutiny of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-As one who has served on the Regulations and Ordinances Committee for almost 25 years and for almost 20 years as  chairman,  and as one who has a great regard for the Committee, I feel that where there is a division of opinion or an element of doubt as to whether the Committee has power to act in these matters we should make sure that the legislation which goes through is watertight, because if we presume that the Committee has <span class="highlight">powers</span> and ultimately a situation arises and we find that it does not have those <span class="highlight">powers</span> this Senate will be at fault for letting the legislation go through on a risky basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sub-section 10(2) of the Reserve Bank Act 1959-1973 applies in relation to the exercise of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Reserve Bank under this Act and the regulations in like manner as it applies in relation to the exercise of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Reserve Bank under the Reserve Bank Act 1959-1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without limiting the generality of paragraph 8 (c) of the Reserve Bank Act 1959-1973, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred on the Reserve Bank by that paragraph are exercisable in relation to registered corporations being building societies.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We regard the procedure of an affirmative resolution as vital, in view of the sweeping <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the legislation to make regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I share some of the concern about what this Government might do with the various <span class="highlight">powers</span> it has at its disposal in the Australian community but that does not mean that we can make its approach to legislation unworkable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The series of events leading up to the confrontation in Queensland resulting in the Minister requiring more <span class="highlight">powers</span> is well documented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I wish to make is that the Minister already has <span class="highlight">powers</span> that he seeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One wonders how a dedicated and unscrupulous Minister- if such a person existed- might care to use these <span class="highlight">powers</span> to impose discipline of an absolutely arbitrary kind on the funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present law is, however, uncertain regarding the Minister’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> in cases where a registered organisation presents a ‘package’ application for a variation in medical or hospital benefits and contribution rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Baume ‘s speech illustrates, in a most cogent manner, the need to confine ourselves to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that have been given to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No such power was given to this Parliament in the Constitution, and I protest that $ 1 5.75m that we have exacted from the taxpayers pursuant to our taxing <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be illegally appropriated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this occasion I assert that constitutional law coincides with commonsense to require that this project should be considered as beyond our <span class="highlight">powers</span> and, on the evidence submitted to us, not justified from either the point of view of economics or social improvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation extended certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the  Chairman  and Vice-Chairman of the Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings and to the Committee as a whole in regard to televising the sitting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee has considered the use of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> very carefully. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the Committee became aware of the legislation it has met on several occasions to consider the manner in which use should be made of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred by the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We understand that the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  has claimed that the present law is uncertain regarding the Minister’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> in cases where a registered organisation presents as an application a package plan for a variation in medical or hospital benefits or contribution rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I presume it is his interpretation that the Minister’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> are limited to acceptance or rejection in toto of the application. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is important that we recognise its 2 purposes: First, the perpetuation of Labor in office, and secondly, the destruction of State <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Great persuasive <span class="highlight">powers</span> had to be brought into play. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government proposes that there should be 64 senators, and that all of those senators should have full voting <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The failure of Federal governments to achieve State <span class="highlight">powers</span> by numerous referenda bear witness to that contention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will be elected on different terms and at different times but with <span class="highlight">powers</span> equal to any other bona fide senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should provide in advance for all conceivable Federal contingencies, strengthen the Federal Government and trust the Federal Parliament to use its <span class="highlight">powers</span> wisely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just think what the position would be like today if this incompetent, disorganised government, now in public disarray with half a dozen Treasurers and would-be Treasurers, had been given the <span class="highlight">powers</span> for which it asked in these referenda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would not just provide territorial representation in the Senate, as envisaged by section 122 of the Constitution; it would also provide territorial senators who would have full voting <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, whilst it is proposed that representatives of Territories in the Senate should have full voting <span class="highlight">powers</span> they would differ in important respects from other senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During our time in government Territory representatives in the House of Representatives gained full voting <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When, after the Second World War, the social service amendments were made to the Constitution, further <span class="highlight">powers</span> in respect of health, hospitals, medical benefits, etc., were conferred upon the Commonwealth Government, but not so as to authorise any form of civil conscription. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Time makes very severe constraints in this respect, but in terms of the medical profession the Prime Minister and his supporters intend to use the weight of the Commonwealth’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> to interpose themselves in every consultation between a doctor and a patient, and it is a weight that can barely be resisted by the people who do not have great organisations behind them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in no small measure due to the quadrupling of oil prices that a threat is posed to the economic viability and foreign exchange reserves of some of the world’s major industrial <span class="highlight">powers</span>, which have complacently relied on unlimited cheap oil imports, and have ignored research and development of alternative energy sources, such as natural gas, coal, and ultimately uranium and solar energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill vests in the Petroleum and Minerals Authority the same functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span>, in relation to these other minerals, as it does in relation to petroleum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation in relation to the States onshore minerals stands on the basic constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Parliament to regulate overseas trade and interstate trade, and also, at appropriate times, the general <span class="highlight">powers</span> for the defence of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By bludgeoning through the Parliament such wide ranging <span class="highlight">powers</span>, without consultation with the State governments or the industry, in a Bill with such wide ramifications the Government is making a sham of the democratic process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Never have we seen such far-reaching <span class="highlight">powers</span> being given to a Minister or such wide-ranging all-embracing <span class="highlight">powers</span> being given to an authority as exists in this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely such <span class="highlight">powers</span> and such highly contentious issues deserve a great deal more explanation from this Government than we have had up to date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no need for a further extension of power, particularly to a government which so clearly has abused and misused so many of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are available to it at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sorry that I cannot pursue further the extraordinary <span class="highlight">powers</span> which will be given to this Authority but I am glad that they have been covered by speakers earlier in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will have unlimited <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to the terms under which it can employ staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill further asserts <span class="highlight">powers</span> that conflict with the rights and the laws of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It asserts <span class="highlight">powers</span> to take over mineral projects and unrestrained discrimination in its favour against private mines found and developed by high risk private capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Authority is not subject to State law because its <span class="highlight">powers</span> flow from the Constitution and it would be a denial of the Constitution to make the exercise of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> subject to a State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As State mining laws do not apply it is necessary to give the Authority alternative means of gaining access to areas for its activities; hence the declaration provisions in Part VI of the Bill and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of entry in clauses 13 and 14. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much has been made of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Authority in clause 12. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These provisions simply reflect those <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the articles of association of any oil or mining company would contain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is, of course, nonsense as the <span class="highlight">powers</span> to lend moneys, underwrite shares and give guarantees will clearly indicate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is ridiculous to suggest that these <span class="highlight">powers</span> are capable, in practical terms, of being used to nationalise or socialise any more than the comparable provisions in the articles of association of a company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the establishment of the Department of Minerals and Energy and with the influence of Rex Connor all export contracts were scrutinised using <span class="highlight">powers</span> available to the Australian Government and the industry is now returning to sanity and there are now long term prospects for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this Bill, if it passes this Joint Sitting and the High Court, will give a government instrumentality enormous <span class="highlight">powers</span> possessed by no other instrumentality, public or private. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill seeks to give the Authority sweeping <span class="highlight">powers</span> of entry and occupation, irrespective of other title to the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Minister seeks even further <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such an authority with such extraordinary and privileged <span class="highlight">powers</span> could be justified only if in fact the concern of the Government, the establisher of this Authority, was not control of those industries but the ownership of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> for satisfactory and suitable control as they stand today are well within the province of the Government without introducing extraordinary measures such as those which are envisaged in connection with this Authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under our out-of-date for the 1970s form of government, with the States warring with the Australian Government, a hostile Senate with extraordinary <span class="highlight">powers</span> able to frustrate the will of the popularly elected House of Representatives, members of the Opposition have plenty of opportunities to practice this obstructionism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for the setting up of an Authority which, in short, has excessive and unreasonable <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the hearings of the Committee it was clear to me, as it was to other members of the Committee, that there was a lot of misunderstanding and conjecture regarding the meaning of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred by particular provisions in the Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were not within the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the legislation provided for the AIDC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first consists of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> contained in sections 45 to 50 dealing with contracts, arrangements and understandings in restraint of trade or commerce, monopolisation, exclusive dealing, resale price maintenance and mergers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party and the Australian Country Party have as a fundamental part of our ideology that there are State governments and parliaments with legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> which allow them to make laws which relate to matters very close to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly it has developed and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which people thought were doubtful when it was originally introduced have now been shown to be greater and consequently stronger legislation can be introduced at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has plenty of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to advise people about their rights, but as I read the Bill the Commission has not the function of receiving and dealing with individual complaints. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that there ought to be a reference of <span class="highlight">powers</span> by the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be that the results of further discussions between the Commonwealth and the States will lead to some useful reference of <span class="highlight">powers</span> where such a course is obviously necessary because of the complexity of schemes which cover more than one State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third matter which I say is good reason for reconsideration of the problem is the confusion of enforcement which is contemplated under this scheme and under the existing <span class="highlight">powers</span> and existing organisations of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has gone beyond those <span class="highlight">powers</span> and desirable objectives in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Commissioner of Trade Practices has urged the need for a resolution of the conflict and it is quite obvious that the administration is not being encouraged by  Senator Murphy  to employ the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the present legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Though natural enough and, in view of the unions’ immense bargaining and intimidatory <span class="highlight">powers</span>, almost inevitable, this has bedevilled, and is continuing to bedevil, the country’s economic stability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General may give directions to the Commission in connexion with the performance of its functions or the exercise of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this Act other than its functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> under Part VII, and the Commissioner shall comply with any directions so given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clauses which the Committee has just accepted relate to various matters concerning the Commission, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission, its procedures, representation of the public, delegations, the staff of the Commission and its functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 29 gives to the AttorneyGeneral certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> with respect to the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General may give directions to the Commission in connexion with the performance of its functions or the exercise of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this Act other than its functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> under Part VII, and the Commission shall comply with any directions so given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ought not to have the connection which is involved in the <span class="highlight">powers</span> given to the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite properly, even on the view which the Attorney-General takes as to what should be the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that he has over the Commission, he does not seek to include <span class="highlight">powers</span> of that character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when one considers the other <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission, I invite consideration to be given to the functions of the Commission which are set out in clause 28. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one considers clauses 155 and 156 of the Bill, to which we will give consideration in due course, which refer to the transitional provisions, one finds that enormous <span class="highlight">powers</span> are given to the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">powers</span> of that character are to be contained in the legislation they ought to be circumscribed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he feels that these <span class="highlight">powers</span> are too wide I accept his suggestion that he take this clause away and redraft it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General may give directions to the Commission in connexion with the performance of its functions or the exercise of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this Act - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It continues: other than its functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> under Pan VII <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is said by the Attorney-General that the functions of the Commission and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> under Part VII are exempt from his direction, and so they are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General may give directions to the Commission in connection with the performance of its functions or the exercise of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this Act other than its functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> under Part VII, and the Commission shall comply with any directions so given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said, and those who advise me also take the view, that these provisions are clearly in connection with the functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> under Part VII. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not let this be dealt with on a difference of viewpoint between  Senator Wright  or  Senator Greenwood  on one side and myself on the other, although I am quite confident that clauses 22 and 23 are in connectionand that is all they are- with the functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> under Part VII. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From reading the Income Tax Assessment Act it is clear that the Minister has not got any <span class="highlight">powers</span> to tell the Commissioner of Taxation how he shall exercise his functions, and nor should the Minister have any power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst appreciating, as we would see the position, some restraint by the Attorney-General upon the wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> which we think the Bill contains, we say that there is a wider problem and a wider proposition involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clauses 19 and 20 refer to <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that throughout the legislation there are <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission which should be exercised independent of ministerial direction or discretion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clauses 19 and 20 and even 18 provide <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Commission- I am sure there are others- that would equally come within the area that the Attorney-General has offered to exclude from his ministerial direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is a quasi judicial function which is provided in Part VII and other provisions in the Bill which are in aid of the execution of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> under Part VII. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">powers</span>, not just those in Part VII, aid the functions of the Commission under Part VII. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All those <span class="highlight">powers</span> are excluded from this provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 28 sets out5 <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are essentially of an administrative character which could be said to be functions which an ordinary government department would normally carry out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, clause 29 is provided essentially in relation to those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He must have the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of a Permanent Head. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Opposition is not concerning itself with any of that and I suppose rightly so because one expects that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are given, like all other <span class="highlight">powers</span>, will be exercised bona fide and for the purposes for which they are given with due regard for the rights of persons affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It applies to all of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Parliament afterwards finds cause to complain about the very wide interpretation that has been given to <span class="highlight">powers</span>, Parliament has only itself to blame because it never corrected the error when the legislation was going through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No consideration has been given to the provision contained in clause 100 relating to resale price maintenance applications; and as I recall the debate, no mention has been made of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the Commission will have under clauses 149, 155 and 156 of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All those <span class="highlight">powers</span> are tremendously wide, dealing as they do with the power of the Commission to acquire documents and to require people to give evidence before the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Powers</span> which can be exercised by the Executive, <span class="highlight">powers</span> exercised by the great corporations, whether they be of capital or of labour, diminish the standing of the individual, and we ought to be concerned to preserve as far as possible his integrity and independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that viewpoint would assist in the better maintenance of our system of parliamentary democracy and supervision over those who are exercising quite important administrative <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, the regulation making <span class="highlight">powers</span> are subject to the supervision of both Houses of this Parliament The Parliament’s power to disallow a regulation would be readily used if in some case it was thought that a regulation had been made inappropriately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘God Save The Queen’, are perpetual reminders of these hard-won freedoms and of the wise British principle of the division of power, so well reflected in our own Australian Constitution with its careful separation of <span class="highlight">powers</span> as between the Crown and Commonwealth Parliament, the Senate, the State Parliaments, the GovernorGeneral and State Governors, and the Independent Courts of Justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And whereas our existing Australian Flag and our national anthem, ‘God Save The Queen,’ are perpetual reminders of these hard-won freedoms and of the wise British principle of the division of power, so well reflected in our own Australian Constitution with its careful separation of <span class="highlight">powers</span> as between the Crown and Commonwealth Parliament, the Senate, the State parliaments, the GovernorGeneral and State Governors, and the independent Courts of Justice, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-There is no doubt that there are legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> over foreign corporations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to repeat very briefly the call that I made on Tuesday for a reference of <span class="highlight">powers</span> in this area from the States to the Australian Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see tremendous advantages in a reference of <span class="highlight">powers</span> which I believe would mean that there is no validity whatsoever in the Opposition criticism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, the advantage of a reference of <span class="highlight">powers</span> would be to obviate any legal constitutional difficulties which, as has been indicated, may arise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is the obligation of State governments to offer a lead in this respect and offer the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">powers</span> that would produce the beneficial results I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Referring, finally, to the points made by  Senator Everett  about the reference of <span class="highlight">powers</span> from the States to the Commonwealth, I would like the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  to advise us whether a reference of <span class="highlight">powers</span> has been sought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised that although the Tasmanian Parliament had referred <span class="highlight">powers</span> to deal with this subject matter- they were used by this Parliament- that reference has lapsed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 155 relates to the compulsory <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission to obtain information, documents and evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In considering the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which should be vested in such a body it is useful to point to another of the lessons in this case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We suggest, with respect, that in the light of the experience of everybody who has had anything to do with this field of affairs, the Opposition is trying to render the Commission and its <span class="highlight">powers</span> nugatory by saying that the legislation will be there but in practice it will be unworkable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ater all it is comparable to inviting the Commissioner of Taxation, who has enormous <span class="highlight">powers</span>, to make his files and records available in criminal proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should we create a new body called the Trade Practices Commission, give it the wide ranging compulsory <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are contained in this legislation and allow them to be used in the way in which it is alleged they can be used as the Bill stands at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He says that despite the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which this Bill gives him, he does not have and never really has had any intention of using these <span class="highlight">powers</span> to coerce State governments and local authorities in respect of urban local roads, rural local roads, development roads, beef roads and minor traffic engineering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is what the policy is, why does the Minister not circulate his own amendments to his own Bill and put in the Bill the <span class="highlight">powers</span> he wants instead of adopting these sloppy methods of drafting Bills which are typical of the sort of inefficiencies that we are constantly experiencing at the hands of this Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is seeking to arrogate to itself all these vast <span class="highlight">powers</span> and then turns around and tries to mollify the people and to hoodwink them by saying: ‘We do not intend to use these <span class="highlight">powers</span>, you know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just give us these <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that our willingness, like that of most people in this country, to trust Ministers of this Government with vast <span class="highlight">powers</span> is fast running out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Durack  has referred to all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister in clause 4(1). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>And whereas our existing Australian Flag and our national anthem, ‘God Save The Queen’, are perpetual reminders of these hard-won freedoms and of the wise British principle of the division of power, so well reflected in our own Australian Constitution with its careful separation of <span class="highlight">powers</span> as between the Crown and Commonwealth Parliament, the Senate, the State Parliaments, the GovernorGeneral and State Governors, and the Independent Courts of Justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  <span class="highlight">powers</span> under sub-clause (2) are statutory and would have to be exercised bona fide for the purposes of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised that even if clause 4(1) and clause 1 1 were omitted from the Bill there might still be occasions when it would be necessary for the Treasurer to invoke the <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred under paragraph (c) to obtain information from the States in order that he could determine the extent to which financial assistance was to be provided for them under clause 5(1). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that that is an unnecessary intrusion into the States’ <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions in these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1) A Minister referred to in section 4 may, either generally or otherwise as provided by the instrument or delegation, by writing under his hand, delegate to an officer of the Australian Public Service any of his <span class="highlight">powers</span> under that section. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A delegate of a Minister, is, in the exercise of his <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this Act, subject to the directions of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this clause is to give to the Minister for Transport power to delegate to an officer of the Australian Public Service any of his <span class="highlight">powers</span> under clause 4 which relates to approving programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, the Air Navigation Act provides that a Minister may delegate <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to international airports, the cancellation or suspension of a licence, approval of nonscheduled flights on foreign carriers and of the use of defence aerodromes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition there are many other <span class="highlight">powers</span> to delegate in the regulations made pursuant to the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that on 3 occasions the transitional <span class="highlight">powers</span> provided in this Bill have been granted by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Pensioners transport be made free within the Federation where the Government has constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-3-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, as I have said, we believe that the stand we took was justified and the flow of further centralist <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Commonwealth Government, as these Bills originally provided, has been arrested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst we are pleased about the amendments, it is still a very small measure of alteration to the enormous <span class="highlight">powers</span> that have been freshly taken on behalf of the Commonwealth in regard to overseeing all the expenditure of road funds by State authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that this clause as originally drafted was a logical approach to the question of future growth centres and the delegation of the concurrent <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot say that the Opposition is happy about the extended <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Federal Minister in relation to the declaration of other than national highways, that is, the declaraton of export or major commercial roads. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the High Court will presumably keep the Minister in line if he transgresses the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth in these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion it is vital not to reduce the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that have been conferred on our committees up to the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#debate-80">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that Pensioners transport be made free within the Federation where the Government has constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of this Government do not go around crawling to the big <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The European <span class="highlight">powers</span> make it clear that they have no intention of doing this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, whether willingly or unwillingly, the Government is undermining our relations with the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> and above all their confidence in us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was another proceeding against  Mr Alexandrov  of the Soviet Embassy who, with those remarkable psychic <span class="highlight">powers</span> which I had thought had been generally attributed to the more oriental communists but apparently are also possessed by communists from Russia, or by some sort of thought control, was able to retain  Mr Ermolenko  in custody while  Mr Ermolenko  was in Perth and  Mr Alexandrov  was in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The argument is used- I think there is a certain amount of justification for it- that the Soviet Union needed to take some steps to protect itself by entering into some sort of treaty with the nazis because the Western <span class="highlight">powers</span> at that time had refused to co-operate with it and had rebuffed its efforts to organise a common front against the then menace of the Axis <span class="highlight">powers</span>- nazi Germany and fascist Italy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the circumstances which face us, in the curcumstances which bring about the necessity of negotiation and co-operation for world peace- and I know that well meaning, honest people will disagree with me on this- I submit that one of the essentials is to recognise the sovereignty of all of the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> over those areas where they can make some strong de facto claim for such sovereignty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next thing that honourable senators must realise is that we know we are living in a world of detente- that is to say, we are living at a time of pause in the relationships and competition between the 2 great superpowers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We may be indeed the beneficiaries of detente between the 2 great <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government by its decision greatly undermined the work which already had been done by the Western <span class="highlight">powers</span>, and this is a very important point for the Senate to remember. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The work of obtaining more freedom in international arrangements and understandings which had been achieved by the Western <span class="highlight">powers</span> has been greatly undermined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the future it will make it more difficult for the Western <span class="highlight">powers</span> to continue to work to achieve the freedom and independence of the smaller states. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The object of the Act and the wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> given under it were, of course, at that time dictated very much by the strategic character of uranium as to its use in the production of atomic weapons and the great concern which was held at that time in respect of that subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, the Commonwealth Government has adequate <span class="highlight">powers</span> in regard to the national interest as far as mining, including the mining of uranium, is concerned under its export control <span class="highlight">powers</span> generally and under regulations that have been made under those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">powers</span> are quite adequate and they relate specifically to uranium in the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act to which I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason given by the Government as to why it wants these <span class="highlight">powers</span> is to plan a coherent and rational policy for the development of Australia’s uranium resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, there are these overall <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the Commonwealth Government has to ensure that it is able to carry out what are conceived to be national policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">powers</span> were held to be legally valid- we are not concerned with that here- they would override completely all existing rights and titles which have been acquired by persons or companies under State or Territory laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we have frequently debated the <span class="highlight">powers</span> the Government has obtained under that Act the Senate will remember them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least that would give the Government some sort of <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to uranium which, apparently, the Government would not have over minerals generally throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has the power to maintain Australia’s national interests through his control <span class="highlight">powers</span> in respect to export and other matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These extra <span class="highlight">powers</span> are apparently sought by the Minister for somewhat dubious purposes and they will have the effect of overriding all existing rights that have been acquired under State laws and under the Northern Territory mining laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To make sure that the Act is extended in the fashion he desires, he has given comparisons with other countries that are leaders in the free enterprise system in the world and which have similar, if not greater, <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to the possession, use and regulation of uranium resources in their national interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact from my initial reading of the documents, those countries would have greater <span class="highlight">powers</span> than the Minister is seeking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that it is quite proper for the Minister to ask for these <span class="highlight">powers</span> and I can see no reason, if he had a policy which he wanted to implement, why he should not have these <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is asking for the extension of his <span class="highlight">powers</span> by this regulation and he still refuses to produce a plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These regulations are based on the wartime <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Atomic Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my mind there is an immense degree of control available in the <span class="highlight">powers</span> already held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that without these regulations the Commonwealth Government has already ample <span class="highlight">powers</span> to ensure the national interest in the exploration, conservation and orderly development of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition the States and the Territories have supplementary <span class="highlight">powers</span>, and they can work in cooperation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of <span class="highlight">powers</span> or regulations which  Mr Connor  is seeking and about which Opposition senators are apprehensive, they should bear in mind that in international bargaining places, whether it be in Asia, Britain or any other country, as far as arranging terms is concerned he has done pretty well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall concentrate my remarks on the reasons why the Government has sought these <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recognising that fact and the fact that we are giving this leadership, I would have hoped that the honourable senator would support the Government in obtaining the necessary <span class="highlight">powers</span> and ensuring that, in fact, we can exercise the needed control over the export and the development of uranium in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government says that the only policy it has- and it is its only policy- is the establishment of the Petroleum and Minerals Authority and if one couples that with the licensing power given to the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor)  under these regulations, and with the attitudes of mind and the statements which have been made by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  as well as the Minister for Minerals and Energy in relation to this rationalisation of the deposits in the Northern Territory, it makes me, as it is making the companies concerned, even more worried as to what are the real intentions and the real purposes of these regulations and these <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not at all sure about the precise <span class="highlight">powers</span> the Australian Government would have to deal with all the problems which are involved in regulating the dumping of mercury into waters or, indeed, whether the dumped mercury all comes from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-These 2 Bills which have been taken together relate to the exercise by the self governing legislature of the Territory of Papua New Guinea of certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> with respect to offshore mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition recognises that the Bills clarify a matter of some doubt in one respect and acknowledge the rights of the Territory of Papua New Guinea at this stage, and certainly when it becomes independent, to exercise full and plenary <span class="highlight">powers</span> over exploration for mining in its off-shore areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accepting that when the Territory of Papua New Guinea becomes independent it should have all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of a sovereign nation with regard to its off-shore areas, it is appropriate that there be no doubt that Papua New Guinea on independence will have that power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act is designed to carry forward logically and, one might suppose, is a matter of realisation of what was contemplated some 7 years ago, that some day the Territory of Papua New Guinea would exercise for itself <span class="highlight">powers</span> with regard to petroleum exploration and exploitation in its off-shore waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill excises from the parent Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act of 1967 all those provisions which vested the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of a designated authority in the relevant Australian Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely no organisation, whether an employee organisation or an employer organisation, would hand over the inherent right and <span class="highlight">powers</span> that they have in relation to the affairs of their own organisation to an outside body or to an industrial registrar unless petitioned by members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, as part of its general policy in this area, the Government is examining the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions of the Prices Justification Tribunal, lt is proposed to invite the Tribunal to scrutinise with care price claims that are based on wage costs in excess of awards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government sought those <span class="highlight">powers</span>, of course, during the prices and incomes referendum, but the Government recognised that it was powerless to force importers to pass those benefits on to the consumer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would be an inhibition upon the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of either House of the Parliament, which it is undesirable to express. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a new aspect within the stabilisation scheme on this occasion- the fact that the Board is being given supplementary borrowing <span class="highlight">powers</span> which will enable it to make earlier progressive payments than it has been able to do in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it does not have the right through the back door, through the top door or whatever it may be, of usurping the responsibilities and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the governments in those States in which it has not succeeded in gaining power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer will, of course, exercise these <span class="highlight">powers</span> in full consultation with me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These included possible Government involvement in the Australian capital market and industrial structure arising from the proposed additional <span class="highlight">powers</span>, extended functions and privileges of the Australian Industry Development Corporation; the implications for other financial institutions, in the money and capital market arising from the financing activities of the AIDC and the NIF; the consequent implications for resource use in the economy and the attainment of other economic and social objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740926_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Auditor-General is given full <span class="highlight">powers</span> of inspection of accounting records and is required to audit the Commission’s accounts and to report the results to the Minister annually. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740926_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus the Bill before the Senate will establish a Commission having the full statutory <span class="highlight">powers</span>, resources and organisation of related activities needed to implement the Government’s policies in respect to this vital industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740926_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The other amendments referred to involve supply management <span class="highlight">powers</span> and also full trading <span class="highlight">powers</span> which will be given to the Australian Wool Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740926_senate_29_s61/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I thought that I made myself clear when I indicated that the manner in which this legislation comes forward is such that there will be further amendments required to it in regard to supply management, trading <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Corporation and the establishment of a separate account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740926_senate_29_s61/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This painting represents him in his finest period at the very summit of his <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will be remembered that discussion took place earlier about <span class="highlight">powers</span> of entry when we were discussing some rural legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are extending this principle into the area of civil liberties and saying: Nobody is to be able to have these <span class="highlight">powers</span> unless there is some really good reason’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators know, there has been a tendency to extend the <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is saying that he wants to get rid of some of the <span class="highlight">powers</span>, but he wants to insert some words in clause 14 so that the clause will read: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are certainly given the <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the Commonwealth Constitution to make requests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But we believe that we can go to the United Nations and we have not got to look over our shoulders and decide what the attitude of the superpowers are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that  Senator Willesee  and the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  at the United Nations will be endeavouring to bridge the gap between the Arab States, with their corralling of oil reserves, and the super <span class="highlight">powers</span> who, in the main, have a different attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the attention of the Minister for the Media been drawn to the editorials appearing in the Melbourne ‘Herald’ and the ‘Sydney Morning Herald’ expressing criticism of proposed amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act which have been designed to settle the ambiguity of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if that be a criticism, because we are legislating to provide that the Board in exercising its <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this section shall confer not only with the commercial broadcasting and television stations in reaching determinations under this section of the Act, as it has to do at the present time, but also with other interested parties, I certainly would be prepared to consider giving a right of appeal to all such organisations and persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I want to make it quite clear that the Government insists that the legislation is designed to confirm what already has been believed by the Parliament and the public to be the existing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Board, and the legislation is being introduced only because those <span class="highlight">powers</span> have been challenged by some of the stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 7 April 1972 the then Acting PostmasterGeneral,  Senator Cotton,  said that the then Government- the Liberal Government- would be asked to consider an amendment to the Broadcasting and Television Act to clarify the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to regulate programs on Sunday mornings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is seeking to amend the Act to confirm the existing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Control Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister stated that the Government insists that the Bill is designed to confirm what has already been believed to be the existing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Board and is being introduced only because these <span class="highlight">powers</span> have been challenged by the licence holders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741017_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister agree that the proposed amendments to section 16(3) substantially amplify the regulatory <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Board by means of the use of directions in lieu of orders and regulations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741017_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are now seeking to do is to clarify the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which Parliament originally intended to give to the Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741017_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, of course, necessary that the Act operate and <span class="highlight">powers</span> under it be exercised so as to achieve the main object of this Bill, that is, a system in which one body can represent its members in Federal and State industrial jurisdictions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741017_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regrettably in this country the Federal Government is not armed with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> to manage the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741022_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators may recall that at the Constitutional Convention one of the broad propositions put forward by the Australian Government was that the Constitution should be altered so that the Federal Parliament would be able to arm the Government with the broad <span class="highlight">powers</span> of economic management which are held by governments of other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741022_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite absurd that the Government does not have clear <span class="highlight">powers</span> to manage the economy and that honourable senators opposite should take up their present stand when they will recall that they bitterly opposed the constitutional referendum to enable this Parliament to have <span class="highlight">powers</span> over incomes and prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741022_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is basic to the management of the economy, yet they took the stand that not even the Federal Parliament was to be entrusted with those constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741022_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has nothing to congratulate itself on in its repeated obstruction of the Government’s endeavours, even with its limited constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>, to act on behalf of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741022_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government wishes to prevent international airlines from uplifting excess quantities of fuel in Australia, is it not a fact that the Government has power to prevent them from doing so under the <span class="highlight">powers</span> available to his Department? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we were to read the second reading speech of the Minister for the Media  (Senator Douglas McClelland)  we could be delighted at its formation, because in his concluding remarks the Minister says that the Bill will establish a Commission having the full statutory <span class="highlight">powers</span>, resources, organisation and related activities needed to implement the Government’s policies in respect of this vital industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not think that a commission which is overridden in all its <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions by a Minister of Government is operating in the way in which any statutory body ought to operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I say that in my opinion the Senate should take a different viewpoint and in conferring, even under amended <span class="highlight">powers</span>, very great power on the Commission, it should make sure that in the end it is the Parliament which has the oversight of the use or misuse of those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, in this instance of conferring much wider <span class="highlight">powers</span> on the Commission I would like to see the oversight of it left with the Parliament itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has <span class="highlight">powers</span> of direction in so many areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister may, by writing under his hand, give directions to the Commission with respect to the exercise of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> or the performance of its functions but, except as provided by sub-section (2), shall not give such a direction with respect to a particular project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Previously in this chamber I have heard reference to the National Film Board of Canada, and I hope that the Minister will be able to enlighten us about the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the Canadian Minister has under the legislation which set up that Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one reads into that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the Minister may exercise one sees that complete satisfaction is given to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If documentary films are to be made for the Government by the Commission they should be made by decisions of the Commission in its function within the scope of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> and each of the decisions made by the Commission should not be subject to the approval of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 10 of the Canadian Act, which deals with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Board, reads: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is probably coincidental but it is frightening nevertheless that at a time when there is controversy about the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and the extent to which that Board may or may not have power over television and broadcasting stations- I do not embark upon the merits of whether what is proposed is good or bad- we have, at much the same time, this debate on what should be the Minister’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> over the Film Commission and the extent to which he should be able to direct what films should be made by this Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has refused to look at the further possibility of limiting the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister for the Media  (Senator Douglas McClelland);  he will not consider it in conjunction with the matter that we are discussing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> which have now been given to the Minister with regard to the assistance and the encouragement which can be given to films through the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 6 (<span class="highlight">Powers</span> of Commission). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister may, by writing under his hand, give directions to the Commission with respect to the exercise of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> or the performance of its functions but, except as provided by sub-section (2), shall not give such a direction with respect to a particular project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are setting up an Australian Film Commission which has any reality or any <span class="highlight">powers</span>, surely we cannot say in one clause that every one of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> is subject to the direction of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could have the ludicrous situation- I suppose that one must use the absurd to illustrate the situation- in which, if one gave the Commission complete <span class="highlight">powers</span> in this regard and funds were made available to it to the extent of $4m, $5m, $6m or whatever the sum might be, and there was no ministerial approval required of the manner in which that amount was to be expended, the Commission might decide of its own volition not to spend one cent in the making of a film, whether it be a short or a feature film. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was what we were seeking when we said that the Commission should be comprised of people of wisdom and experience who would be able to develop the functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission and give the assistance, encouragement and development to the industry which we hoped it would receive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) The Minister may, by writing under his hand, give directions to the Commission with respect to the exercise of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> or the performance of its functions but, except as provided by sub-section (2), shall not give such a direction with respect to a particular project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under clause 8 ( 1 ) the Minister may, by writing under his hand, give directions to the Commission with respect to the exercise of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> or the performance of its functions but, except as provided by sub-clause (2), shall not give such a direction with respect to a particular project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the worst thing about this sub-clause is that the Minister may give directions with respect to the exercise of the Commission’s <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> are given under this Bill and the performance of its functions are set out in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has power to give directions in relation to clause 6, which sets out the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission will no longer have all of these real <span class="highlight">powers</span> at all; it will be always subject to the direction of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is true not only in relation to its <span class="highlight">powers</span> but also in relation to its functions, such as the holding of meetings, which is dealt with in clause 27, the staff it employs, which is dealt with in clause 28, and the moneys it expends as well as the control of its moneys, which are dealt with in clause 32. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> given to the Commission throughout this Bill become a nullity because, under this clause, they are all subject to the direction of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means that we will have a Commission that does not have any independent <span class="highlight">powers</span> in any part of its functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I support what  Senator Guilfoyle  has already said very capably, namely, that we oppose the idea of giving the Minister these <span class="highlight">powers</span>, and I support her amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Tarin” Board, as it was then known, recommended the establishment of a Film Commission having the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of production, promotion, distribution and exhibition if necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are using the Commission’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> to talk of short films as a quota basis and if we are really talking about assistance to the Australian film industry, it may be that the Minister could have considered feature films as well as short films. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this Government in the last 18 or 20 months had not shown that it was prepared to use authoritarian <span class="highlight">powers</span> to achieve any objective which it wanted, if it had not shown that it was prepared to use patronage and money to achieve desired objectives, one might have viewed the intent of this particular clause more charitably than one does at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister shall give such directions as he thinks necessary for the purpose of ensuring the observance, in the exercise of <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this section, of the obligations of Australia under the Code of Liberalisation of Current Invisible Operations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the Commission or an authorised person shall comply with those directions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Government considered the drafting of the legislation for the Film Commission it agreed that the exercise of <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the Bill should be subject to Australia’s commitments under the OECD Code of Liberalisation of Current Invisible Operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 1 1 contains another of those authoritarian <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the Government is seeking to take under the guise of the Australian Film Commission Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To equate the desire of the Government for the Film Commission to get information by compulsory process from any person with the compulsory <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are occasionally found in health Acts which are concerned with public health is, I think, to have a sense of proportion which does not put public health or the Film Commission in its correct perspective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, it appears rather extraordinary that the Opposition should suggest that in the Commission’s day to day operations, the very area in which delegated <span class="highlight">powers</span> are most commonly required-  Senator Greenwood  has had a lot of opposition to voice in regard to ministerial approval in this area- the Minister should be required to exercise some sort of discretionary or approval power in relation to the delegation of power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commission may have good administrative reasons to ask another member to exercise those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Frankly, the passing of the amendment in relation to the clause would mean a significant increase in the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A working party was established for the purpose of determining its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my understanding that it is necessary first to establish the technical needs of the commission before an assessment can be made as to extending its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the early days of our nation when the Constitution was being interpreted and was developing its own particular glosses there was an extension of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth with regard to that head of power in a manner which had not been contemplated by those who had originally drafted and conceived the nature of the Federal power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that there are 4 possible solutions: The enlargement of Commonwealth power to legislate for terms and conditions of employment in industry and for trade unions; the transfer of certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Commonwealth by the States without referendum; complementary State and Federal legislation; or the encouragement of unions to go through the procedures required by law for the dissolution of State unions and the formation or State branches of federal unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The areas of inquiry are, I think, limited to 2 powersnamely, section 51 (i) and (xxix)- the trade and commerce and the external affairs <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So this is one case where, if that approach is correct, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition may agree that it is desirable in any event that the Australian Parliament exercise its <span class="highlight">powers</span>, because it seems that to do otherwise may not be fulfilling its international obligations as it should. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I understand it, an interdepartmental committee report has been prepared in relation to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Public Works Committee being extended over some of the statutory authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although this group of pensioners may be able to engage in employment, and most of them do so, many find that because of their disabilities their earning <span class="highlight">powers</span> are restricted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that stage the Commonwealth took unto itself the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the Constitution had given it and created a uniform divorce procedure and law throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this Bill, and particularly in the amendments which the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs proposes, there are suggestions that the Commonwealth should go further in exercising its <span class="highlight">powers</span> over marriage, divorce and matrimonial affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also contains enforcement <span class="highlight">powers</span> in respect to custody and access. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Labor Party / came to power, far from abolishing the commission it expanded and widened its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if members of a trade union, for instance, took action against a company providing any of those sources of power and the action was taken with regard to safety measures or wage issues, it would be enough to invoke these sweeping <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">powers</span> are even more repressive if one takes into consideration the most unusual and most offensive provision in the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Several wars have been fought on four continents; numerous governments have been forced from office by unconstitutional means, frequently involving violence and bloodshed; countries have been occupied by the armed forces of foreign <span class="highlight">powers</span>; population groups in a number of countries have turned on each other with ferocity, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These suggestions testify to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of imagination and dishonesty of those who make them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They would need to recognise their responsibility in developing a new type of court, acting with a minimum of formality, co-ordinating the work of ancillary specialists attached to the court encouraging conciliation and applying, only as a last resort, the judicial <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the court <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To this end, provisions are already contained in the Bill for appeal procedures which will protect the applicant for compensation and at the same time make it difficult for public servants to use their discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span> arbitrarily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But at a fairly early stage the Commonwealth decided to go it alone and the proposal for the referendum question on the reference of <span class="highlight">powers</span> was not taken back to the States and instead it was brought prematurely to this Parliament, where the Senate rejected it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government, by virtue of these <span class="highlight">powers</span>, can assume certain responsibilities for the health care of the population generally, which of course, includes pensioners, but it does not have an exclusive or even dominant responsibility in that field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government, by this legislation, basically is seeking to remove any legal doubt about whether or not the Australian Broadcasting Control Board has power to carry out its functions and to exercise its <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the existing Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first concerns the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Broadcasting Control Board to regulate appropriately the programs of commercial broadcasting and television stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent years some stations have challenged the Board’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the programming area by relying on a narrow legal definition of the word ‘standards’, and the Government’s legal advisers have confirmed that this approach may have some validity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Board has consistently drawn attention to this lack in its <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the past 7 years, but no action was taken by the previous Government to correct the anomaly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The relevant section of the Act is section 16, which sets out the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions of the Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The two new <span class="highlight">powers</span> I have referred to will place beyond question the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which, I think it is fair to say, the general public, and indeed the Parliament, have always thought the Board to have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is not attempting to enlarge the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate or its Committees; he is seeking to limit them, because if our power in this regard is confined to the interpretation for which he contends, it means that where we have the power we are compelled to exercise it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But because we chose in 1959 to call an Act the ‘Matrimonial Causes Act’ it does nothing to define or limit the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the Constitution gave to the Commonwealth- namely, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> over marriage, divorce and matrimonial causes and in relation thereto parental rights and the custody and guardianship of infants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Greenwood said: ‘Put the <span class="highlight">powers</span> into the State courts and let them decide’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this wide definition which covers maintenance cases now heard by State courts is not included there is no guarantee that the States will put such <span class="highlight">powers</span> into the State family courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Therefore I suggest that all these <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be put within the ambit of matrimonial cause and should be transferred, in my opinion and the opinion of some members of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, in many cases to the State courts, which are to be known as family courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be consolidated, and there should not be a continuation of the Rafferty’s rules type jurisdiction which splits matrimonial causes between Commonwealth courts, State courts, Supreme Courts and Petty Sessions courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding of clause 90(2) is that it contains a power to grant an injunction in circumstances in which it is not for the protection of a party, and an injunction under clause 90(2) is one which is relevant in relation to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are exercised under clause 14. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am advised that in the United States these compulsory <span class="highlight">powers</span> in regard to counselling have been done away with because experience has proved that it is not the way to go about this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in the context of proceedings for an injunction under proposed section 90 which, as  Senator Greenwood  correctly says, contains very heavy and serious <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is failing to appreciate the circumstances in which this power of direction or advice may be availed of not to recognise the need to enable the court to be able to assert its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, when we look at clause 90, the clause upon which this whole power in clause 14 hinges, we find that there are immense <span class="highlight">powers</span> given to the court in the issuing of the injunction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would remove the reference to the failure not constituting a contempt of the court, but then again one would hope that the court would not be involving itself in any kind of use of the contempt <span class="highlight">powers</span> for the reasons I indicated before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suspect that the purpose behind a provision of that character was to enable the marriage guidance conciliators to utilise their <span class="highlight">powers</span> of reconciliation to the utmost without any inhibition on the part of those seeking their advice who might think that some time in the future what they have said might be used against them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second reading speech of the Minister for the Environment and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  representing the Minister for the Media, stated that the amendments gave 2 new <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Australian Broadcasting Control Board which the general public had always thought the Board had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am confident that the public does not believe that the Board had such <span class="highlight">powers</span> nor would it have been accepted in Australian society that such an infringement of the freedom of the Press would be tolerated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To suggest that the amendments which were introduced clarified existing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Board or those <span class="highlight">powers</span> which were thought to exist is to overlook the intrusion which would now be possible into every function of a licensee of broadcasting and television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, by this legislation, basically is seeking to remove any legal doubt about whether or not the Australian Broadcasting Control Board has power to carry out its functions and to exercise its <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the existing Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That Part of the Act states that in exercising its functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this section in relation to commercial broadcasting and commercial television stations the Board shall consult representatives of those stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps I should say that if a government is serious in stating that it simply wants to clarify the existing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Board, why has it introduced amendments which so considerably extend the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Board? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Powers</span> that will allow it to control program content and advertising seem to me to be not expressing the present <span class="highlight">powers</span>; they are a considerable extension of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think in fairness to the statements made by the Government we should draw attention to these extended <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are sought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To have the confusion that stems from the variety of existing terminology is to place in our minds the doubt as to whether seeking to clarify the Board’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> would allow to occur through the Bill unlimited, undefined power in the hands of the government appointed Authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of placing by stealth an undefined, unlimited control in the hands of a government appointed authority and to pretend that this control is not an extension of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which already exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To say, as the Minister did, that everyone thought these <span class="highlight">powers</span> existed, I am sure overstates the situation and the way that people feel with regard to this important means of communication in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During that period of 23 years it introduced 21 amendments to the legislation, and one can search the record of debates in relation to those 2 1 Bills and one will not find, I suggest, any assertion that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred by the 1948 legislation had been abused or were not necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that when the Opposition’s attitude to this legislation was being stated in another place the gravamen of the attack on it was that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that were given by section 16, as it would read if these amendments were agreed to, were not subject to parliamentary scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now when the Government yields on that matter and proposes, as the Minister for the Media has said will be done, that in committee, if this Bill reaches the committee stage, to insert a provision that the basic regulatory <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the authority be subject to scrutiny by Parliament in the same manner as regulations are, the Opposition virtually dismisses that by a reference of a few words and ignores it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest not and one only has to look at the position in England and in Canada to see that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> given by this legislation, which are really <span class="highlight">powers</span> to clarify legal doubts that have arisen, are in no way different from what is considered proper elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Opposition: In what way does section 1 6, as it would be amended if these amendments were agreed to, go beyond <span class="highlight">powers</span> which in those  2  countries at least have been considered appropriate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Guilfoyle  referred to section 1 7 of the Act which gives the Board power in these terms: In exercising its <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions under the Act to make such orders, give such directions and do all such things as it thinks fit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true, as I understand it, that section 17 has seldom been used but it does seem to me that if the Opposition succeeds in defeating the second reading of this Bill it will be necessary for the Board, as it would remain, to consider exercising those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has had power to make orders to give effect to those <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions and, under section 99, it has had a direct control over standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To mention examples of statutes in which a similar power is contained in order to permit the function to be carried out, I need mention only the Australian National Airlines Act, the Australian Tourist Commission Act, the Australian Shipping Commission Act and the Australian Wool Corporation Act, all of which have general <span class="highlight">powers</span> identical with that contained in clause 6 (a) of this Bill and none of which has ever been suggested as an unnecessary or an excessive power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the fact that that provision puts in proper legal perspective the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Authority to carry out its functions, I ask: Wherein does it differ from the existing power in section 99 of the present Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask members of the Opposition whether they will also answer this question: In the 23 years in which the Opposition parties were in government was there any instance in which it could fairly be claimed, and perhaps the Government blamed for it, that there had been an improper exercise of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Board as those <span class="highlight">powers</span> were spelled out in the 1948 legislation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should have thought that the Opposition, knowing that its attitude may result in the destruction of this legislation at the second reading stage, would have been at pains in fairness to mention at least some of the safeguards in relation to the exercise of these newly arranged <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place the Government has met the main objection of the Opposition in another place, namely that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Authority would not be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that for the first time in these amendments the Minister is mentioned so far as <span class="highlight">powers</span> are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been told that in certain quarters of the television management area there has been a pervasive influence of threat that has come out of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board’s view of the situation, and that it had been expected that this legislation would come before the Parliament because certain statements needed the backing of legislation and certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> had to be confirmed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he wanted to strengthen existing <span class="highlight">powers</span>, he should have tried to strengthen existing <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can assume only that this Bill is really a statement of no confidence in the existing negotiating <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could not imagine that the Board, with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the existing Act, could not effectively go to management of the media and demand and get co-operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to the Minister that it is not a good atmosphere in which the Minister asks the Senate to approve extensive increases in the Control Board ‘s <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the policy standing as it is in that regard, the example of what another type of Labor government will do in a State and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the Minister asks for now, I must vote against this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, the negotiating <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Board have not been fully used in respect of its intentions if it says that its Act at the moment is not strong enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is this: To what extent would <span class="highlight">powers</span> be put into the Act if this amending Bill were passed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the hands of the wrong person the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that would be given by this Bill would enable much of the freedom of the radio and television stations to be removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this Bill could be coupled with some other ideas the Government has, for instance, moving into the area of a newspaper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Board, specifically provided by an Act of Parliament which has been amended by a series of conservative governments, we find that the Board shall have power to determine the hours during which programs may be broadcast or televised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that that is the wish of the Australian people and that they have believed that the Broadcasting Control Board always was vested with those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this Parliament always thought that the Control Board was vested with those <span class="highlight">powers</span> and that the Australian people felt that the Broadcasting Control Board should have the responsibility to determine how much advertising is allowable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But by rejection of this legislation all those things that the Australian people believe to be the responsibility of the Board under <span class="highlight">powers</span> they thought were vested in it are going to be denied the Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suggestions were  made for strengthening the Board’s <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that this could be a useful deterrent in the Board’s armoury of <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will be asked to consider an amendment to the legislation to clarify the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to regulate programs on Sunday morning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government will legislate to make clear the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board with regard to Sunday morning television programmes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Announcing this today the Acting Postmaster-General  (Senator Robert Cotton)  said the Government had considered the situation which had arisen as a result of the challenge to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Board by station GTV in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Cotton said the Government had for some time been engaged in a full scale review of the Board ‘s <span class="highlight">powers</span> but this would take some time to complete. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to be noted also that within the Territories power is being sought to allow the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of a permanent head to be exercised in accordance with <span class="highlight">powers</span> granted by ordinance to persons who are in charge of offices within the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Section 50 of the Principal Act is amended by inserting after sub-section5B a further sub-section: 5C Every member of a Promotions Appeal Committee shall before proceeding to perform the duties or exercise the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of a member of a Promotions Appeal Committee take an oath or make an affirmation in the form in Schedule 6 ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1960 the Board was given <span class="highlight">powers</span> to rule ineligible any person it thought was not ‘a fu and proper person to be an officer of the Commonwealth Service’, a provision which could cover almost anything and was not subject to appeal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for the necessary legislative authority for delegation of the Commission’s <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is to take full advantage of the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Government, particularly in relation to exchange control regulations where they have regard to financial transactions overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The comment has been made that governments need to have full legal <span class="highlight">powers</span> to control financial aspects of all the various types of transactions which may be entered into between residents of Australia and residents of overseas countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first of these is the Health Insurance Commission Act, which authorises the establishment of the Commission, defines its <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions, provides for the manner in which it is to be financed and for associated matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-66-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is nice to see that senators opposite are starting to read and agree with some of the statements that are being made around the world by <span class="highlight">powers</span> that they once accused of being almost in league with the devil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Part VI of the Act is amended by the Bill to provide for the functions now assigned to and <span class="highlight">powers</span> held by the Governor-General under sections 58 to 61 of the Act to be conferred on and exercised by the High Commissioner of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Much can be achieved by Labor members of the State parliaments in effectuating Labor’s aims of more effective <span class="highlight">powers</span> for the national parliament and for local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that everyone would welcome the proposed changes and would accept that it is proper that we have efficient regulations which are clearly worded and which give adequate <span class="highlight">powers</span> to achieve the purposes of exchange control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment in no way limits the Treasurer’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> to approve criminal proceedings under the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations against persons who have not obtained the appropriate exchange control authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We certainly find that judges do not like exercising <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this character because out of the blue, as it were, they have to decide what is a just and worthy case and what is not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party has used its <span class="highlight">powers</span> and its patronage in a host of areas, such as the way in which  Mr Clyde  Cameron, as the Minister for Labor and Immigration, dispenses 6 months previous average weekly earnings to some people who are put out of work, in the way in which it can be used through the Australian Assistance Plan - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I have no doubt that if this Government was again to seek those <span class="highlight">powers</span> which must be held at the Federal level- they are not effective through the States- again the Opposition would oppose us and it would do exactly the sorts of things that it did on the last occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the majority of Australians, I believe, are now realising that the Government was right last year when it sought those Federal <span class="highlight">powers</span> over prices and incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister said that the Government did not have these <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The States have said to the Commonwealth Government: If you want a temporary transfer of those <span class="highlight">powers</span> ask for them and we will give them to you’, but the Government has not sought to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The current alibi is: We would have controlled these things but you did not give us the <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government can get those <span class="highlight">powers</span> by reference if it asks for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government in fact, in my view, has those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned that its <span class="highlight">powers</span> in this area generally were under considerable legal doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to violence in children’s programs, the number of advertisements that are shown in children’s viewing time, what programs should be shown in children’s viewing time, family viewing time, or adult viewing time and the Board’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole ambit of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions of the Board is under question, I have asked my colleague, the Attorney-General, to provide me with the benefit of senior counsel so I can have legal advice as to the real <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions of the Board in the light of the present law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These extensions merely use Australian Government constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> which, because of the indifference of earlier government to environmental issues, were never applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people who founded the Constitution desired certain actions or gave certain <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In announcing the Government’s decision on the support of the wool market, I stated the intention of the Government to assist the Corporation in operating the floor price, and in its general activities in the market, by providing it with adequate <span class="highlight">powers</span> to manage the supply of wool offered for sale, and by widening its trading <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also announced that attention would be given to the possible restructuring of the board of the Corporation to provide appropriate improvements, where necessary, having regard to the additional <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be conferred on the Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Extension of Trading <span class="highlight">Powers</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amendments are proposed in the Bill to enlarge the specific trading <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Corporation in this area were originally designed principally to enable it to dispose of the wool purchased under its reserve price operations, and, although they extend somewhat beyond this, they include restrictions which hamper the Corporation in some transactions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are very wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> and hence the necessity for some ministerial control over their use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not envisaged that the Corporation will use all of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> immediately, but rather as and when circumstances warrant their use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation therefore provides a framework for approval to be given to the Corporation to engage in particular forms of trading activity appropriate to the needs and best interests of the wool industry, and in accordance with any guidance provided by the Minister for Agriculture concerning the exercise of those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill that I now present recognises this need in a number of ways, but mainly in providing for the establishment of a strong administrative agency, which will have access to relevant information and effective <span class="highlight">powers</span> to intervene where intervention appears to be desirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That seems to me to be a totally unwarranted power to give to the Minister in addition to all his other quite complete controlling and supervisory <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to approval and inquiry and all the other many-sided facets of control involved in giving his approval. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, our major objection to this legislation is that the determination of land prices in the Northern Territory should be one of the new <span class="highlight">powers</span> which should be transferred to the new Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is not it would be necessary to redeclare the area and to reinstitute the <span class="highlight">powers</span> to acquire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore not possible to vary the acquisition <span class="highlight">powers</span> merely by an ordinance of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly because the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister and the processes lie within Federal Acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second stage, as to what specific <span class="highlight">powers</span> are to go over to the new Assembly, is a matter for decision in the light of the Joint Committee ‘s recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have limited <span class="highlight">powers</span> and limited options available to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government had to take measures- with the restricted <span class="highlight">powers</span> that it has in the economic circumstances which have prevailed during the past few months- to try to dampen this over-heated situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Hall  made the point, I believe quite correctly, that cost inflation is now the main problem in this economy, as well as the fact that we do not have control over our incomes and our prices- a control which this Government foresaw 12 months ago was a necessary ingredient of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> if it was going to control a cost inflation situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When we sought those <span class="highlight">powers</span> we were opposed by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It knew that by opposing our efforts to get those <span class="highlight">powers</span> it would be deliberately robbing this Government of one of the most powerful weapons that it could have to fight inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By a deliberate act of the Liberal and Country Parties to ensure that the Government would not be able to grapple with inflation- that was the real purpose of their opposition- we have been denied those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I also accept the fact that the other night he was prepared to admit that when the proposal in relation to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> over prices and incomes came before the Australian people last year he did not support it, that he could not see the wisdom of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that his argument will be sufficient to convince some members of the Opposition that those <span class="highlight">powers</span> are indeed an effective weapon which is currently being denied the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reference to the failure of the Commonwealth to have any ability to control prices and incomes ought to be set in the context that the State governments offered to refer <span class="highlight">powers</span> in a co-operative venture, which would have been much the wisest thing to have done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matter of referral of State <span class="highlight">powers</span> was raised by the Prime Minister at the Constitutional Convention in September 1973 and has been pursued subsequently with the States but with no results, so far as the non-Labor States are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-71-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-While Senator Baume might be right in saying there would be a good deal of obstruction to this scheme he is ignoring the disciplinary <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the Government has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise that if in its <span class="highlight">powers</span> and provisions the Bill were to do those things it would have the emphatic support of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of its main challenges is that it seeks to derive <span class="highlight">powers</span> from a series of alleged heads of power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seeks power within the States in particular ways and it seeks power from its external <span class="highlight">powers</span> relating to foreign treaties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it looks to such <span class="highlight">powers</span> as those over trade and commerce, and tourism and, of course, to its external <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> under it cover virtually anything and honourable senators should bear in mind that the Bill seeks the power to make regulations under this Treaty and some 4 others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to have a treaty which may be signed, as it is, and which only 4 nations out of some 100 have gone along with, and then to say that we will make regulations is stretching the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of government and government by regulation too far. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The thing that I am perturbed about- I have already alerted the Minister to this- is that when this parks system comes into being and the authority is created the Alligator River system will need effective monitoring in relation to just what <span class="highlight">powers</span> the Director should have to control mining waste products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to be sure, if it is to be under the control of  Dr Cass  and future Ministers for the Environment and Conservation, that there are adequate <span class="highlight">powers</span> to ensure that the Minister will not be subservient to perhaps some Minister for Minerals and Energy who might encourage a mineral survey in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I said in my argument that clause 69 should be deleted and that it is too wide a function to give to the Commonwealth the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of implementing treaties by regulation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can only hope that one day by constitutional referendum the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Parliament will be increased so that this measure can be a much more embracing one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that to give any government in Australia the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which this Bill gives- that is, to roam into all areas of human affairs as this Bill permitsought to be scrutinised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said that, I think it is important, nevertheless, to draw attention to the width of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the dangers which are involved on the basis that it might even be a warning to Government that if the <span class="highlight">powers</span> are exercised or abused in a certain way then, the Opposition, when it comes back into Government in the not too distant future will, I hope, correct and remedy some of the things contained in this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I suggest that you cannot resolve satisfactorily these environmental protection questions by simply saying that individuals can be subjected to all sorts of impositions, to coercive <span class="highlight">powers</span>, because the environment requires that individuals must submit to those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Corporation will have <span class="highlight">powers</span> similar to those at present contained in the Defence Service Homes Act including the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of construction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the main, the Opposition supports the additional <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are proposed for the Wool Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#debate-76">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We wanted to find out whether this direction applied only to the supply and management section of the Corporation’s new <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the future operations of the Corporation in that area because when one talks about the wool industry one covers a pretty wide field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#debate-76">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is rather interesting that yesterday the teachers organisation said, in effect, that we might be right about States’ <span class="highlight">powers</span> but the money involved was so important to them that they wanted us to allow the subjugation of the States to be put into legislation concerning grants and assistance for technical education in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#debate-76">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore we have a Bill which gives greatly extended <span class="highlight">powers</span>- far more than the Corporation needs- in regard to operating in its own right, as  Senator Maunsell  said, in one of the greatest industries in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#debate-76">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole purpose of this legislation is to strengthen the wool industry and in particular to strengthen the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the functions of the Australian Wool Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#debate-76">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been said, because of the very great government financial involvement now in the wool industry- to the extent, when this legislation is passed, of $350m- it is incumbent on the Government to ensure that the people who are on the Corporation and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions of the Corporation are commensurate with the responsibility the Government has taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#debate-76">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the question raised by  Senator Hall  about processing and manufacturing, it is implicit in the wool marketing report of the Corporation that the Corporation should have the <span class="highlight">powers</span> granted in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#debate-76">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally, the financial implications do require certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> of direction which were recognised by our predecessors- just as they are recognised by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#debate-76">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were also concerned to ensure that these borrowing <span class="highlight">powers</span> would not be expanding the present limits on borrowing by the AIDC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-83-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also, I think, quite clear under the Corporation’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> that any of the moneys borrowed by Australia on its behalf and on-lent to it will only be available to the Corporation for its assistance in projects put up to it by Australian industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-83-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Australian Industry Development Corporation apparently has not been able to establish itself in the international money market as being equivalent to a government institution and that it has to come before the Parliament and obtain <span class="highlight">powers</span> whereby the Government itself has to borrow on behalf of AIDC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-83-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, as I have said, it is a matter of regret that the AIDC has not so fully established itself as a borrower in the international money market that it is necessary for it to come before the Parliament and request the Parliament to give these <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Australian Government to borrow on its behalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-83-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that it will be able in the near future to establish itself fully in the international money market so that it will not be necessary to make use of these <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-83-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These persons will have coercive <span class="highlight">powers</span> greater than members of the police forces in Australia to require persons to attend before them, to deliver up documents, to answer questions and to suffer penalties and possibly imprisonment if they do not do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#debate-93">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The width of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> has already been adverted to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#debate-93">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the power is contained in the legislation and it is a coercive power of the greatest significance because of the width of the inquiries which commissioners could undertake and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which they would have to compel people to appear before them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#debate-93">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are arbitrary <span class="highlight">powers</span> which would be exercised by a non-judicial officer and this type of provision should be regarded by this Parliament as inconsistent with the rule of law and the protection of liberties in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#debate-93">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Likewise, it is an offence to insult a commissioner in the exercise of his <span class="highlight">powers</span> or the performance of his functions or duties as a commissioner, yet he has such wide-ranging functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the ordinary person may not know when a commissioner is exercising his functions or his duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#debate-93">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I speak as one who is concerned that this Parliament should ever enact laws under which coercive <span class="highlight">powers</span> can be used without restraint, guidelines or criteria to limit the way in which they could be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#debate-93">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have not had those <span class="highlight">powers</span> and I am sure that one of the reasons we did not obtain them was that our opponents- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not mentioning any names, but I believe that the members of the Liberal and Country Parties and some persons outside those parties were sufficiently misguided as not to understand the significance of the need for those <span class="highlight">powers</span> at Federal level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole legislative program which we have had since the Parliament assembled under a Labor Government in 1973 has been a continual attack on the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have been marked by the great threat to the sovereign <span class="highlight">powers</span>, the States and local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clauses 5, 6 and 1 1 of the Bill establish the Commission and set down its functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These features and <span class="highlight">powers</span> are typical of corporations with comprehensive urban development functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with the Government’s view that the Commission must be a forceful body and be able to operate so that the rebuilding of Darwin might take place in an orderly way, clause 55 of the Bill excludes the operation of the Town Planning Ordinance 1 964- 1971 of the Territory as far as the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions of the Commission are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill undoubtedly considerably alters the present <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the City of <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Darwin and its town planning arrangements and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and so forth of the Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am pointing out is that the Bill does have a very wide-ranging effect, giving very great <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Commission and to the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answering this question let me remind honourable senators that last year the Australian Government presented to this Parliament a Bill to amend the Broadcasting and Television Act which, if it had been enacted, would have given supervisory power to the Australian Parliament- not to the Government but to the Parliament- over the existing regulatory <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Broadcasting Control Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone in the Senate in particular should realise that this Parliament determined as recently as last November that the regulatory <span class="highlight">powers</span> should remain with the Board, not with this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My re-reading of the debate satisfies me that  Senator Withers  was making the important point that the way in which the Federal Government of this country has in recent months and years treated the States, the actions by the Government both in regard to the Gair affair and in regard to the interference by constitutional amendment with the States’ rights in regard to the Senate by introducing non-State representatives and also the attacks that have constantly been made on States and the infringement of their <span class="highlight">powers</span> have left many State leaders in a position where they considerably fear the intentions of this Government, and I think justifiably so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it is a matter in which State leaders have the greatest of fears for the future of their <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The assumption was that the States, which were left with other taxing <span class="highlight">powers</span> except the power of raising excise duties, would in the space of 10 years be able to reorganise their finances and to find other sources of revenue and after 10 years would be able to operate on thenown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was to have 2 pillars, one a monopoly on income tax <span class="highlight">powers</span> by the Commonwealth and the other a reimbursement to the States of income tax revenues forgone by the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, in essence, the whole approach to giving a proportion of the Commonwealth’s revenues to the States has been confined essentially to an approach as to what the States themselves had forgone by their surrender- it was hardly a surrender because it was imposed on them- of their income taxing <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill gives the Commission and in particular the Minister very extensive <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill sets up a Commission which is to have these very wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> for a period of 5 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not challenge in any way the necessity for that period of 5 years for such a herculean task as this will be, but I think it is only fair to point out that the Bill gives the Commission and the Minister over this period of 5 years very extensive <span class="highlight">powers</span> as to the replanning of Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we read the Bill, it will give the Commission and the Minister complete <span class="highlight">powers</span> in respect of replanning Darwin, including <span class="highlight">powers</span> which would enable it to decide upon the closure of certain areas of Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to carry out the replanning and rebuilding of Darwin the Bill gives the Commission and the Minister <span class="highlight">powers</span> to override any laws existing in the Northern Territory which may impede the Commission in its operations and which may be contrary to its own decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recognise that these <span class="highlight">powers</span> may well be necessary in the case of the serious emergency which has arisen but they would not necessarily be required for a period of 5 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must at all times bear in mind that we are setting up this Commission with such <span class="highlight">powers</span> for a considerable time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are given to the Minister are such that they may completely override the Commission in all respects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly it is rather surprising and disappointing that the Bill should be chock-full of ministerial <span class="highlight">powers</span> and discretions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extent of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> are such that the Commission by and large is virtually an arm of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore we believe that there should be some limitations on the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here again we come back to these extraordinary <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other amendment of consequencehopefully all our amendments are of consequence but I cannot detail them all now- which I should mention at this stage because it is a matter of policy relates to the town planning functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have already indicated, they are very considerable <span class="highlight">powers</span> indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition does not intend to take away any of those <span class="highlight">powers</span> although it has indicated some limits within which the Minister should exercise his <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We concede that such <span class="highlight">powers</span> will be necessary for this Commission to do its job properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Bill gives to a Commission extraordinary <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Of replanning, yes; but the real essence is the approach to the emergency <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The emergency <span class="highlight">powers</span> have been given to deal with an emergency situation, but the honourable senator will agree with me that the manner in which these emergency <span class="highlight">powers</span> are employed is the real consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reference was made to the term of the Commission but it is a maximum term and it is quite possible that in 18 months or 2 years the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission can be limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the Darwin Reconstruction Commission will accept it will still remain under the direction of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission shall comply with any directions given to it by the Minister with respect to the performance of its functions or the exercise of its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Chairman  of the Commission, who is an outstanding Australian, has his potential <span class="highlight">powers</span> totally emasculated by this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let nobody think that the appointment of  Sir Leslie  Thiess as the  Chairman  of the Commission will enable  Sir Leslie  to bring his undoubted <span class="highlight">powers</span> to bear in Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the town planning <span class="highlight">powers</span> and every rule of law that normally exists is being swept aside and the Commission is being given overriding <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not going to get away with the argument that it wants police <span class="highlight">powers</span>, military type <span class="highlight">powers</span>, for 5 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see nothing wrong with giving to the Minister the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which have been provided in State parliaments and which up till now have been provided in the national Parliament by the previous Government and the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Minister for Northern Development and the Minister for the Northern Territory, who has spent a great deal of time in Darwin since the tragedy, and the Minister for Urban and Regional Development have shown that they want to use the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of persuasion and discussion in order to resolve these difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That figure is based on town planning advice to take into the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission all those matters that are necessary to develop a properly planned city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have indicated already in my speech at the second reading stage of the Bill, the Opposition believes it is important that the Minister who is given such extensive <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this Bill should be clearly identified, and that the Minister should be the Minister for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not propose to read the functions fully but they do give the most extensive <span class="highlight">powers</span> to this Commission, the nature of which I dealt with in my speech yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular they give to the Commission and to the Minister extensive town planning roles and <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition attaches very great importance to this amendment which is designed to ensure that any planning determinations, any new town plan or any determination affecting the use of land within these very wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> should at least be made available for public inspection and public consideration and that anybody who is affected by that plan should have the opportunity of objecting to it and having his objections heard by the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission is to take over from the few people who at present have emergency <span class="highlight">powers</span> in Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one has objected to those emergency <span class="highlight">powers</span> being held by 1, 2, 3 or 4 people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By this legislation those emergency <span class="highlight">powers</span> will be passed to the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> we give to the Commission might not be necessary after 12 months but we think they are necessary now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole thrust of the Bill is to take <span class="highlight">powers</span> away from the administration in Darwin, to invest them in this huge Darwin Reconstruction Commission and to ignore to a large extent the wishes of the people of Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are <span class="highlight">powers</span>, which will be dealt with later, whereby the Commission can authorise people to go on to other people’s land and demolish the buildings that are there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a matter of three or six or twelve months, if these <span class="highlight">powers</span> were exercised, people would say: ‘What are our rights in the matter?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 9 gives the widest conceivable <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Minister under the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission shall comply with any directions given to it by the Minister with respect to the performance of its functions or the exercise of its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has <span class="highlight">powers</span> to curtail the activities of the Commission and to hand them over to local government or local control as fast as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But now we have a whole city devastated and what we are doing is bringing down emergency provisions to give emergency <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will delay the reconstruction of Darwin and the passing over of <span class="highlight">powers</span> from the Commission to authorities or a corporate institution in Darwin which will have to bear the full burden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government did not declare a state of emergency but by means of legislation it is seeking emergency <span class="highlight">powers</span> to enable a Commission to do this work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We understood that it was to have <span class="highlight">powers</span> to cope with it but what did we find when the Government brought down this Bill? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me a very fair compromise between the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which we on this side of the chamber think the Darwin Reconstruction Commission ought to have and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the Government thinks it ought to have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because we believe that it is important that a Bill like this and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> contained in it should not be wider than necessary we are moving to restrict the power under this clause to the Darwin area rather than to the whole of the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we own the land, we will be compelled to take action to develop the store outside the <span class="highlight">powers</span> granted to the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very pleasing to note that the Minister is having regard to the rights of individuals who could be seriously affected by such overweening <span class="highlight">powers</span> as would be contained in these clauses if they were not amended in accordance with my motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission may commence to perform its functions and exercise its <span class="highlight">powers</span> when the  Chairman,  the General Manager or an Acting General Manager, and 2 other members have been appointed and the performance of the functions or the exercise of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission is not affected by reason only of there being a vacancy or vacancies in the membership of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its amendment to clause 18 (3) states that the Commission may commence to perform its functions and exercise its <span class="highlight">powers</span> when the  Chairman,  the General Manager and or an Acting General Manager, and 2 other members have been appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the attitude of the Assembly is concerned, on 2 January this year, within a few days of the cyclone, the Assembly met and passed a motion commending the Government for its prompt action following the cyclone and, furthermore, it introduced and passed an emergency <span class="highlight">powers</span> Bill at the request of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be widely known that on 2 January the Legislative Assembly met and gave emergency <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where the Council thinks it desirable to do so, to give advice to the Commission in relation to any matter that is likely to affect the interests of persons who are or become resident in the Darwin Area and in relation to which the Commission may exercise its <span class="highlight">powers</span> or perform its functions; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to give advice to the Commission on any matter referred to the Council by the Commission in connexion with the exercise of those <span class="highlight">powers</span>, the performance of those functions or the operation of this Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Where the Council thinks it desirable to do so, to give advice to the Commission in relation to any matter that is likely to affect the interests of persons who are or become resident in the Darwin Area and in relation to which the Commission may exercise its <span class="highlight">powers</span> or perform its functions; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill gives quite extraordinary <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Darwin Reconstruction Commission in the reconstruction of the Darwin area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite properly, the Commission should have extraordinary <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for suspending or modifying, or adapting for the purposes of this Act, the operation of a law of the Territory dealing with a matter to which the functions or <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission relate; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This clause gives the Governor-General power to make regulations for suspending, modifying or adapting for the purposes of this proposed Act the operation of a law of the Northern Territory dealing with a matter to which the functions or <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission relate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that this is another one of these very wide dragnet <span class="highlight">powers</span>, albeit one which can be exercised by regulation and albeit a fact that that regulation can be disallowed by Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be unfortunate if the only way in which any change in laws which are within the jurisdiction and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of that Assembly could be brought about was by disallowance of regulations here in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission appears to have the most ample <span class="highlight">powers</span> to make decisions in regard to the replanning and reconstruction of Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its decisions will undoubtedly affect a good many of the existing laws by virtue of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are given anyway under this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have no plans to use them, but one can envisage that in a drastic operation of reconstruction within a 5-year period the Commission cannot be held up if the Parliament thinks it is permissible and reasonable to give it <span class="highlight">powers</span> over some local regulation which would hold it up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit to you,  Mr Chairman,  and honourable senators, that this is an emergency, that the Government must have this power and that it can be relied upon that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> will not be abused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This provision does not give power as such to the Executive; it gives regulating <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Executive that makes the regulation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Grants Commission were extended to enable it to make recommendations for direct grants to local government bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It stands, amongst other things, for amendment of the Australian Constitution to clothe the Parliament of Australia with such plenary <span class="highlight">powers</span> as are necessary and desirable to achieve international co-operation, national planning and the party’s economic and social objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the speech which I have just quoted he canvassed a number of ways in which Labor could tackle constitutional reform either through ordinary amendment or by using different devices such as State governments referring <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He put a paper headed ‘Labor Policies and Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Powers</span> ‘ to that Conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Later, and more dramatically, after the Second World War, when the Commonwealth endeavoured to establish that it should retain the uniform taxing <span class="highlight">powers</span>, there was another case called Victoria v. The Commonwealth, reported in 99 Commonwealth Law Reports in 1957. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that the power conferred by that provision is well exercised although ( I ) the State is bound to apply the money specifically to an object that has been denned, (2) the object is outside the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth, (3) the payments are left to the discretion of the Commonwealth Minister, (4) the money is provided as the Commonwealth’s contribution to an object for which the State is also to contribute funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will find that other factors, which this Government predicted late in 1973 and which were the reason why we sought the prices and incomes <span class="highlight">powers</span> for the Federal Government, contributed mainly to the unemployment in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While noting that other motions considered at the meeting calling for stringent action are still the subject of a postal ballot, I ask: ( 1 ) Is the Minister aware of the strong objections of most Victorian solicitors to the development of a Government service under no statutory authority, operating beyond the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth and under no agreement or arrangement with other legal aid services which have operated effectively in this area for many years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So too are the functions the Council will have to meet, the Government’s objectives for the arts and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> the Government believes are necessary to achieve those objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subject to the directions of the Minister, the Council will be required to delegate functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the boards, and each board will be responsible for developing policies in its own area of the arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause  8  in the present Bill empowers the Minister to give directions to the Commission ‘with respect to the exercise of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> or the performance of its functions’, but excludes him from giving a direction with respect to ‘a particular project’ except in the case of films to be produced for the Government itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the exercise and performance of its  <span class="highlight">powers</span>,  duties, functions and authorities the Corporation shall, except where it is required to make a recommendation to the Minister, be subject to the general control and direction of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill also diners from the original legislation proposed last year in provisions relating to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Film Commission to impose an Australian short film’ quota for Australian cinemas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard the Government has closely considered the text of the debate that took place in the Senate in the last sessional period and as a result of suggestions by some honourable senators, the Government is now ensuring that Parliament should scrutinise the operations of the Commission, and the exercise by the Commission of its quotamaking <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other minor amendments suggested by honourable senators have been incorporated in this new Bill in areas dealing with the delegation of the Commission’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> or functions, and with the level of fines for a breach of secrecy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should be grateful to know whether the Government of Australia in its pourparlers with the Government in Jakarta has obtained understandings which have been reduced to writing so that there can be no equivocation when this Bill becomes law and is given royal assent on whether the process for which the <span class="highlight">powers</span> are assumed and will be assumed by the Australian Government in the context of Australian fisheries can be sustained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill will not in any way disturb the balance of <span class="highlight">powers</span> between the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first was that there should be no appeal from a decision of the High Court on a matter involving the limits inter se of the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth, and those of any State or States without the certificate of the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With those guidelines, sincere people desiring to expose but not to expand the true constitutional limits would say: ‘When Federation was established we established a High Court and a federal judiciary’, which in relation to the next Bill to be debated by the Senate I shall try to demonstrate that the Government is seeking to confuse and condemn the country by exploitation ‘but in the State sphere we maintained the Supreme Courts, the State judiciaries, the State Constitutions, the State <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the State laws’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One was the very wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister and the discretions that were given to both the Minister and the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second area was the arbitrary <span class="highlight">powers</span> that appeared to be given to the Commission without any rights of appeal or compensation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fourth area of concern was the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the General Manager and his position, not as a servant of the Commission, but as an appointee of the Governor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is disappointed and concerned that the Government has not seen fit to accept its amendment which endeavoured to attenuate the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister generally to give directions to the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, there are the inter se questions as to the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth and the States which the High Court may certify as properly appealable to the Privy Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The resolution of those difficulties resulted in the compromise which is now section 74 of the Constitution, and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which were conferred upon the Commonwealth Parliament under secion 74 are now fully utilised in the only way in which one can have an exclusive legislative fulfilment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of the original jurisdiction, the Bill proposes to gather in various <span class="highlight">powers</span> of administration of the law that are now occupied by the High Court and also by the State courts, particularly in relation to taxation matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not an attack on the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of State courts, <span class="highlight">powers</span> which in Federal matters they have fortuitously held for three-quarters of a century because they existed at the time of Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the Federal Court of Bankruptcy, the Industrial Court, the Family Court- established under the Family Law Bill as this Senate agreed to it; it is not law yet- 6 separate State supreme courts, the supreme courts of the 2 Territories and a host of courts too numerous to count, such as courts of summary jurisdiction which exercise judicial <span class="highlight">powers</span> under laws passed by the Australian Parliament, and courts which have to be taken, according to a decision of the High Court, as they are found for the purpose of the exercise by them of Federal jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it is designed to create a coherent judicial system on a national basis in relation to matters which arise because of the exercise by this Parliament of its legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every time a piece of legislation is introduced which has some impingement, be it great or small, on the so-called rights or so-called <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the States the Opposition raises a cry and opposes the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is designed to transfer <span class="highlight">powers</span> from the States to <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is, as I have said, that difference between the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the Commonwealth has and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the Americans have which makes it unnecessary for us to follow their example. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here is a case in industrial law in Australia where there is a long standing, crying evil due to the fact that we have an equivalent of the American system, that is, 2 different competing systems of law based on different constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> being exercised by State courts and by Federal courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">powers</span> cannot be exercised by the Government until the High Court determines that the Commonwealth Government has the sovereignty and the power to exercise the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are contained in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I would say that the attitudes which he has expressed and the actions which he has taken in relation to the administration of such <span class="highlight">powers</span> as he has under the present laws- the Petroleum and Submerged Lands Act and other Acts which have been passed by this Parliament, namely, the Pipeline Authority Act and the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Act- do not give us any reason to believe that these <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred by this Bill would be wisely exercised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are being asked to do here is to give these vast <span class="highlight">powers</span> to a government and a Minister who in our view have caused some of the most retrograde actions to be taken in relation to the development of our off-shore resources that one could imagine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having seen what he has done and said in regard to oil and gas exploration, why on earth would this Senate, and certainly this Opposition, be expected to give him the sorts of <span class="highlight">powers</span> he is seeking here in regard to the exploration for and the development of minerals generally on the continental shelf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if we were minded in any way to let this legislation pass, we certainly could not be expected to do so when we are so deeply concerned about the way in which the Minister might exercise such <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that his intention is that if he has these sorts of <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to the off-shore areas preference will be given to the Petroleum and Minerals Authority in the selection of the choice areas for exploration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for those general reasons that we are not prepared to give such <span class="highlight">powers</span> as this Bill contains to a Government whose policies are not positive and constructive in these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assume that the spokesman for the Liberal Party had the full consent of his Party when he said that if these <span class="highlight">powers</span> are granted to the Commonwealth they may be misused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a lot of political poppycock, because there are States in this country today misusing the <span class="highlight">powers</span> they already have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The States have ceded <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the central government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How much more is it necessary for the <span class="highlight">powers</span> over resources, over minerals both on-shore and off-shore, to be vested in the central government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is generally regarded as an open question whether the Commonwealth may successfully claim that ‘rights’ or ‘<span class="highlight">powers</span>’- as distinct from duties or obligations- accruing to Australia under international conventions will entitle it to legislate to give effect to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have cited those 2 examples but we can go even more into this interference and how far this Government will go to obtain maximum <span class="highlight">powers</span> by this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the provisions of the Bill the Minister has extensive <span class="highlight">powers</span> whereby he can take unto himself directions in so many ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister may, by instrument in writing, delegate to an officer of the Australian Public Service, either generally or otherwise as provided in the instrument of delegation, all or any of his <span class="highlight">powers</span> or functions under this Act, the Royalty Act or the regulations, except this power of delegation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not even the Minister should give his personal attention to all those matters under section 10 as he can delegate any one of those <span class="highlight">powers</span> to any member of the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, having given to the Government the right to test its constitutional authority to mine for minerals in the off-shore zone, we are unwilling to apply to that off-shore zone- whereas to oil there is a co-operative arrangement with the States, each State administering its own designated area- an administrative patchwork, for other minerals in the same area, that has its origin in the genius of Connor to give directions on any subject notwithstanding the laws of the Australian Capital Territory purported to be applied to it and with the Minister having the right to delegate any of his <span class="highlight">powers</span> to any officer of the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He concentrated on the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of direction given to the Minister, this terrible man whom we have heard castigated before in this chamber-  Mr Connor,  the Minister for Minerals and Energywho has probably done more to protect the interests of Australia in 2 years than any other person has done in the history of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also point out that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister under this Bill are similar to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the petroleum legislation, an Act that  Senator Wright  was prepared to defend during the time that he spoke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the method of appointment of the Magistrate and the fact that he did not have the privileges and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of a royal commission, his report cannot be made public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said on so many occasions, we have endeavoured to obtain <span class="highlight">powers</span> over prices and incomes at the Federal level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is apparent, too, when we look at the legislation that has been passed during the term of this Government, the legislation which was passed during the Joint Sitting of Parliament which has given the Minister for Social Security very wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> for direct control over hospitals, both public and private. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are three particular <span class="highlight">powers</span> to which I refer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has <span class="highlight">powers</span> to determine the registration and deregistration of hospitals under section 132 of the Health Insurance Act 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister is given wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> to determine the nature and function of a hospital under sections 24, 25 and 34 and the Minister has unlimited <span class="highlight">powers</span> of inspection of hospitals and their records under sections 36, 37 and 133. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of some concern to private hospitals in Australia that in respect of those very wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> which I have stated there is no right of appeal against any decisions of the Minister in any of the matters which are subject to his control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will know that in the war years a poster used to go out to define the difference between a democratic society and that of the Axis <span class="highlight">powers</span>- a dictatorship society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These included possible Government involvement in the Australian capital market and industrial structure arising from the proposed additional <span class="highlight">powers</span>, extended functions and privileges of the Australian Industry Development Corporation; the implications for other financial institutions in the money and capital market arising from the financing activities of the AIDC and the NIF; the consequent implications for resource use in the economy and the attainment of other economic and social objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition’s attitude in these circumstances is that in relation to the Bill to amend the Australian Industry Development Corporation Act by extending the Corporation’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions in certain respects- I will deal with that in a moment, despite the fact that we have not had the advantage of the study of the Senate Committee- there could be some merit in these proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second extension of the activities of the AIDC is in relation to its <span class="highlight">powers</span> and here perhaps we ought to register some greater concern at this proposal because it seeks to give the Corporation power to borrow moneys both within and outside Australia, in those broad terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next increase in the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the AIDC is in relation to the establishment of a National Interest Division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the area of the extension of <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the AIDC that gives us on the Opposition side the greatest concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, although the Opposition has very grave reservations about this extension of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the AIDC, we are prepared to let the Bill pass because of the control which will be exercised on any activity of that kind by the Government and the AIDC through the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we look at its performance insofar as the carrying out of its borrowing operations is concerned we find again that it is falling far short of its charter and its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision-making, the <span class="highlight">powers</span>, lie in the private sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition now is in a position, but later than it would have liked, to agree to pass a Bill to expand the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Corporation with the restraints that the Opposition believes are necessary, and always has believed were necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand the Minister has had in mind for some time revising the <span class="highlight">powers</span>, functions and composition of the Australian Dairy Produce Board in order more effectively to meet the present day demands of the market place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The restructuring does not relate so much to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Board because they are currently fairly wide, but the composition is certainly under review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee’s report is designed to define the nature of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> and its place in A.C.T. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an exercise that can only really begin once the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Legislative Assembly and the range of functions to come under its control have been determined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It follows from the Constitutional position, as we understand it, that it is rather for the national Government to retain <span class="highlight">powers</span> unto itself than to prescribe a series of functions to be transferred to local control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our approach has therefore been to determine the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the Commonwealth should retain rather than the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the local assembly should have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were also interested to see that the Commission will no longer have very wide ranging <span class="highlight">powers</span> as it had in the original Bill with regard to the requiring of information so that it may keep itself informed as to the film industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were also pleased to see that the clause with regard to delegation <span class="highlight">powers</span> has been changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compared to those 2 pieces of legislation, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister under the Australian Film Commission Bill are comparatively restricted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the exercise and performance of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the South Australian Film Corporation-  duties functions and authorities the Corporation shall, except where it is required to make a recommendation to the Minister, be subject to the general control and direction of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Primarily we were disposed to try to ensure that the Bill did not in any way encroach upon the rights of existing States and State governments in terms of their own legislature and their own sovereign <span class="highlight">powers</span> over land in terms outlined in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition said then that there were the gravest dangers in giving regulation <span class="highlight">powers</span> to any Government under an Act derived from conventions or treaties made with foreign governments and in particular such treaties being those that have never been tabled in a parliament, debated in a parliament or the derivative legislation from those treaties being made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally, there is some question whether the Government has the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> to go as far as it has gone in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for the establishment of a council of 18 to 24 members to carry out the general function of planning and supervising the development of the arts in Australia and for the establishment of various boards to which the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Council may be delegated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 7 provides that the Council may delegate its <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions and specific tasks and so on to the respective boards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to go off into that area because 1 dare say we will be doing that tomorrow in another Bill that will be before this Parliament, but it ought to be borne in mind that this Government has endeavoured to restrict the increase in the inflation rate to the maximum of its capacity, bearing in mind that it has limitations on its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government does not have complete constitutional power to perform all housing functions, but it does have substantial <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">powers</span> have been used in this Bill to create machinery which will give this Government and its successors a powerful new vehicle, capable if properly directed of fulfilling our national housing aspirations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have been looking at some of these issues in the light of the Senate’s position, ability and <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, I have asked my colleague,  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack, and I hope  Senator Wright  might join later, to make sure for us in the light of their knowledge where the Senate ‘s <span class="highlight">powers</span> in these matters begin and end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking at the Senate as an institution and its financial <span class="highlight">powers</span>, I believe that we ought to regard ourselves continuously as an inspecting House of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But more importantly than that, was it not  Senator Wright,  and I would say  Senator Wood  also, who also opposed this Government’s proposals on income <span class="highlight">powers</span> in 1973? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would not matter,  Mr Deputy President,  with respect, whether a Labor or a Liberal government were in office because if we are going to be effective we would need those <span class="highlight">powers</span> at the Federal level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I am reluctant to take a course which may limit the Senate’s <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not want to do  Senator Cotton  a disservice but I was very interested to see that he introduced this concept of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill that I now present recognises this need in a number of ways, but mainly in providing for the establishment of a strong administrative agency, which will have access to relevant information and effective <span class="highlight">powers</span> to intervene where intervention appears to be desirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Need for Appropriate Investigatory <span class="highlight">Powers</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission will be able to supplement this information by using <span class="highlight">powers</span> which enable it to require information to be furnished on an ad hoc basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would expect that neither the Commission nor the Governor-General would find it necessary to exercise these <span class="highlight">powers</span> except in very special circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is necessary that the legislation provide the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and thereby avoid any possibility, however remote, that a stock exchange might deliberately refuse to take action of its own accord after the need for such action has been established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main purpose of this Bill is to amend certain provisions of the Commonwealth Railways Act 1917-1973 in order to create the Australian National Railways Commission thus providing for the increasingly wider functions and responsibilities of Commonwealth Railways including the transfer of State railways; to ensure that the <span class="highlight">powers</span>, duties and functions of the proposed Commission are, where possible, consistent with other statutory authorities with a similar nature; to make amendments to the Act, which will bring it into line with current commercial practices of statutory authorities; and to overcome administrative problems raised by the Auditor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments will also enable the proposed Commission effectively to perform its role as one of Australia’s major rail systems and provide it with the organisational structure and operational <span class="highlight">powers</span> necessary for it to consolidate into a single system the State railways that may be transferred under the Government’s rail transfer program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently it is essential that the Commission be established now, and be given the necessary structure, <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions for it to operate as an efficient statutory authority charged with making a vital contribution to Australia’s national transport system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within the Bill we find several provisions which give considerable <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are of importance are those which enable the Minister to request an organisation to show why it should not be investigated in relation to specified matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the very wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> and perhaps the intention that these <span class="highlight">powers</span> suggest for the winding up and management of the health funds do lead into an area where, if this Bill were given assent and were enacted, these gaps could not be covered for the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our basic objection to the Bill is, without any question at all, that it does give the Minister absolute and dictatorial <span class="highlight">powers</span> over the operations in the future of the private health funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">powers</span> could be used indiscriminately and for the ultimate or immediate destruction of the health funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I indicate on behalf of the Opposition that at this time we cannot see that it would be in the interests of the Australian public for such wide ranging <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be asserted by the Minister over the operations of the private health funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the following paragraphs the Committee discussed the sort of <span class="highlight">powers</span> which there should be over the funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be said that in some respects the <span class="highlight">powers</span> given to the Minister should have been given in another way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3) to be obnoxious primarily because of the huge <span class="highlight">powers</span> that will be given to the Minister if it is enacted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely this cannot be termed the dictatorial <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The payment of this subsidy is a good reason why the Government should have some overriding supervisory <span class="highlight">powers</span> over the voluntary health system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that the Government should have these <span class="highlight">powers</span> because under the present set-up this is the only way in which the contributors to the voluntary health funds, who are the voters of this country, can get any <span class="highlight">powers</span> or exercise any supervision at all over these funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the fact that the Minister is responsible to the Parliament and that he has to go through judicial procedures to put in a manager is as much a safeguard as you will get in any sort of ministerial <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will claim, no doubt, that it is doing this under the specific <span class="highlight">powers</span> that it has in the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By co-operation and consultation with the States it has all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> necessary to bring in a Bill that will cover all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, at least some of the proposed <span class="highlight">powers</span> are of very dubious constitutional validity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Government is doing is bringing in a monopoly competitor, and that competitor under this Bill would be equipped with very special <span class="highlight">powers</span> to override and to trample down the others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, my own view is that the Commonwealth has gone wider than its direct <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously it aims to set up a large housing corporation that will give to the Canberra bureaucracy <span class="highlight">powers</span> that at present are dis’Lryified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those problems are not solved by the Government transferring a group of people into a new bureaucracy, nominating a sum of money and saying: ‘Now we will do it, and we will do it under some special <span class="highlight">powers</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government does not have complete constitutional power to perform all housing functions, but it does have substantial <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">powers</span> have been used in this Bill to create machinery which will give this Government and its successors a powerful new vehicle, capable if properly directed of fulfilling our national housing aspirations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the proposed legislation goes much further than consolidating the present <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth in that it assumes authority for areas of responsibility which previously were held to be the preserves of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It applies incidental <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the Commonwealth Constitution in a comprehensive and exclusive manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is one of the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> that we have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When entry permits are issued the children will legally become wards of the Minister for Social Security, but in practice his <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions will be undertaken by the State child welfare departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The great thing about the lifting of the cold war is that it suits countries such as Australia and the middle and lesser <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today we have a government that is respected in the Asian area and by the great <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the West. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He scarcely mentioned the role of other communist <span class="highlight">powers</span> in increasing the supply of arms and material to South-East Asia before this invasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third point is that the discretionary character of the many <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are being sought under this Bill suggests that the Bill is designed to secure power just for the sake of having power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is singularly little in the Bill or in the Minister’s second reading speech which explains why <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this wide description are required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should it not be removed as an unwarranted intrusion and not justifiable in the light of all the other <span class="highlight">powers</span> contained in the Bill? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed corporation and exchange commission will have enormous powersfrighteningly wide <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet bit by bit a quite vast array of powerful regulatory legislation is being built up in Canberra giving a variety of bodies a range of <span class="highlight">powers</span> that would have been quite unthought of just a couple of years ago- in fact even now a great many of us are only slowly becoming aware of just how extensive this armoury of <span class="highlight">powers</span> already is- the Prices Justification Tribunal, the Trade Practices Commission and next the Corporations and Exchange Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be argued that governments are entitled to exercise <span class="highlight">powers</span> with regard to the securities industry, with regard to some other industries, and with regard to some operations of the commercial sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to have a transition in this area from exclusive State <span class="highlight">powers</span> to a dual system of regulation or legislation, we believe that the Bill ought to be considered in that context. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said also that this Bill does not provide sufficient rights of appeal against many of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that will exist in the hands of the Corporations and Exchange Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To suggest that there is no complexity in this legislation and to suggest that there could not be confusion would be to overlook all of the views of the States as to the way in which they have needed to co-operate to develop some sort of corporate affairs system which allows them to use their <span class="highlight">powers</span> in co-operation with one another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sorts of things that have been said by honourable senators on this side of the chamber surely are sufficient to enable members of the Government to understand that to place this Bill before the committee is to seek an opportunity to investigate the relationship of the clauses of the Bill, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are debating the Government’s Bill to set up a corporations and exchange commission and to clothe that commission and indeed the Government itself with vast <span class="highlight">powers</span> of investigation and control not only of the whole of the securities industry but also of public corporations throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having said that there ought to be a national regulatory body or a securities commission, the question arises as to the nature of the body that is desirable, what its <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be, how it should operate and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not see a national securities exchange commission as a great bureaucratic structure, floundering around, hamstrung by numerous restrictions, with a vast bureaucracy with great <span class="highlight">powers</span> of penetration into every transaction of the most minute and irrelevant character that may be carried on in the securities industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to speak no longer than to say that I think it should be set out clearly in writing just who the  chairman  of this very important committee will be which will study this Bill designed to institute very wide ranging and new regulatory <span class="highlight">powers</span> if it is passed or in part passed in this parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are additional matters of great importance which such a committee should consider, namely, the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> which may justify this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this Bill in fact exceed the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must never be forgotten that under the Constitution the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that we are concerned with as a national Parliament are those in relation to foreign corporations and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the power of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suggestions have been made- I do not necessarily adopt them but I say that they must surely receive very earnest considerationthat in fact some parts of this Bill and some parts of the regulation of corporations are beyond the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there is the very difficult question, as I see it, to determine where exactly the line is drawn and just exactly what <span class="highlight">powers</span> are needed relating to companies to enable a securities exchange to operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn to another aspect of this Bill- the regulation and rule making <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are contained in the Bill to an enormous degree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill contains not only those general regulation <span class="highlight">powers</span> but also something like 84 clauses under which matters can be prescribed and regulations made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without limiting the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission to transport passengers and goods on the railways, the Commission may transport passengers and goods for reward by land, otherwise than on the railways . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Without limiting the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission to transport passengers and goods on the railways, the Commission may (as incidental or supplementary to, or in association with, the transport of passengers or goods on the railways) transport passengers and goods for reward by land, otherwise than on the railways . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last year, the South Australian Minister for Transport  (Mr Virgo)  was concerned that in any transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span>, standards and facilities might be less than those prevailing at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer now to the nature of the Commission and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are proposed for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should not go over the ground that has been so diligently investigated by the Rae Committee, but taking the report which has been produced, even in the absence of the chapter dealing with Queensland Mines and other recommendations that the Committee was going to make, the parliamentary committee should consider the appropriateness of this Bill to effectuate the purpose that should be given expression to by the Parliament to get stability and integrity in the industry, and to establish as the guardian and the supervisor of the industry with executive <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are effective, a securities and exchange commission for the purposes similar but not coterminous with those of the American legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It said it was satisfied that the interests of this nation’s economy, growth and welfare, as well as the interests of all those persons and corporations, both within and without Australia, who are involved in the securities industry require that the Commonwealth Government exercise the <span class="highlight">powers</span> given to it at Federation to legislate with respect to the securities industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Canada, compulsory evidencegathering <span class="highlight">powers</span> are given to Human Rights Commissions and similar <span class="highlight">powers</span> are vested in the Race Relations Conciliator established by New Zealand legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750415_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The absence of evidencegathering <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the United Kingdom legislation has been said to impede seriously the effectiveness of the Race Relations Board under that legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750415_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> comprise those necessary for the discharge of the functions, including power to arrange for printing and publication of materials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These would be considerable <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be given to an electoral officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not quite sure how extensive his <span class="highlight">powers</span> are in preventing the use of the machines in Western Australia but, clearly, the public generally needs to have a report from the highest level on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750417_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Does this indicate the continuing intention of the Government to deny the Parliament any opportunity of determining the nature, growth and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the regional and other bodies set up under the scheme or their relationship with existing local government bodies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750417_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> and duties  of  the Commission are clearly set out in the agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750417_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that during the course of the rest of this year the Opposition might see wisdom sufficiently to support the Government in its desires to obtain the very important <span class="highlight">powers</span> over prices and incomes which are an essential part of action against the inflationary spiral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Part I contains the usual definitions and provides that the Australian Statistician shall have all the <span class="highlight">powers</span>, functions and duties vested by other Acts in the Commonwealth Statistician. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to the Bureau, the Statistician is vested with all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of, or exercisable by, a permanent head under the Public Service Act 1922-1974, as befits his status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is it not a fact that, under the terms of the Constitution, the Australian Government consists of the 6 States, with limited defined <span class="highlight">powers</span> residing with the Commonwealth Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They consciously surrendered a number of sovereign <span class="highlight">powers</span>, including control of customs and excise duties and other functions of national significance including defence, immigration, currency and coinage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major step towards ultimate domination by the Commonwealth of the States’ financial power came with the uniform tax scheme of 1942, which the High Court then upheld as a wartime measure and 15 years later again upheld under peacetime <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both the Postal and the Telecommunications Commissions will be large property owners, and the Bills provide the necessary <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to property transactions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill empowers the Commission to enter any property, either public or private, for the purpose of carrying out surveys or making any other examinations or tests and also empowers the Commission to construct lines and associated equipment such as conduits, cable pits and junction boxes on such property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More extensive <span class="highlight">powers</span> are to be found at present in the Post and Telegraph Act and the exercise of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> is generally not subject to written prior notice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister is given similar <span class="highlight">powers</span> of appointment for officers of the Overseas Telecommunications Commission who will be appointed to the Australian Telecommunications Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was to ensure that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board had adequate <span class="highlight">powers</span> to carry out its functions effectively to ensure that adequate and comprehensive programs are presented by the licensees of commercial broadcasting and television stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the legal advice provided to the Government, it appears that the Board may not have sufficient <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the existing Act to properly carry out the functions entrusted to it by Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the circumstances, I believe I should explain that what the Government proposed on that occasion, and still proposes today, is that in the Committee stage of the Bill, an amendment should be moved to ensure that the Parliament itself should have direct supervision over the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Broadcasting Control Board- or the Broadcasting Authority, as it is suggested it should be renamed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Specifically, it is proposed that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be granted to the Authority to determine rules and standards for programs, conditions for advertisements, and the hours of transmission of stations are to be subject to a provision that they may only be exercised in the same way as regulationsthat is, that any such determinations must first be laid on the table of both Houses of the Parliament, and may then be subject to disallowance by either House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply remind senators firstly that it is designed to clarify the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Broadcasting Control Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There shall be an Inter-State Commission, with such <span class="highlight">powers</span> of adjudication and administration as the Parliament deems necessary for the execution and maintenance, within the Commonwealth, of the provisions of this Constitution relating to trade and commerce, and of all laws made thereunder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The deliberations which led to the drafting of the Constitution envisaged the role of the Commission as being complementary to Parliament, the Executive and the judiciary and the existence of a body of such stature, with wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> to deal with the interests of all parties involved in or affected by, transport, has been a persuasive argument in leading the Government to this decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> given to the Inter-State Commission included <span class="highlight">powers</span> of investigation over a very wide range of matters going well beyond matters relating to inter-state trade or commerce and power to determine a great variety of disputes, including disputes as to preferences or disadvantages given or made by any State or by any common carrier in contravention of the Act or the provisions of the Constitution relating to trade and commerce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission was given wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> to grant relief to the parties before it and was empowered to grant injunctions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The High Court, by a majority, held that section 101 of the Constitution did not authorise the establishment of the Inter-State Commission as a court and therefore the provisions of Part V conferring judicial <span class="highlight">powers</span> upon the Inter-State Commission were invalid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There shall be an Inter-State Commission, with such <span class="highlight">powers</span> of adjudication and administration as the Parliament deems necessary for the execution and maintenance, within the Commonwealth, of the provisions of this Constitution relating to trade and commerce, and of all laws made thereunder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission, with its wide investigatory <span class="highlight">powers</span>, will be an expert body well suited to provide advice to governments on such planning issues, and the Australian Government would expect that State governments will also be anxious to avail themselves of its services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill is divided into six parts- Part 1, Preliminary; Part II, Constitution of the Inter-State Commission; Part III, Regulation of, and <span class="highlight">Powers</span> of Commission in relation to, Trade and Commerce; Part IV, Investigations by Commission; Part V, Administrative Provisions relating to the Commission, and Part VI, Miscellaneous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By virtue of Clause 13, regulations may authorise the Commission to exercise statutory <span class="highlight">powers</span> of other authorities or tribunals under any trade and commerce law, subject to the specified conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 14 sets forth the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission to hold investigations, which the Government sees as the essential first step in the process leading to adjudications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A wide range of subject matter could be investigated, including: any matters relevant to, or affected by, the provisions of the Constitution relating to trade and commerce (including matters relating to the operation and effect of laws and practices of the States) wilh a view to considering the necessity for new laws, or changes to existing laws, of Australia under the provisions of the Constitution relating to trade and commerce; any matters in respect of which an adjudication by the Commission is relevant to the operation of the provisions of this Bill; any matters relevant to the operation of Clause 1 1 ; and any matters in respect of which the Commission is authorised to exercise <span class="highlight">powers</span> in pursuance of Clause 13. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other parts of Clause 14 provide that the Commission may exercise its <span class="highlight">powers</span> to hold an investigation on its own initiative or at the direction of the Minister, who may also extend an investigation by the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any person, including a State, may request the Commission to exercise those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Powers</span> of the Commission to make orders are provided by Clause 16; and under Sub-Clause 16 (3) the Commission will have power to make orders if necessary following action pursuant to Sub-Clause 14(10), that is to say, in regard to pricing guidelines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 1 7 provides for other <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission including, but not limited to, the issuance of licences or requirement of the Commission’s consent in regard to the engaging in, or the use of aircraft, vessels, vehicles or pipelines in inter-state transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is provision in the Bill for regulatory <span class="highlight">powers</span> and for penalties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course we are confronted with a position in a socalled free enterprise society in which a government has very limited <span class="highlight">powers</span> and opportunities to control the private sector of the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course this Government has taken quite energetic steps to see that capital inflow is restricted to exercise as much restraint as is within the <span class="highlight">powers</span> provided by the Constitution to control the money supply within the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one indicts the Minister for Foreign Affairs, as this motion seeks to do, one also indicts the Prime Minister because the complaint of the Opposition is not as to what precise words were used but that in its dealings with warring foreign <span class="highlight">powers</span> Australia has favoured one side against the other, at least diplomatically, and that is where this motion falls down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For better or for worse, any government is entitled to its biases, in this case its sympathy is with the communist aims of North Vietnam, but it has the obligation of fully justifying this to the people whom it represents in its dealings with foreign <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The opportunity will also be taken to strengthen the Government’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> to protect Australian industry against the practices of dumping and subsidisation of imported goods, in the light of experience gained with the existing Act, the Customs Tariff (Dumping and Subsidies) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This obviously is an area which is in need of greater assistance and greater recognition, and it will come only through the establishment of a proper commission, not just a commission such as the Government has in mind, of an advisory nature, but one which has substantial <span class="highlight">powers</span> to determine where the real needs are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under section 5 1 and other sections of the Constitution there is a claim that for migrants, for defence Services and for a few other things incidental to the various <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth we can supply legal aid, but legal aid generally to the ordinary citizenry for State purposes must be channelled, under the Constitution, by section 96. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is ironic that members of the Opposition should castigate the Government for the efforts it has made to try to restrain the increase in incomes in this country because when in 1 973 we saw the danger arising and sought <span class="highlight">powers</span> over prices and incomes we were opposed by the Opposition and by misguided sections of the trade union movement whose motives I would say would have been about as suspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Government to investigate the possibility of arranging with the Tasmanian Government to widen the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this Commission to enable it to be a bridge commission for the Derwent or something of that sort, because that is the way suitable bridges were built in the HalifaxDartmouth area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I think the best thing I can do is to refer him to clause (g) of the agreement which states that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and capacities of the Commission shall include power, authority and capacity- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We note also that there are provisions for enforcement which give enormous <span class="highlight">powers</span> to a <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It provides for a Commissioner of Community Relations to exercise coercive <span class="highlight">powers</span> to endeavour to persuade a person to settle a matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commissioner is granted under this Bill <span class="highlight">powers</span> of enormous scope so that if his attempts at settling an issue do not meet with the success which he himself believes they should meet with, he can then institute court proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be regarded as totally unfair, and as we know the person in whom these <span class="highlight">powers</span> are vested- he is on the public record as having expressed views which might make those who could come within his surveillance regard him as prejudiced against them- it is completely unreasonable that he should have these wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> vested in him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the reasons I have expressed this is not to suggest that the fact that  Mr Grassby  is the person who would hold these <span class="highlight">powers</span> is the fundamental reason that these <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be denied to an official. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Irrespective of who the person is, it is a dangerous precedent to grant <span class="highlight">powers</span> of such wide scope to any government official. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A third way, and it is the way in which the Opposition will be proposing, is to provide for conciliation to be attempted by the Commissioner but to deny to the Commissioner any coercive <span class="highlight">powers</span>, except one, with regard to the method of conciliation which he will be able to attempt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What the Government is doing is relying upon the fact that there is an international convention for the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination which Australia is ratifying and which, because of the obligations which it is said flow from that ratification, enables it to exercise its <span class="highlight">powers</span> to make laws with respect to external affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When that person comes before him very extensive <span class="highlight">powers</span> can be exercised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that, apart from the power to have a conference at which the effort at conciliation can be made, these <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be removed from the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is unbelievable that we should find a former Attorney-General of the previous administration castigating this Government for utilising the external <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the Constitution to ratify an international document to which his Government put its signature on 13 October 1966, having taken something like 10 months to make up its mind about what it should do in relation to a convention agreed to by the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A court having decided to exercise those special <span class="highlight">powers</span> not to record a conviction, it seems to me to be very harsh that that matter can then be taken into account in the disciplinary actions that will be taken by the person’s employer, the Commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me realistic that at the time of considering the formation of the Commission, we ought to be considering these wide <span class="highlight">powers</span>, to have an interpretation from the Government to see how it sees the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that it has expressed in the Bill, and not wait for the Commission to evolve over time and in the light of experience the functions that it will accept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, the fact that it relates to transport, that it will have wide <span class="highlight">powers</span>, <span class="highlight">powers</span> that it can impose on any other government body lead us to ask how it will affect the Air Navigation Act 1920-1974 and regulations under that Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another clause to which I wish to refer is clause 13, which provides for regulations for the Commission to exercise certain statutory <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 14 vests the Commission with extraordinarily wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> to hold investigations, and under sub-clause (3) of that clause it may exercise these <span class="highlight">powers</span> on its own initiative or at the request of any other person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an unmistakeable intention, we believe, to give the Commission <span class="highlight">powers</span> to make orders that have the force of law and, therefore, which could override both Federal and State laws and any contracts which would relate to such legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not one that has the <span class="highlight">powers</span> in this Bill which could be imposed by the proposed Inter-State Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I consider that these matters are consistent with our approach where we say we ought to have time to find expression from the Government about its intention, what <span class="highlight">powers</span> the Commission will use, and how it may best be developed as an Inter-State Commission which could be used for the purposes which we all accept as being valid ones- to improve the transport systems throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would allow an expression of views from those people in the community who wish to express their interpretation of the legislation, from the people who have to work within the legislation and from the State governments which find great threats to the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> which they wish to exercise in matters relating to transport within their own States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To suggest that all of these matters can be summarily dismissed to an Inter-State Commission with the sweeping <span class="highlight">powers</span> that this Commission would have, I think warrants the deeper consideration of the Senate, and I commend the proposal made by the Leader of the Opposition to all honourable senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter of an Inter-State Commission has been the subject of long debate in this country ever since the original Commission became redundant as a result of the challenge that flowed from what is known as the wheat case in which the judical <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the then Inter-State Commission were challenged in the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Transport  (Mr Charles Jones)  in his second reading speech made it quite clear that the Government intends to exercise these <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission only in the transport area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be misleading, I believe, to suggest that the formation of the Inter-State Commission would not to some degree take from the States some <span class="highlight">powers</span>, but it would be in the national interest to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part III of the legislation, which deals with the regulation of, and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission in relation to, trade and commerce, gives <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Commission and describes those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very important to realise that the Commission will not be a body which will simply please itself and do exactly what it likes, despite the fact that it is given fairly wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> of investigation on its own initiative, and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of investigation which may be initiated by the Minister or another person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the legislation before us we find that it gives enormous <span class="highlight">powers</span> to this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Federal Labor Government will promptly restore the machinery the Constitution intended and vest it with the Commonwealth ‘s full constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> to plan and provide modern means of communications between the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who know anything about the formulators of the Constitution will appreciate that the State governments which enjoyed the sovereign <span class="highlight">powers</span> then surrendered only those <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Commonwealth which were necessary for the effective functioning of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note- this is probably beyond  Senator Maunsell  ‘s <span class="highlight">powers</span> of comprehensionthe attitude the Liberals took during that period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In clothing the Commission with these extensive <span class="highlight">powers</span>, we have not gone beyond that which is proper or which honourable members opposite, when in office, considered to be so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to exercise all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that a Royal Commission exercises, and we have included in the Bill such <span class="highlight">powers</span> as are necessary to make the investigation effective . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is futile to clothe a body like this Inter-State Commission with wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> of inquiry if they are to be baffled, and their inquiries rendered nugatory, by the refusal of witnesses to answer questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission will have wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> of inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will have wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> to investigate and wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> to make recommendations in respect of a modern transport system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it will have wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> both of administration and adjudication in relation to Inter-State carriers, railways, shipping, and other matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have never ceased from that day to this to urge, and urge again, that in the Inter-State Commission we have a source of power, or, perhaps, to be more correct, a searchlight, by whose help we can exercise Commonwealth <span class="highlight">powers</span> with far greater certainty of success than by any other mode open to us … <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why did the previous Government exercise its <span class="highlight">powers</span> and carry out a number of inquiries into transportation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only question for this Parliament should be what are the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the InterState Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, in our Constitution section 102 provided that there shall be an Inter-State Commission with such <span class="highlight">powers</span> of adjudication and administration as the Parliament deems necessary for the execution and maintenance of the constitutional provisions and laws of trade and commerce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that situation, where it was necessary to weld together 6 separately existing colonies, with their own governments, and a new national government with these <span class="highlight">powers</span>, surely it was not only sensible from the point of view of history but also on any theory of government to require the establishment of a pseudo-judicial executive body to form an Inter-State Commission with <span class="highlight">powers</span> of adjudication and administration such as Parliament thought necessary to maintain and execute the federal laws, including the Constitution, relating to trade and commerce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That brings me to the Bill which is being presented to us- a Bill which clothes the Commission directed to be established by the Constitution with <span class="highlight">powers</span> that should be confined to adjudication and administration for the maintenance and execution of the trade and commerce laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think there would be anybody on this side of the House who would think that transport, in all its aspects, should not have the proper attention of the Inter-State Commission with proper <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, instead of shipping services around the coast being held up by unforgivable interruptions, we will nave an improvement due to the adoption by the Parliament of a Bill with proper <span class="highlight">powers</span> establishing the Inter-State Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be a body set up by the Constitution, and if it is clothed with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> to enable it to maintain and execute the industrial laws affecting trade and commerce, what a boon it will be to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For my part, the Inter-State Commission, having been conceived as the body to be the eyes and ears of the Government obviously should have proper <span class="highlight">powers</span> of investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The curious thing about the amendments foreshadowed by  Senator Wright  is that they throw up the difference between the Government and the Opposition as to what the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Inter-State Commission should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an interesting reflection that more than 75 years ago the thinking amongst the leading political figures should have been not whether there should be an Inter-State Commission but what its <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be and the extent of the independence that it should enjoy from the government and any arm of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course some legislation will be necessary to regulate (its) <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it now appears from the tenor of this debate that the main issue between the Opposition and the Government is not the establishment of the Commission- that seems to be accepted as necessary- but the extent of its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is natural that there should be disagreement between the parties as to the extent of the <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until the Parliament provides for the number of members and their salary, the Commission cannot exist at all, and until the Parliament determines what <span class="highlight">powers</span> of adjudication and administration are necessary to it, it can have no <span class="highlight">powers</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliament cannot, of course, be compelled- except by its constituents- to constitute a Commission or to give it any <span class="highlight">powers</span> when constituted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The imperative words of this section, however, receive some support from that fact that S. 102 will be inoperative until such a Commission is constituted and given certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> of adjudicating as to preferences and discriminations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that those precedents do not throw any light on what ought to be the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this Commission in 1 975 and for the rest of this century and beyond. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ought to realise that in Australia we suffer from the grave disability that the central government, the Federal government- call it what you like- has completely inadequate economic <span class="highlight">powers</span>, so much so that in December of 1973 it went to the people to obtain a constitutional change to give it power with respect to incomes and prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was left as a body with only investigatory <span class="highlight">powers</span> and incidental quasi-judicial <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On no basis of power did the Opposition, when in government during that period of thirteen to fourteen years, move in any way to re-establish the body which it now says ought to be an integral part of the national economy of Australia, provided the <span class="highlight">powers</span> are right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely, then, it is simply a question of the nature and the extent of the <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is acknowledged that there will be differences between 2 political parties with respect to what is considered proper as the nature and extent of the <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I strongly suspect that the Opposition is waiting until it can collate and correlate all the objections it gets to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this Commission from the interests which it represents- the vested interests involved in trade and commerce, the vested interests involved in transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is just a question of what the Commission’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> ought to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Commission has been, in practice and in effect, a dead body for some 60 years- since 1950 it has been completely legally dead- as the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Review which met from 1957 to 1959 reported that there should be an Inter-State Commission, and after all the references, including the report of the Senate Select Committee on Off-shore Petroleum resources which some years ago contained a similar recommendation, surely the Opposition is able to crystallise its thinking by tonight or tomorrow as to what the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since it is simply a question of what the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission ought to be, and since it is a question that the Government sees the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are contained in this Bill as proper, I should imagine there would be circumstances in which the Government would be prepared to accept amendments moved by the Opposition so long as they did not make the Commission a completely toothless tiger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> can be built up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Withers  who led for the Opposition in this debate expressed his perplexity as to what the <span class="highlight">powers</span> given in clause 17 involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that all that clause 17 does is to complete by enumeration through different clauses the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clause in itself does not confer any new <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as I am concerned, if the Parliament crosses out clause 17 there is no harm done to the structure of the Commission or to its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When there are given <span class="highlight">powers</span> that go far beyond transport, of course, we ought to assume that in the course of time the Commission will be operating in a wider field than transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is simply a question of what the Commission’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> ought to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill, likewise, is a complex one because it involves the very grave question of the extent of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are obscured in its present phraseology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also provides that the Parliament may confer upon the Commission <span class="highlight">powers</span> of adjudication and administration for the execution and maintenance of the provisions of the Constitution relating to trade and commerce and laws made thereunder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most important question, and this is the only point on which I could agree with  Senator Everett,  involves the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the functions of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like  Senator Wright,  I accept that there is probably good cause for re-establishing this body, but the important questions in my mind are what its <span class="highlight">powers</span> shall be and to what extent it will operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the years people have raised the matter, but now we have before us for the first time a Bill which has to be determined in relation to its terms and <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this another way to increase the Government’s <span class="highlight">powers</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>After 55 years we have a Bill brought into this Parliament, and this is the first opportunity we have had to see the terms of it and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> given under it to this proposed institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not just a matter in this case of taking <span class="highlight">powers</span> from the States by introducing a Commission of this nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It depends upon the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There shall be an Inter-State Commission, with such <span class="highlight">powers</span> of adjudication and administration as the Parliament deems necessary for the execution and maintenance, within the Commonwealth, of the provisions of this Constitution relating to trade and commerce, and of all laws made thereunder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, it is an institution which was contemplated at the time of the foundation of the Australian Parliament when the <span class="highlight">powers</span> were allocated between the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the report of the debate which took place on this Bill in the House of Representatives one finds references by Opposition speakers to the possible <span class="highlight">powers</span> and how they might be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A commission which has wide investigatory <span class="highlight">powers</span> to look into questions of malpractice and at ways of making interstate trade more efficient was the original and real intention of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But obviously there are different views and there may be a gradation of views which we will need to consider at length before we come to a final decision as to what shall be the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that the State governments certainly have an interest and a right to be heard in relation to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that would be ascribed to this body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also have to consider the extent of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and how they would affect bodies such as Trade Practices Commission, the Prices Justification Tribunal and other bodies which the Commonwealth Government has seen fit to set up, and to determine to what extent they should be overridden in any fields of power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trade and commerce is the area which is covered by the <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the Constitution, and this may well be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not suggest for one moment that I have read enough and that I am satisfied that I know sufficient of the history and sufficient of the complex position in transport today to say yet how far the <span class="highlight">powers</span> should go; but it does seem to me at the present time that in relation to Tasmania some specific <span class="highlight">powers</span> may well be very desirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After proceeding to look at the Bill and the <span class="highlight">powers</span>, it makes specific reference to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of investigation which it appears to feel are strong and, I think, adequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Commission will have to live within the Constitution it can, and probably will, exert such a fundamental influence, in view of its extremely wide <span class="highlight">powers</span>, on the trade and commerce of this country as to be capable of surpassing the influence of the States and other Federal institutions or bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a concern amongst many people that we may give to this Commission <span class="highlight">powers</span> which will enable it in effect to legislate, and this may be part of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that we should not give. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Constitution it is the duty of this Parliament to deem what is necessary for the execution and maintenance of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> and we cannot pass up the consideration or let it be hurried past our eyes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not say for one moment that at this stage I feel that we are in a position to delineate those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Everett,  myself and others have had a good deal of opportunity in the year we have been in this place to see investigation by committees of this Parliament of <span class="highlight">powers</span> contained in clauses which are hardly appreciated in the course of discussion in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we do this, if we take into account the changes that have occurred in the period for which this body has been out of existence and the bodies that exist in this Commonwealth today and if we produce a Bill with limited <span class="highlight">powers</span> but <span class="highlight">powers</span> that will be useful, then we will have done our job as administrators and as legislators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There shall be an Inter-State Commission, with such <span class="highlight">powers</span> of adjudication and administration as the Parliament deems necessary for the execution and maintenance, within the Commonwealth, of the provisions of this Constitution relating to trade and commerce, and of all laws made thereunder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission and the Constitution gives wide <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> embraced in this Bill are the <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the Constitution as set out in the particular section of the Constitution which says that this proposition is to be implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course clause 14, about which  Senator Guilfoyle  was much concerned, relates only to the Commission’s investigatory <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is seeking to establish an Inter-State Commission, saying that it will perform one thing and in fact giving it <span class="highlight">powers</span> which will enable it to do a host of other things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) The regulations may authorize the Commission, either generally or otherwise as provided by the regulations, to exercise all or any of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> (other than judicial <span class="highlight">powers</span>) of any authority or tribunal under any law of Australia made under the provisions of the Constitution relating to trade and commerce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where regulations so authorizing the Commission to exercise any <span class="highlight">powers</span> of an authority or tribunal are in force- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Commission may exercise the <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the extent provided for by the regulations; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the authority or tribunal is not entitled to exercise the <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the extent to which the Commission is authorized to exercise the <span class="highlight">powers</span>; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for the purpose of enabling the Commission to exercise the <span class="highlight">powers</span> in accordance with the regulations, or for purposes connected with or arising out of the exercise of those <span class="highlight">powers</span> by the Commission, the law under which the <span class="highlight">powers</span> were previously exercisable by the authority or tribunal has effect subject to such modifications (if any) as are prescribed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those regulations may authorise the Commission to exercise all or any of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of any authority or tribunal under any law of <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has said that the Commonwealth can justify, as a law made within its <span class="highlight">powers</span>, any law which can be sustained under any head of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If such regulations are made the effect is that the Inter-State Commission will be able to exercise all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of those bodies which are conferred upon it by the regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be able to exercise the <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred on the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to the extent that it has trade and commerce <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be able to exercise the <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred on the Prices Justification Tribunal, the Trade Practices Commission, the Australian National Airlines Commission or any of those other bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the extent that the Commission is given those <span class="highlight">powers</span> by regulation the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, the Trade Practices Commission, the Prices Justification Tribunal and all those other bodies are denied the opportunity or the right to exercise those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is absolutely ridiculous for this Parliament to accept that this power should exist in the hands of an Inter-State Commission without vastly more consideration than has been able to be given to it and with absolutely no public examination, as I see it, of the impact of those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, if one looks at the last limb of this provision, one sees that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which were previously exercised by the tribunal or authority can be modified by regulation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, it does not matter what the Parliament has said should be the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Industries Assistance Commission, under this legislation regulations can transfer the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of that Commission to the Inter-State Commission and, furthermore, can modify, in effect, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we would have a commission that would have certain investigatory, adjudicatory and arbitrary <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government, in bringing in a Bill to establish a commission where none exists now, very recklessly clothes the Commission with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which have been described quite fully by members of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that if the Government were serious in asking for the co-operation of the Opposition in this matter it would have brought in <span class="highlight">powers</span> which were limited to the purposes outlined in the second reading speech and if it were necessary to extend the <span class="highlight">powers</span> later the Government would ask Parliament for that extension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Everett  has argued for the fullest of <span class="highlight">powers</span> and used a comparison with the defeat of the referendums in relation to prices and incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, as a very effective spokesman for the Government in the Senate, he has established his belief that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> need to be as wide as they are stated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whist I am the first to admit that he is a very persuasive  speaker,  he did not say, under quite respectful questioning by interjection, why the <span class="highlight">powers</span> were needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has outlined a limited role, but put into this chamber a Bill with extraordinary <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was interested in the criticism of  Senator Wright’s  statement about union matters and his desire to move amendments which would bring within the orbit of the investigations and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission actions of the unions in relation to transport matters in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has simply said, through its senior spokesmen, that it requires all the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are outlined in this Bill, for a very limited usage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously the Commission, because of the limited nature of its constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>, will not go as far as that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aspect of the Bill which concerns me more than anything else is the Commission’s obvious legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Greenwood  has already very carefully analysed and set out the ambit of clause 13, whereby regulations may be made authorising the Commission to exercise all or any of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of any authority or tribunal under any law of Australia relating to trade and commerce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my mind that is exercising <span class="highlight">powers</span> which would normally be- and I would require to be- exercised by Parliament itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parliament in which he has indicated that the Government wants to experiment with this Bill to see what its <span class="highlight">powers</span> are, that it is starting off in the transport sphere and that it hopes there will be favourable High Court decisions in relation to the exercise of some of its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There shall be an Inter-State Commission, with such <span class="highlight">powers</span> of adjudication and administration as the Parliament deems necessary - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am prepared to support the creation of an Inter-State Commission which has some <span class="highlight">powers</span> of adjudication- they may be very limited <span class="highlight">powers</span> of adjudication because of High Court decisions -and which is designed to execute and maintain the laws which are made by this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can also see perhaps a greater purpose in this day and age for an Inter-State Commission as a body conducting investigations in this whole field of transport throughout Australia, making submissions and recommendations to government as to what the laws ought to be or how they ought to be executed and perhaps what body should be given <span class="highlight">powers</span> of execution in addition to or in conjunction with the Commission itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am certainly not prepared to support an Inter-State Commission which will have the <span class="highlight">powers</span> given to it by Part III of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that further time is necessary for honourable senators to give a great deal more thought and attention to what should be the <span class="highlight">powers</span>, functions and objects of an Inter-State Commission in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wright  has suggested some <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the Inter-State Commission should have particularly in regard to Tasmania and he put forward a clear proposal, which one can readily understand, as to what the Commission should do and the abuses that its <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be designed to remedy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, the State governments are vitally concerned with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that might be given to such a body as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true, of course, that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the proposed Inter-State Commission are to be confined to interstate trade and are not to impinge upon the States’ area of trade within the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore any <span class="highlight">powers</span> we might consider giving to this body should be fully discussed with the State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any proposed <span class="highlight">powers</span> for this Commission should be fully discussed with them and their ideas about how the Inter-State Commission could work should be sought and should be respected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There shall be an Inter-State Commission, with such <span class="highlight">powers</span> of adjudication and administration as the Parliament deems necessary for the execution and maintenance, within the Commonwealth, of the provisions of this Constitution relating to trade and commerce, and of all laws made thereunder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard from speakers on the other side who have said that they do not now contest the view that there ought to be an interstate commission, but they would prefer to see some weak administrative organisation or tribunal emasculated as to <span class="highlight">powers</span> although they understand clearly that the Government wants to have a commission with <span class="highlight">powers</span> which in the first instance can be applied in the area of transport but not hiding the fact that in relation to some other areas those <span class="highlight">powers</span> may be availed of when the Government’s experience and the Commission’s experiences are better established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There shall be an Inter-State Commission, with such <span class="highlight">powers</span> of adjudication and administration as the Parliament deems necessary for the execution and maintenance, within the Commonwealth, of the provisions of this Constitution relating to trade and commerce, and of all laws made thereunder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commission cannot operate under other <span class="highlight">powers</span> without further legislation or regulations, all of which are in the power of the Parliament to check. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both  Senator Greenwood  and  Senator Durack  referred to clause 10 and said that they were very concerned at the extent of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> contained in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This allows the transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred on other bodies insofar as those <span class="highlight">powers</span> are made under the provisions of the Constitution relating to trade and commerce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much argument has developed on this, including an argument from, I think,  Senator Greenwood,  who talked about the use which might be made of <span class="highlight">powers</span> in, for example, the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He should know that the general <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission rely upon the very special constitutional basis provided for in section 51 (xxxv) of the Constitution, and he will also know that this is not a provision of the Constitution relating to trade and commerce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I enter the debate only because I interpret this agreement as being indicative of a maturity of relations between a small power and super <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, when what was known as the Cold War era developed, there was a tendency to be with either the goodies or the baddies, and if people in what constituted the Western democracies- countries like Australia and Canada- had the temerity to question detail about the super <span class="highlight">powers</span>, their loyalty could have been in doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think even a former Prime Minister,  Mr McMahon,  had to exercise his sovereign <span class="highlight">powers</span> about United States nuclear naval craft coming here if there was an element of danger that there could be some serious catastrophe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I only wanted to make the point that the present Australian Government, with its mature relationship in dealing with London, Washington, the Soviet Union and other lesser <span class="highlight">powers</span>, has proved what can be achieved by conciliation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has made the point that if there is to be a nuclear brawl between the 2 super <span class="highlight">powers</span> of China and the Soviet Union we could be caught up in the action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It provides the Commissioner with power to subpoena witnesses for purposes of conciliation and inquiry and it provides the Commissioner also with <span class="highlight">powers</span> to levy penalties against people who refuse to answer subpoenas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the fact that there are no Australian children’s television programs on commercial television between 4 p.m. and 6.30 p.m., when the majority of viewers are children, would the Minister encourage the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to use its <span class="highlight">powers</span> to initiate a public hearing on the question of Australian children’s television programs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the greatest advantages of the conciliation procedure is that it encourages the specific performance of obligations, especially in relation to employment and housing, which apart from statutory <span class="highlight">powers</span> the courts may be reluctant to enforce . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill should be more concisely drawn in relation to the way in which it will operate in order to ensure that the Commission operates only within the Commonwealth’s constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be that there are some in the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union at present who use the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are conferred upon trade unions by our beneficent laws to get the power of the work force that they represent behind them in order to prosecute the class war even to the extent of overthrowing the present system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply use this opportunity to reflect on the definition of ‘trade union training’ and on the question of how widely the reference to ‘the <span class="highlight">powers</span>, functions and duties of officers or officials of trade unions’ in clause 3 of this Bill will be interpreted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is in the hands of perhaps one or two unions in this country an ability excessively to use certain <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also involves educational, technical and practical training which is capable of advancing and developing knowledge and skills in fields connected with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions of trade unions or the <span class="highlight">powers</span>, functions and duties of officers or officials of trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I understood what  Senator Hall  said tonight it was to emphasise the fact that there are elements within the trade union movement which would use the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and objectives of this Trade Union Training Authority to stimulate a desire and an equipment and an ability amongst more and more trade unionists to overthrow the existing society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason for this was that the arbitration system was no longer effective, particularly after the penal <span class="highlight">powers</span> were paralysed in 1969, as a means of imposing wage standards and other standards on workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>( 1 ) A council may, either generally or otherwise as provided by a resolution of the council, delegate to a member of the council or to an officer of the Authority any of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this Act, other than this power of delegation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition proposes, by its amendments, that the Senate should agree to retaining those unlawful provisions and moderating the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the commissioner in respect of their enforcement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commissioner has very wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that those <span class="highlight">powers</span> do not sit easily with the rule of law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are <span class="highlight">powers</span> that can be greatly abused by threatening or qualifying a person’s rights at law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore all the more important that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are given to the Commissioner are <span class="highlight">powers</span> that do sit easily with people’s rights at law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is etirely appropriate that there should not <span class="highlight">powers</span> that could be used in a way that mig amount to satisfying a private vengeance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the purposes of this inquiry the Commissioner has a number of coercive <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That to us is one of the very real problems that these <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commissioner involve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That sort of power of intimidation in an atmosphere of compulsion which attends the exercise of the Commissioner’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> is we believe a denial of right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this area of racial discrimination, where we are making a start in this country with regard to a comprehensive law of this character, we believe it is tremendously important to tread carefully and not in an over-zealous pursuit of enforcement <span class="highlight">powers</span> to create the possibility of a backlash that would do more harm in the long run than good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of the Bill are either good or bad in their own right We agree that the prime function of the Commissioner should be to act as a conciliator, but with respect we suggest that he also needs the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which we seek to confer on him by this sub-clause for the simple reason that he will frequently be dealing with aggrieved persons who are intimidated by the notion of taking a matter to law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not say fundamentally that it has none, but I think we should be tremendously careful before we put these <span class="highlight">powers</span> into legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Senate removed similar <span class="highlight">powers</span> from a Bill called the Law Reform Commission Bill because it did not seem to be appropriate legislation in which these <span class="highlight">powers</span> should appear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister will recall that I asked him a question this morning about how <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this character had been exercised under the Trade Practices Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He indicated that he would ascertain from the Attorney-General  (Mr Enderby)  the precise circumstances in which those <span class="highlight">powers</span> were exercised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should these <span class="highlight">powers</span> be exercised under this legislation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should never be forgotten that coercive <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this character are given to a Commissioner when the <span class="highlight">powers</span> possessed by the police forces of this country in the investigation of serious crime are not as extensive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No police officer is entitled to require a person to answer questions or to produce documents, and when that situation prevails it is generally accepted that there is added justification for being cautious in giving wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> to statutory officers or to members of the bureaucracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances, looking at the general <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the Commissioner has and accepting the broad approach which the Opposition proposes to reduce the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commissioner so that he is essentially a conciliator and an educator, as  Senator Chaney  indicated, we believe that this clause should not be in the Bill and we shall therefore oppose it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not have the <span class="highlight">powers</span> in England, and that is to the cost of the legislation there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have them in Canada and New Zealand and, of course, in other legislation in this Parliament, legislation introduced by both sides of politics, there is no absence of compulsory evidence gathering <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am at a loss to understand that there is something altogether novel about this clause- that it is something unknown to our law- which derogates from human rights when, as we have seen, the legislature on so many occasions has judged that there be compulsory evidence gathering <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred on various authorities and tribunals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reasonableness of the Minister’s utterances ought not to cloak the enormity of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> being sought in this context. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have indicated that there can always be particular areas in which <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this sort may be justified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is that sort of feeling which was behind the question I asked of the Minister this morning about the use of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the Trades Practices Act to invade a person’s premises and to seize documents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No objection seems to be taken from time to time to learned judges being cloaked with all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of sniffers-out in various royal commissions that are held, several of which are proceeding now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do they suggest, for example, that conferring the sort of <span class="highlight">powers</span> about which we are talking on the Income Tax Commissioner turns him into some kind of Star Chamber or makes him some sort of reprehensible snifferout? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we are getting altogether too carried away in imputing to this particular clause the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of a Star Chamber or of a sniffer-out which will in some way or other make people’s lives miserable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that Parliamentary Counsel, under the traditional <span class="highlight">powers</span> which he has to tidy up legislation in areas such as this, would remove the Part and just leave this as a separate clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was inserted into that Act some years ago in order to facilitate the utilisation of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and to ensure the enforcement of union rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I find it incongruous that  Senator Wright,  who saw fit to oppose my amendment to clause 49, should now give voice to the fears he has about the wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wonder what the distinction is between the provisions in the Queensland legislation which will be affected by the amendment with which we are now dealing and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are given to the Administration in the Northern Territory under the Social Welfare Ordinance to give directions and make orders as to who shall go onto and who shall leave a reserve in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I notice that in clause 4 of this Bill the Australian Statistician is to have the functions, <span class="highlight">powers</span> and duties expressed by the Census and Statistics Act 1905-1973, by any other Act, or by any regulations or other instrument made under any Act, to be conferred or imposed on the Commonwealth Statistician’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not sure what other Acts there might be which confer <span class="highlight">powers</span> on the Statistician but I do know that quite apart from the general <span class="highlight">powers</span> which he has under the Census and Statistics Act with regard to the census he has quite widespread <span class="highlight">powers</span> with regard to the compilation of statistics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 19 of the Act provides certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> of entry and inspection and there is a penalty if those provisions are not complied with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assume that all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Statistician in the Census and Statistics Act are to reside in the Bureau and therefore in the Statistician because he is to be the controller of the Bureau under this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the dangerous things in setting up institutions is to give to an institution, which is not purely a judicial body, a pseudo-judicial atmosphere, because there is some kind of feeling of deprivation by those who approach such a body that they are facing, in their belief, a person who is a judge and who has certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> and immunities; that they in fact are in a court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be wrong if those who approached the Grants Commission believed that because a person sitting on the bench was designated as a judge, that person had judicial <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable senators that if the Parliament had wanted this body to have judicial or semi-judicial <span class="highlight">powers</span> it would have written into the legislation that the  chairman  shall be a j udge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As all honourable senators will know, the Australian Film Commission has been given very wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the Act that was passed by the Parliament earlier this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The investment <span class="highlight">powers</span> relating to the Fund are being widened to include investments such as shares and real property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time when the Trade Practices Act was legislated in this chamber the Opposition, of course, drew attention to the width of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> contained in that section and expressed concern as to how they might be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the circumstances I think it is only proper and prudent that whenever a case is publicised of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of that section being used and, on the reports which are evident, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> being abused, there should be as speedy a revelation of the actual circumstances as it is within the Minister’s competence to provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet that Government was sought to be overthrown by insurgency from within, aided by aggression from North Vietnam and a continual supply of arms, munitions and the weapons of war by the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> which supported the North Vietnamese and the Vietcong cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Committees of management are given <span class="highlight">powers</span> which deny the rank and file members their rights if a committee of management decides that it wants to facilitate an amalgamation ballot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you take up a modern volume of the reports of the Queen’s Bench Division, you will find that about half the cases reported have to do with rules of administrative law; I mean with such matters as local rating, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of local boards, the granting of licences for various trades and professions, the Public Health Acts, the Education Acts, and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason for that, as was given over many decades, was that such a system as is embraced within this Bill ran counter to the concept of the rule of law, and the argument went that the rule of law implied the absence of wide discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the Government affecting the personal liberty, the private property rights and the freedom of contract of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But a change has taken place in recent decades, a change which I suggest has been dictated by political considerations and by a realisation by governments that it is essential to protect the rights of individuals, especially in view of the increasing intrusion of the state into other affairs; that the extremely wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> often of necessity put on a discretionary basis, and exercised by Ministers and officials, should be subject to proper checks and balances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hand in hand with these new duties must go new <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The performance of the functions or the exercise of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Council is not affected by a vacancy in the office of a member referred to in paragraph ( 1 ) (a), (b) or (c) or by reason of the number of appointed members falling below 3 for not more than 3 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government believes that these two immediate decisions relating to the report of the Commonwealth Administrative Review Committee will be taken as a tangible demonstration of the significance it attaches to the protection of the rights of individuals at a time when governments exercise extensive <span class="highlight">powers</span> on their behalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We in our Constitution endeavoured to provide protection of individual rights by creating an entrenched judiciary in the Federal field, lt is well known that we adopted to some degree from America the separation of <span class="highlight">powers</span> and that that was much influenced by Montesquieu ‘s mistaken interpretation of the English system at the time the American Constitution was penned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where an enactment, being an Act or an Ordinance of a Territory, authorizes the making of regulations prescribing matters necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to the Act or Ordinance, regulations under the Act or Ordinance may provide, notwithstanding that so to provide would be inconsistent with the Act or Ordinance, that applications may be made to the Tribunal for review of decisions made in the exercise of <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred by the Act or Ordinance, and, where regulations under the Act or Ordinance so provide, provision may also be made by regulations under the Act or Ordinance modifying or excluding the operation of any provision of the Act or Ordinance providing for appeals from or reviews of decisions in respect of which applications may be made to the Tribunal for review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition has an amendment seeking to add 2 new sub-clauses to clause 40, which details the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Tribunalpowers such as the taking of evidence, the adjournment of proceedings, proceedings to deal with a matter in the absence of a party, and the power of the Tribunal to summon persons to appear before it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Senate will well remember that in recent years some Senate committees excited a considerable amount of attention because of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> they were able to exercise in requiring people to appear before them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that when we give <span class="highlight">powers</span> to tribunals- we are giving enormous <span class="highlight">powers</span> to tribunals these days- some of these rights should be allowed to be lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 43 enables the Tribunal, when making its decision, to affirm decisions which are under review, to vary decisions which are under review or to exercise other <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are set out in the clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Dairy Produce Export Control Act 1924-1973 to change the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and membership of the Australian Dairy Produce Board as part of the Government’s programme to provide progressively more effective regulatory and marketing services to Australian primary industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The additional <span class="highlight">powers</span> proposed will strengthen the Corporation’s regulatory responsibilities and provide it with more flexibility in its financial and trading operations to permit this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The existing <span class="highlight">powers</span> are to be assumed by the Corporation with additions in 3 main areas where it is considered that a change would benefit the industry and improve the Corporation’s operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third area relates to the borrowing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Corporation which presently restrict advances under Australian Government guarantee to dairy produce intended for export. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clauses 8 and 10 (23) extend the present borrowing <span class="highlight">powers</span> to permit advances to be used to finance winter stocks by allowing product subject to Corporation advances to be withdrawn for the local market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission saw the Act as requiring it to exercise <span class="highlight">powers</span> of a judicial character and in its First Report made in 1933 said that it regarded its work as ‘judicial in character and method ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Grants Commission to undertake inquiries as they are set out in sections 16 and 1 8, put it in much the same role as a permanently constituted commission of inquiry presided over by a person of judicial status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In seeking support for the inclusion of that provision in the Bill the Opposition emphasised the enormous <span class="highlight">powers</span> that were contained in the Bill which was then before the Senate and recounted the relationship between those <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the total life of the private citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those were <span class="highlight">powers</span> that would alter and affect the life of the private citizen insofar as they were related to the whole aspect of information which the private citizen may be asked to give, which the private citizen may be expected to supply and, if I may say so, which the private citizen may be compelled to provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I should point out again to the Committee and to the Minister that the measure which is before us tonight bestows upon the Government of the day enormous <span class="highlight">powers</span> and an enormous opportunity for moving into the total area of privacy as far as the citizens of this nation are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We did not have a committee with such wide ranging <span class="highlight">powers</span> as the Hope Committee which presented such an effective report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It defines optometry as the means of doing or performing one or more of the following acts, matters or things, that is to say, the examination of the eyes, the measurement of their functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> with the object of determining whether there is any and if so the nature or degree of any abnormality or defect of sight, the correction, remedying and relieving of any abnormality or defect of sight by means of an optical appliance or orthoptic treatment and optical dispensing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that the Prices Justification Tribunal has been and is continuing to be an effective instrument against inflation as far as its existing <span class="highlight">powers</span> will allow it to go; that it has dealt fairly and as expeditiously as possible with the companies within its jurisdiction; that it has retained a degree of flexibility in its approach, which changing economic circumstances require; and that, in particular, it has been giving full emphasis to the need to maintain profitability at a level that will sustain investment and employment which is, of course, the theme of the Government’s submission to the present Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, of course, talks about clarification of the Act and, as was said by a member of the Government Party in another place, the Government wants to obtain 2 new <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the general public thought that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As was pointed out in a previous debate, there are <span class="highlight">powers</span> here that, if they were carried to the extreme, could virtually be a form of censorship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, by this legislation, basically is seeking to remove any legal doubt about whether or not the Australian Broadcasting Control Board has power to carry out its functions and to exercise its <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the existing Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to suggest that the amendments which have been introduced do no more than remedy the defects is to overlook the very wide and unlimited <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the amendment would give to the Australian Broadcasting <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The troubles that we got into as a result of the 25 per cent tariff cut- I am the first to admit that we got into troubles over the 25 per cent tariff cut, although it is irrelevant to this particular question- were due not so much to the mistaken idea of a tariff cut but were due largely to the fact that we do not have complementary <span class="highlight">powers</span> to make a tariff cut achieve the purpose that we set out to achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the reason we could not do anything about that was that we were denied the <span class="highlight">powers</span> over prices that we sought in a referendum against which the Opposition campaigned so fiercely a year or so ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I merely summarise by saying that those <span class="highlight">powers</span> appear to me to be not controvertible in the way in which this Government proposes to act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is to include a constitutional amendment for the interchange of <span class="highlight">powers</span> between the Australian and State parliaments- a much needed constitutional amendment; consideration of the constitutional position of local government; several important references of power to the Australian Parliament, and a number of matters of importance to the Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such <span class="highlight">powers</span> exist already and it is not the intention of the Government to permit the dumping of goods in Australia to the detriment of Australian industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This clause confers wide discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span> on the Minister whereby he may disregard any part of a vessel price for the purpose of determining bounty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span> are likely to be used in this way it will add to the uncertainty already existing in the minds of owners and builders in the whole matter of bounty determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have realised for a long time that there have been certain drawbacks and there still are certain drawbacks within the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that they have had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not see any great difference in this respect, except that there will be a strengthening of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> available to the Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that these trading <span class="highlight">powers</span> will help to strengthen the Australian Dairy Corporation to achieve what it is hoped will be achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other purpose of the Bill, of course, is purely one that concerns the borrowing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also increases the trading <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is known throughout the Commonwealth that there are very stringent <span class="highlight">powers</span>, including the ultimate power of taking away a man’s livelihood, which supreme courts can exercise over barristers and solicitors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this present Government has been slothful because it has not yet given to the Legislative Assembly any executive <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pose the question: What is the value of having a representative assembly which does not have any <span class="highlight">powers</span> to excercise? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation sets up an authority to manage the Marine Park and provides it with very wide <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would have thought that if <span class="highlight">powers</span> are to be given to preserve the Great Barrier Reef, if there is to be a Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, those controlling <span class="highlight">powers</span> should cover the whole of the Great Barrier Reef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I presume it is the intention that at least some <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be exercised in respect of the whole of this region; but it does seem as though it is intended that the legislation will have a more restrictive effect and that only portions of this great region will be controlled and become a marine park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no power in this Parliament to disturb the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Queensland Government in relation to the islands within the region any more than there is to establish parks in a State unless the Government resumes areas of the State or the areas are conferred on it by the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place it is not yet established that this Parliament indeed has the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are necessary to give proper effect to the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although legislation on this subject has been passed through this Parliament it is still a subject of consideration by the High Court of Australia and no decision has yet been made by the High Court which will clarify the nature of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the respective parliaments of the Commonwealth and of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to exercise these <span class="highlight">powers</span> effectively there will arise not only the questions of the control of the reefs themselves and of the subsoil of the sea bed but there will also be questions arising as to jurisdiction over the waters themselves, as to the fisheries within them, as to navigation rights and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is quite clear that the exercise of <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this Bill raises and will raise a vast number of very difficult questions not only of Australian constitutional law but also of international law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is perfectly obvious that it is not a practical proposition for the Commonwealth Government or an authority of that Government to exercise <span class="highlight">powers</span> within an area of this kind without having to co-operate at almost every point with the Government of the State which is adjacent to the area and which controls a large number of islands which are within the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already made some mention of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that can be exercised by the Authority, for example, the establishment of marine parks and of special zones within the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are very wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> of regulation in relation to the whole of the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, <span class="highlight">powers</span> will be exercised also in relation to a great many commercial activities in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill contains very wide <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It contains <span class="highlight">powers</span> which I think will create legal problems as well as problems concerning the preservation of the area, the ecology and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, I ask how will the existing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister for Agriculture  (Senator Wriedt)  and his control over fisheries be phased out? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put to the Senate that the only way in which this matter can be properly resolved is by a royal commission consisting of at least one judge, preferably three, with all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that a royal commission has- with all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents and to provide protection for witnesses who give evidence before it- not one of those hole in the corner so-called judicial inquiries but a full royal commission of at least a judge or judges with all the power that goes with a royal commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the discussion which took place envisage, amongst other areas of co-operation, reference of <span class="highlight">powers</span> from the State to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-9-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did  Mr Justice  Murphy, as Attorney-General, also promise at the Standing Committee’s meeting on 3 July 1 973 to let the States have an outline of the type and scope of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which he felt would be necessary to enable the Commonwealth to legislate in a competent manner removed from any constitutional doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-9-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) On 25 June 1 973 my predecessor received a letter from the then Attorney-General of New South Wales stating that his Cabinet had indicated that it would give favourable consideration to any request for a reference of <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the corporations field subject to arrangements being embodied in any Australian legislation for the preservation of the States’ existing administrative roles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-9-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (7) It became apparent that there would be no point in providing the States with such documents, having regard to (a) a firm indication by the Victorian AttorneyGeneral that Victoria would not refer additional <span class="highlight">powers</span> to enable the Australian Parliament to pass laws relating to companies and (b) a conclusion reached by my predecessor that it would not be appropriate for the States to have responsibility in the administration of the proposed legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-9-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) That the Senate affirms that it possesses the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and privileges of the House of Commons as conferred by Section 49 of the Constitution and has the power to summon persons to answer questions and produce documents, files and papers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750715_senate_29_s64/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Office will prepare simple documents such as simple wills or <span class="highlight">powers</span> of attorney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750715_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-4-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate affirms that it possesses the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and privileges of the House ofCommons as conferred by Section 49 of the Constitution and has the power to summon persons to answer questions and produce documents files and papers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do they disagree with the first paragraph, which states that we affirm that we have the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and privileges of the House of Commons as conferred upon us by section 49 of the Constitution? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Constitution the Senate has the <span class="highlight">powers</span>, immunities and privileges possessed by the House of Commons at the time the Commonwealth was founded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What were those <span class="highlight">powers</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to what was said by an English Judge in 1845 as to what those <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the House of Commons were. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Parliament, if this Senate, abdicates the functions and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the rights which it possesses to get information in the public interest then it shall be doing a fateful disservice to the institution of Parliament itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>neither the doctrine of separation of <span class="highlight">powers</span>, nor the need for confidentiality of high level communications, without more, can sustain an absolute, unqualified presidential privilege of immunity from judicial process under all circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have in this case a motion which first affirms the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate affirms that it possesses the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and privileges of the House of Commons as conferred by Section 49 of the Constitution- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The foregoing rules shall in no way restrict the mode in which the Senate may exercise and uphold its <span class="highlight">powers</span>, privileges and immunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) That the Senate affirms that it possesses the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and privileges of the House of Commons as conferred by Section 49 of the Constitution and has the power to summon persons to answer questions and produce documents files and papers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In relation to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and privileges of the Senate as conferred by section 49 of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is, of course, written in and imbedded into our Constitution, to a fairly strong extent, the notion of the separation of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> as between Executive and legislature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That maxim would be well served by resolute action by the Senate of a kind which will manifest to public officials generally that, in a democracy, the institution of Parliament is still paramount: that Cabinet derives what <span class="highlight">powers</span> it may have from the Parliament, and not Parliament from the Cabinet; and that Parliament’s rights are, in essence, the rights of the citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also proper that the Senate should examine its <span class="highlight">powers</span> to appoint a special prosecutor, as was necessary in order to penetrate the cover-up in the United States last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We remind ourselves that this resolution deals with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and rights of the Senate not because we want to seek them for any personal reasons but because we recognise that we have obligations to maintain the position of the Senate as a protector of the people of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at  Mr Odgers’  book, which is the authority on this matter, we find that at page 566 he says that the House of Commons, amongst other <span class="highlight">powers</span>, had the right to institute inquiries and to require the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a House of Parliament we are entitled to balance that interest and we are justified in saying that we should make this decision and that it is part of our <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other statement which  Mr Fraser  made, that the Government had wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> to determine what would be national interest insurance and that these <span class="highlight">powers</span> would enable the Australian Government Insurance Corporation to compete unfairly with the private insurance companies, also was erroneous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government does not have these <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not at all keen on giving commissions or Ministers untrammelled <span class="highlight">powers</span> in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It had been intended that this Chapter would draw together the many recommendations made throughout the report and would provide further detail of the recommendations, within the Committee’s terms of reference, regarding the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions of the proposed Securities Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The desirability and feasibility of establishing a securities and exchange commission by the Commonwealth either alone or in co-operation with the States and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions necessary for such a commission to enable it to act speedily and efficiently against manipulation of prices, insider trading and such other improper or injurious practices as the Committee finds have occurred or may occur in relation to shares and other securities of public companies, and to recommend generally in regard to the foregoing such legislative and administrative measures by the Commonwealth as will, having regard to the constitutional division of legislative power in Australia, enable the utmost protection of members of the public and the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Constitution itself provides by section 74 that no appeal shall be permitted to the Privy Council from a decision of the High Court upon any question, howsoever arising, as to the limits  inter se  of the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth and those of any State or States or as to the limits  inter se  of the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> of any two or more States, unless the High Court shall certify that the question is one which ought to be determined by the Privy Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister may, by writing under his hand, give directions to the Commission with respect to the exercise of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> or the performance of its functions, either generally or with respect to a particular case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is clear from the statements that have been made and it is obvious that we can expect the use of clause 17 and other <span class="highlight">powers</span> in this Bill to give effect to Labor Party policies in the following areas: Urban and regional development, worker participation, compulsory unionism, compensation and insurance, import policies, environmental control, standards and efficiency in research, industry restructuring and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are even <span class="highlight">powers</span> within this Bill, under clause 9, to declare, by regulation, the policies that are to be adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it is a body which accords with a number of other proposals which this Government makes to centralise and to sweep away <span class="highlight">powers</span> so that the private sector will be thoroughly controlled by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission, which are set out in section 6 of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That it should be regarded as a piece of effrontery to exercise acknowledged legal <span class="highlight">powers</span> is in keeping with the trend that the assertion of any legal right is presumptuous by the owner of that right and a piece of callous inhumanity against whoever infringes the right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the corporation power the Government has further <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The idea that there is any verity in the Corporation’s being subject to those Acts is one of those pieces of fantastic nonsense with which  Senator Wheeldon  is most apt to display his dramatic <span class="highlight">powers</span> in this Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is rather an amusing side to a serious subject because the legal advice given to me is that for constitutional reasons the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Tribunal in this respect are limited to companies and cannot be directed to individual people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Tribunal’s jurisdiction extends only to companies, for constitutional reasons, and its <span class="highlight">powers</span> are limited to this type of business organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Schedule inserted in the Senate set out those statutory <span class="highlight">powers</span> in respect of which it was possible in the time available to provide a right of appeal to the Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the praliamentary recess a number of other Acts were considered with a view to enabling the tribunal to review a greater range of statutory <span class="highlight">powers</span>- of course, these will be added to from time time- having regard largely to the recommendations of the Bland Committee and legislation enacted since the Committee reported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One does not achieve a proper and effective working of our system of government by a consistent confrontation, by a reliance upon assumed <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the Australian Government does not have and by a flat contradiction of the claims by the States that at least they ought to be consulted in these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The third ground of objection which the Opposition has is that it is a misuse of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Statute of Westminster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It represents an endeavour by the Commonwealth, as I see it, to misuse the <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the Statute of Westminster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In each case a Deputy Ombudsman will be appointed and will have all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Ombudsman except that of reporting to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to establish the office of Defence Force Ombudsman and to define his <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Defence Force Ombudsman in connection with his investigation of a matter are similar to those contained in the Ombudsman Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I want to consider what is the nature of the provision and whether the type of <span class="highlight">powers</span> which it seeks to give are the best type of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to promote that regulation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are immense <span class="highlight">powers</span> and I do not think anyone would doubt them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I noted that  Senator Greenwood  earlier in his remarks spoke of the wider <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are given to the Minister under this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that there are wider <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the Minister should be given, but I guess that is a matter of degree rather than of principle because during the past 3 years, despite the fact that the legislation has worked reasonably well, we have learned by experience that it can be improved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other major point to which he referred, and the one on which he closed, was the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which he felt were given to the Treasurer under this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> under that legislation were no different from the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which obtain under this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is not a matter of this legislation being the subject of any marked change in the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are given to the responsible Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The basic <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Secretary, as Permanent Head of the Department, are set out in section 25 1 (2) of the Public Service Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the extent that specific <span class="highlight">powers</span> are given in the Defence Act to the Chief of Defence Force Staff and the Chiefs of Staff, these <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Secretary must be read down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I can remember that early in its life this Government attempted to implement a prices and incomes policy and it sought additional constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the Opposition carried on a great scare campaign and said that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> sought were unnecessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is the duty of the Board, within the limits of its <span class="highlight">powers</span>, to ensure that the monetary and banking policy of the Bank is directed to the greatest advantage of the people of Australia, and that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Bank under the Banking Act 1959 and the regulations under that Act are exercised in such a manner as, in the opinion of the Board, will best contribute to the stability of the currency of Australia, the maintenance of full employment in Australia, and the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I had to wander back to the Public Service Act and find what are the Secretary ‘s <span class="highlight">powers</span> under that Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">powers</span> were given to the Governor-General himself and not to the Governor-General in Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) The Governor-General may delegate to the Chief of Defence Force Staff or to an officer of the Army any of his <span class="highlight">powers</span> under sections 10 and 10b to appoint and promote Officers of the Army. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the United States the position of Secretary of Defense, which is a most political position, has developed very much when compared with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that a Secretary of one of our departments has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What this has done is to give a priority to the Secretary of the Department whose <span class="highlight">powers</span> interweave with the whole of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of command of the Chief of Defence Force Staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister should be cut down by independent authority vested in any official, whether he be Service or civilian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even more significant, the proposed new section 9a restricts the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Secretary of the Department under section 25 (2) of the Public Service Act by specifically providing that the administration of the defence force should be the joint responsibility, under the Minister, of the Secretary and the CDFS. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Far from extending the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Secretary or his officers, the combined result of this sharing of administrative responsibility and the greater direct input into departmental business of Service officers represents a substantial move towards a better balance in the civil and military advice reaching the Minister and the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Section 68 of the Constitution has never been regarded as a bar to Parliament, in pursuance of its power under section 51 (VI) of the Constitution, making laws investing officers and other authorities with practical command over the Defence Force, any part thereof or the members of any part of that Force or regulating the manner in which those <span class="highlight">powers</span> are to be exercised- so long at any rate, as no attempt is made to derogate from the formal supreme command vested in the Governor-General by section 68 of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In reaching this decision the Government has taken into account that the Remuneration Tribunal reviewed salaries and allowances in 1974, that determinations and reports arising from this review were re-presented in the Tribunal’s 1975 review and took effect from 1 March 1 975, and the fact that these determinations and reports were made by the Tribunal itself in accordance with its <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the existing Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>PART III-<span class="highlight">POWERS</span> OF COMMISSION <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is rather a distant time to ask honourable senators to recall some words in a speech of mine in May, but I do take leave to remind honourable senators that when speaking in the debate on the motion for the second reading of this Bill I adumbrated this amendment and referred to it  as invoking the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Inter-State Commission for particular benefit from the point of view of Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What  Senator Wright  proposes conflicts entirely with the arrangements which his own Party agreed upon, because we have dropped out of clause 16 (2) the sort of <span class="highlight">powers</span> which he now wants to be put into the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A declaration in the terms which  Senator Wright  proposes is not only inconsistent with the Conciliation and Arbitration Act but also is quite an extraordinary move towards the sort of <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the Parliament so far has not agreed to give to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the Australian Government uses its constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> to prohibit the export of any mineral sands from Fraser Island, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Special Minister of State whether he has seen a report in the Australian of 24 September of the conference of the Australian Institute of Management in Canberra at which the Prices Justification Tribunal was accused, among other things, of having terrifying <span class="highlight">powers</span> and responsibilities that are hard to define and of being both anti-competition and anti-profit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation establishing the Corporation gave it <span class="highlight">powers</span> to borrow under Government guarantee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I should remind honourable senators that the Bill originally contained a clause, clause 13, which would have enable particular <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions already vested in other bodies under other laws to be transferred to the Inter-State Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would attempt to vest <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions conferred by other laws in the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paragraph (c) of  Senator Wright’s  amendment is an attempt to write into the Bill <span class="highlight">powers</span> that go far beyond those contained in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Constitution Alteration (Inter-change of <span class="highlight">Powers</span>) Bill 1974 Constitution Alteration (Local Government Bodies) Bill 1974 <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator knows perfectly well that the Senate has co-equal <span class="highlight">powers</span> with the House of Representatives, except in certain categories of money Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He made no secret of his interpretation of the Senate’s <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no tradition, as has been suggested, that the Senate will not use its constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> whenever it considers it necessary or desirable to do so in the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no limitations on the Senate in the use of its constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> except the limits self-imposed by discretion and reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Murphy’s  attitude to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate and the traditions of the Labor Party was clear and consistent, unlike that of the Prime Minister who twists and turns at every opportunity, who says one thing when it suits him and the reverse when it equally suits him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate is entitled and expected to exercise resolutely but with discretion its <span class="highlight">powers</span> to refuse its concurrence - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am used to the Labor Party using dictatorial <span class="highlight">powers</span> within its own structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no limitations on the Senate in the use of its constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What most people forget and what the Opposition refuses to accept is that the 3 parts of this trinity do not have equal <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am inclined to believe that the decision in the Humes Pipes case or the  Rocla Pipes  case which gave the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">powers</span> over corporations was a complete reversal of the decision in the previous  Huddart v. Moorehead  case because the court was applying itself to an interpretation of the changing social functions of our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suppose for example that the States complain that the Commonwealth is using its legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> in a manner which can be accommodated within the literal words of the Constitution but has the intention and effect of substantially diminishing the legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These include: whether it was originally intended that the Commonwealth should be able by unilateral action to bring about such a change otherwise than by formal amendment of the Constitution; if not, whether there is any such ground for departing from the original intention as factual changes in the relative responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the States, or in the place of Australia in the international community, or in economic and social developments since federation; and whether as a general principle legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> can be used to attain ends unrelated to the purpose of the power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no limitations on the Senate in the use of its constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>, except the limitations imposed by discretion and reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only restrictions on the exercise by the Senate of its financial <span class="highlight">powers</span> are the restraint which it traditionally exercises and the electoral sanction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Senate which used its <span class="highlight">powers</span> capriciously could suffer only one fate- punishment at the ballot box. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 49 of the Constitution gives to this Senate the <span class="highlight">powers</span>, privileges and immunities not of the House of Lords but of the House of Commons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, in 1952 in the State of Victoria the upper House, which at that time was partly elected on a restricted franchise but which was controlled by the Australian Labor Party, used its <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the Legislative Council to take to the people a government of a different colour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission operates without respect to State boundaries or <span class="highlight">powers</span> of States and the Commonwealth and therefore would have power to organise its work so as not to be dependent upon a decision of either a State government or the Federal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have fully canvassed the sorts of <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the Inter-State Commission proposed by the Government should have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators now know, looking at the paper that we put down last week, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission have been greatly reduced at the request of the Opposition, as far as we are aware, in a responsible way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the Government did not want to give way on some of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the Commission would have had under the legislation, which had been proposed by the Government and which had been discussed for many years, it decided to do so on the plea of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  that the most advantageous thing to industry and to the nation would be to have the Inter-State Commission set up as quickly as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is unreal for  Senator Wright  to expect the Parliament to give him the <span class="highlight">powers</span> he requests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We certainly could not agree to the industrial <span class="highlight">powers</span> for which he is asking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the strengthening of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission could be considered at a later stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill extends the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Tasman Bridge Restoration Commission which was established by the Tasman Bridge Restoration Act 1975 to include the additional function of organising and constructing a fifth lane on the Hobart Bridge during the course of the restoration work which has been occasioned by the damage done by the collision of the S.S.  Lake Illawarra  with the Bridge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this Bill, the Director-General of Health and his three faceless men in the pricing bureau would have huge <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I may say this without getting into the substance of the debate, the message does call into question whether or not the Senate has the <span class="highlight">powers</span> within the Constitution to do as it did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will operate both as principal and agent with full <span class="highlight">powers</span> of buying and selling goods in either export or import markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the Australian Government uses its constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> to prohibit the export of any mineral sands from Fraser Island, and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>276 is a lawful and proper exercise within the terms of the Constitution of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate were expressly conferred on the Senate as part of the Federal Compact which created the Commonwealth of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That there is no convention and never has been any convention that the Senate shall not exercise its constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no doubt about the Senate’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate will not retreat before this onslaught on the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Parliament because the Senate is fighting for democracy and for the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is amazing to me that the great advocates of parliamentary democracy over the years, the people who challenged all the new revolutionary movements in other parts of the world and talked about the Red thrust from South East Asia, from Saigon, about the danger to parliamentary democracy and about the great <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the trade unions, should now seek to use a power which is badly based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who as lawyers look to constitutional matters should go back to the Constitutional debates and they will understand that the constitutional fathers deliberately pondered upon upper houses overseas and their limited <span class="highlight">powers</span> and constructed an upper House here with <span class="highlight">powers</span> specifically given to it, including this power which is now being used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The compact of Federation in the formation of this great nation was that there would be an Australian Senate, and I believe that, without contest, the Australian Senate now has the <span class="highlight">powers</span> to deal with all Bills and to deal especially with money Bills in the way in which it is dealing with them at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He seems again to be overlooking that it is the Australian people who will alter the Australian Constitution and not an action from the Prime Minister who decides that he will change the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and curb the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Senate as they exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there is no real parallel between the House of Lords and its <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the Australian Senate in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there are many views, both from within the Labor Party and from outside the political scene altogether, which suggest that it most certainly does have the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that it claims- the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are rightly the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no tradition, as has been suggested, that the Senate will not use its constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>, whenever it considers it necessary or desirable to do so, in the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no limitations on the Senate in the use of its constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> except the limits selfimposed by discretion and reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only restrictions on the exercise by the Senate of financial <span class="highlight">powers</span> are the restraint which it traditionally exercises, and the electoral sanction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the performance of the Government that is causing instability in this country and it is the performance of the Government of which the Senate Opposition must take heed today and on which it must act in a responsible manner within the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> of review that so rightly and properly rest with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope now that it will not be a tragic week for Parliament and for the Senate because the action which has been taken has raised many questions and thoughts about the very basis of this House and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which it now possesses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate has <span class="highlight">powers</span> to provide that balance if and when it decides to exercise them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Constitution was drafted to give the Senate equal <span class="highlight">powers</span>, with one small exception, to those of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the great National Australasian Convention Debates of the 1 890s when the Constitution was so laboriously but splendidly drafted and agreed upon, great attention was given to the question of the Senate’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to money Bills and the possibilities and the consequences of deadlocks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They indicate the views which were accepted as the very basis upon which the Constitution was prepared and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> given to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would that not be an absurd position, when we have <span class="highlight">powers</span> given to us by way of suggestion? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having such <span class="highlight">powers</span>, it becomes our duty to exercise them whenever we find it necessary to do so; otherwise we are false to our trust and false to our duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam  has always hated the Senate and he has made it clear that he would like either to abolish the Senate or to curtail its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is part of a deliberate campaign by the Prime Minister to mislead the Australian public and lead the people into a situation in which the Prime Minister could put before them a referendum to curtail the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this chamber so that he can rule absolutely without challenge and without anyone being able to prevent him from being able to carry out the schemes which have already cost Australia so dearly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate, with its full role in relation to money matters, was given those <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be able to protect the States as one of its principal functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The threatened curtailment of the Senate <span class="highlight">powers</span> is a direct attack upon the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Powers</span> of the Senate <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we desire to know what are the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate over money bills, we find them expressly set out in the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now these provisions, which are the material ones, establish quite plainly that, while the Senate may not itself amend what we  call  ‘money bills’, it can pass them, or reject them, because these are the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the House of Representatives in respect of the same measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting that the Opposition should hang its case on the statement issued by a man who retired from politics 10 years ago and whose linkage goes directly back to the last century when the same man is on record at the height of his intellectual <span class="highlight">powers</span> in 1932 and under somewhat more objective circumstances as stating: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now these provisions, which are the material ones, establish quite plainly that, while the Senate may not itself amend what we call ‘Money Bills’, it can pass them, or reject them, because these are the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the House of Representatives in respect of the same measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will, concede the legal aspect, as contained in paragraph (a) of the amendment- that the action is lawful and a proper exercise within the terms of the Constitution of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate- but I would also like to say that there is an implied obligation within that that there should be a just consideration if it is desired that the matter be brought before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Section 53 is, however, a statement of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of each House in respect of all proposed laws; it is the capacity of each House to deal in particular ways with individual Bills with which the section is concerned, not the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of either House to force a dissolution of the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So attached were the founders of the American Constitution to the principal of the ‘separation of <span class="highlight">powers</span>’ between legislature and executive that section 6 of that Constitution expressly provides that ‘no person holding any office under the United States shall be a member of either House during his continuance in Office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An illustrious senator in the Opposition ranks, none other than  Senator Wright,  on one memorable occasion, as spokesman for the then Foreign Minister, said that any attempt to upset, dismantle or fragment Yugoslavia would affect the power structure or the power balance between the NATO and the Warsaw <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These provisions within the Constitution plainly establish, and it needs to be repeated again and again that while the Senate of itself may not amend what we understand as money Bills it can pass them, reject them or defer them and it has this right because it is equal in <span class="highlight">powers</span> with the House of Representatives in respect of such measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>J hope that Government senators will not join in the witch hunt against the Senate that has been indulged in by the Prime Minister and that they will not try to use the exercising of the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this chamber as a smokescreen to divert the debate from the real questions of politics that are affecting Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to say further that if what I am saying is untrue, as  Senator Laucke  has said, I must have very great <span class="highlight">powers</span> as a clairvoyant because many of the things that I divulged in the Senate on the night of 30 September have now come true. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When a government, as in this case, exceeds its <span class="highlight">powers</span> and its authority then these <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate are and were meant by the constitutional fathers to be a safeguard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is because the Prime Minister finds that the Senate seeks, through the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> that it possesses, to refer the performance of this Government to its masters, the people, that his reaction now is quite different to his reaction only 18 months ago, quite different to the action that he advocated in this Parliament for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The main basis upon which  Senator Scott  mounted his attack on the Government on the one hand and attempted to justify the Opposition’s unprecedented action in blocking the Government’s Budget on the other hand rested on what he called ‘the exercise of the responsible <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate by the Opposition’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we discuss this question, the events of 1911 and their effect on the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the House of Lords tend to colour our thinking, and it is something that we should be wary of because we should remember two things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second thing that we should remember is that, even if the framers of our Constitution had intended to limit the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate to reject Supply to be co-extensive with the <span class="highlight">powers</span>  enjoyed by the House of Lords, they would have been thinking of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> enjoyed by the House of Lords in 190 1 and not thinking of the limited <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the Lords were left with after the events of 1 9 10 and 1911 and the passage of the Parliament Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was a committee of this Senate which in 1954 insisted upon that division, and the Bills are divided into two solely because we have different <span class="highlight">powers</span> of amendment in respect of one from the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Their then leader in this place, now  Mr Justice  Murphy, supported the unlimited <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate to defeat money Bills and referred to 168 occasions I think it was since 1952 when the Opposition had attempted to defeat money Bills and to 4 occasions when the Opposition had succeeded in defeating money Bills including Appropriation Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, the Indian Ocean region has always been an area of some great power interest and attraction but until the 1950s and early 1960s it was essentially a colonial interest of colonial <span class="highlight">powers</span> and to this extent any influence was generally confined to related interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the march towards independence and the consequential opportunities of involvement of the great <span class="highlight">powers</span>, there has been an extension of interest and participation especially by Russia, the P.R.C., the United States and Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is difficult to foresee a significant slackening of interest by any one of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> with the result that no matter what the opinions of the countries within the region, they will be unable to prevent the Indian Ocean developing into an area of great power influence and involvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is perhaps still some doubt, and of course there are differing views in the community as to what the precise <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was suggesting that perhaps in about six or nine months time issues such as the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Governor-General, who at the moment seems to have the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of an absolute monarchy, and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate, which at the moment is the most powerful House of Parliament in the world, and the problems created by these <span class="highlight">powers</span>, which have been confirmed by the actions of the Governor-General in November and the elections since, can be discussed perhaps at a constitutional convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said, we seem now to have a Governor-General who has the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of an absolute monarch. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But what started out as an exercise in the rights of the Senate became very rapidly a confrontation between  Mr Whitlam  and the Senate as to whether our <span class="highlight">powers</span> would persist or be destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The election not only provided an endorsement for my Leader, the new Prime Minister,  Mr Malcolm  Fraser, my colleagues who formed the caretaker ministry and who now form the Cabinet and Government of this country, and the policies of the coalition parties, but also asserted once again that the Senate has a role, rights and a place in our bicameral system, that the legitimacy of our Constitution overrides the wishes of any Prime Minister and that the Governor-General has and can use the reserve <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are given to him in the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Whitlam was sure that the Senate’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> would be destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to quote one further small section relating to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without the assertion of those <span class="highlight">powers</span>, the Senate could not effectively fulfil its role as the safety valve of the Australian Federal system and of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fortunately, the Senate has always been rich in institutional members, in whose hands the <span class="highlight">powers</span>, privileges and immunities of the Senate have been, and are, in safe-keeping. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those of us who are parliamentarians must balance our duties to our colleagues in government and to our Prime Minister whom we support with our duties to the Parliament to see that its <span class="highlight">powers</span> are not diminished now or at any time while we remain senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I look to the thirtieth Parliament and to its Senate to carry on this function; to ensure that when we finish here the chamber will still have all its <span class="highlight">powers</span> of review over legislation, all its <span class="highlight">powers</span> to hold back hasty legislation, all its <span class="highlight">powers</span> over the supply of money and all its rights to an independent committee system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that section 53 of the Constitution should be carefully examined and that if there are <span class="highlight">powers</span> permitting the refusal or passing of Supply those <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be curtailed and clearly defined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Labor initiatives between 1972 and 1975, which had resulted in a relationship of trust and confidence between Australia and other littoral states of the Indian Ocean, have been replaced by a policy which seeks to ignore, indeed more accurately to reverse, the passage of time in order to return to the futile era of confrontation between the major <span class="highlight">powers</span>- the United States and the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In place of Labor’s reasoned approach to the question, which sought strenuously to encourage mutual restraint in military commitment to the region by the United States and the Soviet Union, one now discovers that the present Government has adopted the curious position of both encouraging the United States to increase its arms strength in the region while at the same time asking that the super <span class="highlight">powers</span> display mutual restraint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last year  Senator Kilgariff,  then  deputy  leader of the majority party in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, and his leader met with senior officers of the Northern Territory Branch of the Australian Labor Party at their request and assisted in the drafting of a letter to the then Minister seeking transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any diminution of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the trade practices legislation which would allow the law of the jungle to apply and enable billion dollar traders in this community to squeeze small producers as far as they like, would be a blow to the general economic sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In conclusion, I want to mention something about the return of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the States and the talk of a new financial deal for the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The return to the States of taxing <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the upgrading of local government, which I support in the context of our economic capacity, mean higher taxation for every Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been involved previously with Premiers of other States in the most comprehensive compilation of a new approach to a Liberal government in Canberra to return taxing <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>During the period when the Senate first deferred consideration of the Appropriation Bills  Mr Ellicott  issued a Press statement on 19 October 1975 entitled  The GovernorGeneral’s <span class="highlight">Powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major burden of that statement was to give quite strongly an opinion that the Governor-General was obliged to exercise certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> within the meaning of the circumstances with which we were faced at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a matter on which my own mind is quite clear and I am acting in accordance with my own clear view of the principles laid down by the Constitution and of the nature, <span class="highlight">powers</span> and responsibility of my office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr R. J. Ellicott, Q.C., M.P., at the Attorney-General’s request made available to him a copy of a Press statement relating to the Governor-General’s <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Enderby  struck out  Mr Byers’  signature and pointed out to the Governor-General that while this was the personal opinion of the SolicitorGeneral, it was not a joint opinion and that he himself expressed strong views in terms of, first, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate and, secondly, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Governor-General in the circumstances that then existed which were diametrically opposed- I repeat, diametrically opposed- to the action that the GovernorGeneral in fact took. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be absurd to suppose that the draftsmen of the Constitution conferred these <span class="highlight">powers</span> on the Senate with a mental reservation that they should never be exercised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate was very quick to recognise its <span class="highlight">powers</span> and, when the Executive Government first sought funds in 1901, the Senate deferred the passing of Supply until the Government acknowledged that the provision of Supply was a joint grant of the two Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">powers</span> are checks and balances against any concentration of unbridled power in the Executive Government, or against any misuse of power or mismanagement by a Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the proper constitutional course of a government whose appropriation of Supply Bill is rejected or deferred is then either to advise a general election or to resign, let us consider the propriety of the exercise by the GovernorGeneral of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that he exercised on 1 1 November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is perfectly clear from our classic commentary on the constitution by Quick and Garran (see for example pages 406 and 685), published in 1901, that those <span class="highlight">powers</span> were from the outset intended to be exercised only on the advice of his ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>According to Hobbes’  Leviathan  a Commonwealth arises as a result of a group of equal and free individuals abdicating some of their rights, <span class="highlight">powers</span> and freedoms in favour of a single body, in return for certain safeguards which singly they could not provide for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Dr Tonkin, Leader of the Opposition in South Australia and a member of the Liberal Party, at the Liberal Party Council meeting in Canberra last October sought a guarantee from that body that the less populous States would not be disadvantaged by the decision to restore income tax <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While it is true that the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  has made various statements about a cheaper bureaucracy, what in fact is happening today is that the Federal Government is investing in the Commonwealth Employment Service officers vast new <span class="highlight">powers</span>, which they should not have, to decide how to judge the eligibility of a person to receive unemployment benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One particularly objectionable feature of a proposition to restore significant income taxing <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the States which has not yet been brought out in any of the debates on this proposition is the scandalously undemocratic nature of every State Parliament in Australia with the exception of that of Tasmania- even there, of course, the Upper House is scandalously undemocratic- and that of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps the existing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth under section 5 1 (iii) which deals with the power with respect to bounties on the production and export of goods- but such bounties must be uniform throughout Australia- and under section 99 by which preference cannot be given to one State or any part of a State, need to be altered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Pharmacy Guild has subsequently issued a High Court writ to test the extent of the Government’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> to determine chemists’ rates of remuneration for dispensing pharmaceutical benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What proportion, if any, of the special fund does the Government under the <span class="highlight">powers</span> assigned to it in paragraphs 7 and 8, intend to allocate to discharging Australia’s obligation towards the inhabitants of the Island when the time comes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it usual practice for State Governments to negotiate aid and assistance agreements with foreign <span class="highlight">powers</span> without reference to the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-70">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Even I admit that my <span class="highlight">powers</span> of persuasion are not of that order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the present Inquiry into the Australian Broadcasting System has been directed to give particular attention to the structure, <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions of the ABC, as well as other relevant bodies, and this Inquiry will consider alternative methods of funding the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will examine the matter to see what influence or <span class="highlight">powers</span> the Federal Government has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, there are audits of quasi-departmental, or intergovernmental activities in pursuance of a request by a Minister- it is undesirable as a matter of principle for the Auditor-General to accept such requests without a proper expression in the Audit Act of his standing and <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will note that no change is proposed in this Bill to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and responsibilities of the Auditor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government does not wish to make any such changes to the AuditorGeneral’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> at this stage but will give further consideration to whether they should be extended, and if so, just how they should be extended, at the appropriate time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Authority has continued in existence since that time, although, as indicated below, its <span class="highlight">powers</span> have undergone considerable change since 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until 1970, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions of the Authority were vested in a Chairman, and 2 other members, one of whom was to be experienced in industrial affairs by reason of having been an employer in an industry or having been otherwise associated with management in industry; and the other experienced in industrial affairs by reason of having been associated with trade union affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority put forward detailed submissions as to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and operation of such a body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst there is some last minute recognition by the Liberal and Country Party Government of poverty and it has taken some steps in the right direction in this economic package, the fact is that this action will not bring about that essential stimulus which is necessary in the economy because there are operating factors which are beyond the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of” government, and certainly beyond the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the conditions that should be applied if the States are to gain income taxing <span class="highlight">powers</span> is that they reduce those day labour forces and introduce far more contract work into their very large physical operations which involve the spending of their capital funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the administration of the project grants element, the Board will also be required to pay due regard to total funds allocated to it for grant purposes in the Budget context, as well as constraints imposed on its <span class="highlight">powers</span> to enter into financial commitments in respect of future grant years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not intended that these <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be used extensively, or that they should be used in relation to contribution rates in such a way as to discourage competition between organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are significant <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the Bill therefore provides, in new part VII A, for a decision taken by the Minister in relation to the matters I have just outlined to be subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which will be operating at the time these provisions commence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a tragedy, nevertheless, that great <span class="highlight">powers</span> have sought to use problems arising from such situations not to achieve actively a just solution but to achieve the dominance of one ideology over another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A second aspect of the world situation giving rise to concern is the state of relations between the super <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Despite the hopes placed in  detente,  it has not stabilised relations between the great <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is not a plea for any power to be a policeman for the world, nor to do what small <span class="highlight">powers</span> should do for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a world whose relations also depend however, on the actions of other major <span class="highlight">powers</span>- China, Japan and the European <span class="highlight">powers</span>- and within particular regions also on the distribution of power between middle and small states. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The international diplomacy of the major <span class="highlight">powers</span>- with which Australia has to deal- has to be understood principally as an effort by these <span class="highlight">powers</span> to create a balance in the world favourable to their interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in the pursuit of a more favourable balance that their policies impinge on middle <span class="highlight">powers</span>, such as Australia, and on areas of immediate importance to Australia, such as South East Asia, the South Pacific area, and the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why does the Soviet Union desire military power far greater than any needed to secure its frontiers or the expanded frontiers embraced by the Warsaw <span class="highlight">powers</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister for Primary Industry in relation to the Australian Meat Board are specified in the Meat Industry Act 1964-1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there any way that the Minister for Post and Telecommunications or the Government can reverse this decision; or is this an example of a statutory commission usings its <span class="highlight">powers</span> to discriminate against people- in this case people in isolated areas- without the knowledge of Parliament whence it obtains its funds? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that that gives the Minister quite incredible <span class="highlight">powers</span> and I fear would give him a capacity to dictate to the funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While this report is relatively short, it concerns a matter of great importance to the Senate, that is, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> our appropriation Bills conferred on the Senate by the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As to the other part of the honourable senator’s question in respect of nuclear waste facilities, I point out to the Senate that in view of Australia’s constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> and responsibilities under the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, any question relating to the establishment of nuclear waste facilities in Australia is a matter for the Commonwealth Government alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The result of that was the Pharmacy Guild’s taking out of a High Court writ against the Commonwealth to test the Government’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> to determine the chemists’ rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst I welcome the action taken in 1 974 to establish a fully elected Legislative Assembly, there was little point in bringing that about without the transfer to the Assembly of real <span class="highlight">powers</span> and responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As soon as the Final Act was signed and published, the Soviet <span class="highlight">powers</span> ignored fully its humanitarian articles and even introduced a definite ‘demonstration of strong line’ in an endeavour to rely, to some extent, on their own interpretation of the principle of non-intervention in the ‘internal affairs ‘ which are stressed in the Final Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commission has it general administrative role under this proposed new section and it has certain other roles, as I have said, to give clearances under particular sections of the Act, but the question of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission and the proper interpretation and ambit of the Act are essentially matters for decision by a court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-As I understand the Australian Law Reform Commission’s report on police <span class="highlight">powers</span>, it was unanimous in some respects, but there was dissent, I think by  Mr Justice  Brennan, as he now is, from some aspects of the Commission’s findings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>First, in relation to the Continental Shelf (Living Natural Resources) Act, the Bill places the statutory <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred by the Act in the hands of the Minister for Primary Industry and the Secretary to his Department, rather than in that Minister and the Minister having responsibility for external Territories, as in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I must say that since this Government has come to power in the last few months some recognition has been given to the report of the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory which spells out the transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It might be claimed that due to the upsets which occurred in the Second World War these people may have been involved with the Axis <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his early youth, because of the very strong feeling that existed in mainland China about the intervention in the internal affairs of that country by many of the Western <span class="highlight">powers</span> he became an official of the Kuomintang, which was the revolutionary movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since I have been in the Parliament in most Bills provision is made for either the total delegation of <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister or directorate, or partial delegation of power to some officer of the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I am of the opinion that if a Minister wants to delegate authority in relation to some duties which he or she has not time to undertakethis can be understood- it should be delegated to some class of officer or it should be a partial delegation or a delegation of only some <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On page 2233 of  Hansard  I outlined objections I had to section 73 ba, which gave the Minister power to impose a fine of $2,000 on funds for certain breaches, and also to sections 73ba (1) (g) and 73BA (1) (k), which gave the Minister what I believed to be incredible <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Section 49 of the Constitution says “that the <span class="highlight">powers</span>, privileges and immunities of the Senate are those of the House of Commons.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Constitution is a statute and it defines the Senate ‘s <span class="highlight">powers</span>. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no such practice but Constitution has been interpreted to mean that by never using its ‘theoretical’ <span class="highlight">powers</span> the Senate in practice had always accepted the paramountcy of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is apparent from a reading of the Constitution that some <span class="highlight">powers</span> are given to: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have always taken the view that the least messy way to handle family law legislation is for the Commonwealth to ask the States to refer <span class="highlight">powers</span> in matters associated with divorce such as the custody, maintenance and ancillary matters of those kinds to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that the question of referral of <span class="highlight">powers</span> is not likely to succeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is just because the Governor-General used his constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>- those <span class="highlight">powers</span> most people thought belonged to the days of yesteryear- to serve the interests of the Liberals rather than Labor that the men of good-will, men who may have been bothered by all those errors human frailty and folly had caused Whitlam and Co. to fall prey to, were filled with a righteous indignation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Constitution of India was drafted, it was perhaps never envisaged that emergency would become a constant feature of the national life and the safeguard against the abuse of emergency <span class="highlight">powers</span> would be nullified by a systematic erosion of checks and balances provided in the Constitution such as a free press, judicial review and fundamental rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is the possibility, of course, that such special levies could be used more and more in future to the possible detriment of the States’ surcharge <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those matters lead me to believe that the States face the prospect, after 1980, of having to rely heavily on their surcharging <span class="highlight">powers</span> or of using existing taxing measures to make good any shortfall if the Commonwealth Government places relatively less emphasis on income tax as a revenue raising measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As it is unlikely that the Commonwealth Government will permit the States to enter the income tax field in other than a marginal way, for fear of weakening its <span class="highlight">powers</span> of economic management, the burden could well fall back on the States’ traditional taxation fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So keeping that in mind and bearing in mind the tendency of the Labor Party to centralisation, one of the fascinating things of recent days has been the expression, for example, of one State Labor front bencher,  Mr Mulock,  who is on record as in fact condemning those very things that the Federal Labor Party advocates- centralism and domination from the centre- and condemning those who, like the Federal Labor Party, argue that we are wrong in our concept of federalism that there should be a proper sharing of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> among Commonwealth, State and local governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761014_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I propose to say something in the course of my speech today about the activities of the Commonwealth Government and of the Attorney-General  (Mr Ellicott),  whom I represent, which will indicate, and which I think will satisfy the Senate, that in fact very great attention has been given by this Government to the civil liberties and to the expansion of the civil liberties of Australians, insofar as it is within our <span class="highlight">powers</span> to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I am really getting at- one has to digress a little- is that in that instance we were looking at the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Government to emulate Canada when it declared a river a disaster area and Ottawa funded the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take it that in the general compass of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the Commission has there naturally will be some consideration of the economics, but the Commission will not be expected to be an expert body in respect to the financing of conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will go on to point out that there was a real fear that the current Administration would gradually take away the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It reflects the attitude of this Government in its endeavours to tighten its control and, as a consequence, lessening the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition is going to oppose fundamentally the membership of the Australian Heritage Commission being reduced from 1 9 to 7 members, even though the National Trust has said that it supports this and even though we heard  Senator Missen,  I think it was, quote the  Chairman  of the Commission, David Yencken, as saying that this amending legislation does not in any way take away the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that if the commissioners which it is proposed to appoint to the Heritage Commission were given <span class="highlight">powers</span> similar to those of the Schools Commission they would achieve more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If in fact there was a time limit on the legislation or if the Bill was designed to handle this specific problem, then perhaps the Bill as it stands would be warranted, and even that clause might be warranted; but the Bill will give <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Attorney-General on other matters which may arise in the future and of which we have no knowledge at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I should like to point out that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the AttorneyGeneral under this Bill can be exercised only where there is a situation in which jurisdiction of a foreign tribunal is purported to be exercised outside the ambit of international law or comity of nations or where the Australian national interest is at stake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does not the Minister agree that such discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span> cannot apply to a section of the community collectively? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was this very Government that opposed the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that we sought over prices and incomes in 1973, <span class="highlight">powers</span> which this Parliament should have and which I would suggest this Government today would give its right arm to have because it realises now the difficulty of containing these factors without those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A story in the  Daily Mirror of  today’s date, under the heading ‘Fraser seeks new <span class="highlight">powers</span>’, reads: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will introduce legislation to give it payfixing <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It would be ludicrous to suggest that this Government is not wanting those very <span class="highlight">powers</span> itself now and well may it want them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were the ones who tried to impress on the Federal Government, on our opponents in 1973, and on the Australian people the need to have those <span class="highlight">powers</span> at the federal level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It also confers certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> of a general nature to facilitate the operation of other Acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think anyone would question the calibre of the selected commissioners, but one of the difficulties is that the Australian Heritage Commission has somewhat limited <span class="highlight">powers</span> compared with the original ideas of the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>By way of preface I refer to the very sensitive role that Australia’s Ambassador in Belgrade has to perform in a country which is beset by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation <span class="highlight">powers</span> on the one side and the Warsaw <span class="highlight">powers</span> on the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee is concerned that the legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> and procedures at present in force cannot protect historic shipwrecks in Australia from indiscriminate looting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other matter that I wish to raise- I do not know what the solution to the matter might berelates to clause 23 (2) which gives very wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> of inspection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there is an obligation on the inspector by oath or affirmation to satisfy a justice of the peace that he ought to have these <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nonetheless, having said that, there is always a feeling- a suspicion- on the part of people that, once a justice of the peace issues a search warrant of that type, a person occupying a position of authority, by the wearing of a uniform, might exceed to the utmost the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the search warrant rather than use the minimum <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the search warrant when that might be sufficient for the purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) The Minister may, either generally or as otherwise provided by the instrument of delegation, by writing signed by him, delegate to a person any of his <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this Act, other than his power of delegation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am practical and reasonable enough to realise that a Minister does not delegate his <span class="highlight">powers</span> unwisely or unnecessarily, but there is provision in this Bill for the widest possible power of delegation by a Minister, although there is no provision for a Minister, whoever he may be, to make an annual report to the Parliament on the provisions of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to carry out his ministerial functions he has to be provided by the Parliament with general and very wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> of delegation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nonetheless, because, and especially because, he is being provided by this Parliament with very wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> of delegation,  ipso facto  there should be a responsibility on the Minister representing the Executive Government to make a report to this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I do not try to tie down the Minister’s general power of delegation, I implore the Minister to consider giving an undertaking, if he is not prepared to amend the Bill, that it is intended that there should be presented to the Parliament an annual report on the administration of the Historic Shipwrecks Bill, particularly as it affects the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of delegation in regard to the responsibility of the receiver of shipwrecks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate what  Senator McClelland  has said but I am advised that one of the reasons that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of delegation tend to be wider than might be thought fit is that, as the honourable senator will recall, under Part III of the Bill, particularly in clause 19, there is a capacity for the GovernorGeneral to make arrangements with the Governors of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is one of the major reasons for giving such wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> of delegation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think there will be any resistance from our colleagues in the 6 States to the suggestion that where arrangements are entered into they should advise the Commonwealth Government annually on how they have exercised the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that have been delegated to them under this Bill dealing with the administration of historic shipwrecks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Strange as it may appear to some of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that be, people do have to travel after 10 o’clock at night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite frankly, I remain totally convinced that one answer to the problem facing the Australian beef industry today is to establish a statutory body- the Meat Board could perform this functionto utilise the present <span class="highlight">powers</span> to sell on the overseas markets to the exclusion of private enterprise so that any private meat marketing firm overseas which wants to import into its country Australian beef, or Australian meat for that matter, will have to do so through the authority and pay the going rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that that statement indicates that at least some sections of the meat industry in Australia realise that what I have just said in relation to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Meat Board represents one way in which the industry can go forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs reintroduced the Bill with 42 amendments there were improvements in 2 areas- the reduction in the rights of the Northern Territory to make ordinances interfering with the rights of Aboriginals over their land, and some slight increase in the negotiating <span class="highlight">powers</span> of Aboriginal persons with the mining companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-81-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate that clause 73. of the Bill does impose some limitation on the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in these matters, but only to the extent that the Northern Territory ordinances are capable of operating concurrently with the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-81-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the land councils which were set out in the 1975 Bill have been restored with the exception of their right to be involved in needs claims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is not contemplating any changes in its procedures or <span class="highlight">powers</span> other than those that, as I said earlier, were passed this week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">powers</span> are not limited to cases where there is the requirement of notice by a company before it increases its prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My concern in particular with the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill 1976 is that under clause 73 certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> are to be given to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">powers</span> relate to the protection of sacred sites, the entry of persons to Aboriginal land, the conservation of wildlife and the access to territorial seas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned with the clause because, as honourable senators will know,  Mr Justice  Woodward in his report recommended that these <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be held by the Federal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an exercise of the Commonwealth’s constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> and its responsibility to make special laws for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people where a need is seen for that to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that we have stated more clearly the functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the land councils so that the councils will express the wishes of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that he is anxious to get State-like <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the Northern Territory and to have it declared a State without its having to accept financial responsibility for itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an exercising of the Commonwealth’s constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> and responsibility to make special laws for the Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders where a need is seen for that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Clause 23, dealing with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the land councils, deals with traditional Aboriginal land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are a lot of higher <span class="highlight">powers</span> other than the Senate listening to the outrageous comments made by the Government today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a lot of confusion about the Northern Territory, and as the Government is handing over most of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the Bill to ordinances which will be drafted under Northern Territory laws it will have to take into consideration the fact that the Opposition is reluctant to see it cast away land in towns which may be properly claimed by Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seek some clarification of clause 5 sub-clause (1) (b), which states: to exercise its <span class="highlight">powers</span> as owner of land referred to in paragraph (a) for the benefit of the Aboriginal groups concerned; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Sub-clause 14 (4) limits the Commonwealth’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the Atomic Energy Act to the sections onmining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-7">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new clause that has been proposed by the Opposition is one on which I would comment that, in line with the decision that some <span class="highlight">powers</span> be given to the Northern Territory, the Government has considered it appropriate that rights of entry onto pastoral properties should remain a matter for Northern Territory law- the Crown Lands Ordinance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In line with the decision that some <span class="highlight">powers</span> be given to the Northern Territory, it was considered appropriate that rights of entry on to pastoral properties should remain a matter for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is also to be a more direct relationship between redeployment and retirement <span class="highlight">powers</span> and their clear purpose, namely, the efficient and economical function of the Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we must wait and judge in the next year or two how it operates the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which it has been given under this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, we have the committee as an additional protection to ensure that there is a bona fide exercise by the Northern Territory legislature of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> given under this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the Government has so carelessly thrown away to somebody else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our present Liberal-National Country Party Government is now allowing the Assembly to develop politically and on 1 January next year the transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> will be made to the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the Northern Territory will be getting in January are 95 per cent the result of the efforts of the Labor Government in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are now to be handed on are being handed on as a result of the setting up of a joint committee concerning the Northern Territory by the Labor Government in its period in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In addressing himself to this clause prior to the suspension of the sitting- I was listening to him in my room-  Senator Kilgariff  criticised the Whitlam Government for not giving executive <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to remind  Senator Kilgariff,  as  Senator Keeffe  did a few moments ago, that it was the Whitlam Government which set up a joint parliamentary committee to look into executive <span class="highlight">powers</span> for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Keeffe  and I religiously stuck to our duties to bring about a fully elected Legislative Assembly in the Northern Territory and to give it certain <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Kilgariff  has now criticised the Whitlam Government for not giving the Northern Territory executive <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Northern Territory Legislative Assembly is now a fully elected body and now has certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> because of the actions of the Whitlam Labor Government, not because of the actions of a previous Liberal-Country Party Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have pointed out, in relation to this clause, that we were frustrated in our efforts to give the Northern Territory certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> and we were also frustrated in our efforts to give it representation in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did everything that it could possibly do to give certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are giving the Legislative Assembly certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will also be granted all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> presently available to either the Minister or the Australian Broadcasting Control Board for the administration of the ownership and control provisions applicable to broadcasting licences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be for land councils to exercise <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the Bill and Northern Territory laws will not affect their rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-82-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is vital that there be no hesitancy in the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth to vest State authorities with the power to collect the levies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-84-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Button  took the view that it is a sensible function to place in a quasi judicial tribunal the rights which were held, as well as on some other <span class="highlight">powers</span>, by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board previously, and that the Tribunal will operate as a quasi judicial body in dealing with licences- the creation and change of licences- and, if necessary, the removal of licences where the rules are not complied with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to the establishment of the Tribunal there is a proposal for the establishment of a broadcasting council- a council to represent views, but of course it will not be given <span class="highlight">powers</span> to determine or to dictate the nature of the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have watched my children and I know that although the television screen mesmerises them, the programs they really enjoy are the programs that tease their imaginations, their <span class="highlight">powers</span> to learn, their <span class="highlight">powers</span> to investigate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-This Bill is the first of two stages of a legislative program to implement fully the Government’s decision on the revised administrative structure, including the transfer to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal of the present ministerial <span class="highlight">powers</span> relating to various matters associated with the renewal, suspension and revocation of licences and other matters concerned with changes in ownership and control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that during the second stage of the legislative program it is intended that there be a transfer to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal of the present ministerial <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recent amendments to the Northern Territory Fisheries Ordinance has (i) restricted the number of commercial licences that can be granted to barramundi fishermen for fishing inland waters; and (ii) increased the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of Inspectors in respect to search and seizure of equipment suspected of being used in illegal fishing operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-88-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister advise whether a wife has mandatory <span class="highlight">powers</span> to deny the issue of a passport to her husband or vice versa? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It abolishes the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, sets up the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and gives to that Tribunal in the interim period, prior to further legislation, virtually the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assuming that we follow the pattern set in the other place and the Bill is passed by the Senate the Commission will have modified consultative <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation proposes to transfer the Board’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> of licensing to a statutory authority, and no one argues against that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, it proposes to transfer the Board’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> of inquiry to a statutory body, and no one argues against that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition it proposes to transfer the Board’s technical <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Postal and Telecommunications Department, and there is no dialogue against that at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator is suggesting that when the Government transfers some of the Control Board’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the new Tribunal is must appoint to the Tribunal the same persons who were on the Control Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that suggestion were accepted, the Government would be inhibited in deciding who was suitable for appointment to the Tribunal with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that it will have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be an interim period in which the Tribunal will have the same <span class="highlight">powers</span> as the Board had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was constantly claimed in defence of the Broadcasting Control Board that it had fallen down on its job to police that requirement because of some weakness in the <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred on the Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the proposed Tribunal have been more rigidly expressed in a clear way in the Bill before us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does change much of the distribution of <span class="highlight">powers</span> within broadcasting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">powers</span>, I feel, are pretty wide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(1) For the purposes of this Act, there shall be a Council, to be known as the Broadcasting Council, which, subject to this Act, shall have and may exercise the rights, <span class="highlight">powers</span>, authorities and functions conferred upon it by this Act and shall be charged with and perform the duties and obligations imposed upon it by this Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The exercise of the rights, <span class="highlight">powers</span>, authorities or functions, or the performance of the duties or obligations, of the Council shall not be affected by reason only of there being a vacancy in the office of a member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> we have suggested for it are taken holus-bolus from the Government’s own inquiry, the Green inquiry into broadcasting and television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think they are reasonable and sensible <span class="highlight">powers</span> for a body of this kind to have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that the Regulations and Ordinances Committee of this Senate has constantly complained about major <span class="highlight">powers</span> being left to regulation and not being set out in statutes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unfortunate that these <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the existence of this Council are not provided for in the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators know, there is to be a transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> from the Commonwealth Government to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly on 1 January. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Several statutory bodies, the police and various other departments, will be transferred as part of the initial transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since that date that report more or less has been the bible for developing the transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That matter is to be worked out during the transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend the Government for this initiative that it has taken- a very firm initiative- to ensure in this coming year that after the transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> we will have a strong Northern Territory Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a most important step for the Northern Territory, following as it does the decision of the Labor Government to establish a fully elected Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and to arrange for the transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to give the people of the Northern Territory greater involvement in the decision-making process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am concerned about the Minister’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> to override the Public Service Act and to transfer officers against will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister outline the results of talks held by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly’s Executive Member for Finance and Community Development with Treasury Officials, concerning financial arrangements connected with the transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Assembly, and, in particular, give details of (a) the level of revenue that the Territory will be expected to collect; (b) details of tax sharing arrangements; (c) whether consideration has been given to the provision of specific purpose grants; and (d) the level of funding which it is estimated that will be needed to support a Northern Territory Public Service for the first 5 years of the new arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-12">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As the Director of Projects for the Australian Film Commission,  Mr John  Daniell, has informed members of the advisory panel on the Women ‘s Film Fund that they have no decision-making <span class="highlight">powers</span> regarding sponsorship of projects by the Fund, by what means will the original objective of the Fund, i.e., assistance for production of worthwhile women’s films that have no alternative source of assistance, be safeguarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-64-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, as I have said, a fundamental problem facing the Commonwealth Government is the fact that it does not have the <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the Constitution to carry out, by any means fully, the principles contained in this covenant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 29 ensures that, for reasons of safety of life and of navigation, the provisions of the Navigation Act giving the Minister <span class="highlight">powers</span> regarding the removal of wreck will still apply to any wreck, whether declared historic or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister is not to exercise any of those <span class="highlight">powers</span> unless it is necessary to do so for purposes of safety or environmental emergency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another clause ensures that his <span class="highlight">powers</span> to deal with oil pollution threats arising from damaged ships continue unrestricted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In raising that question I am also a little sceptical as to whether the big <span class="highlight">powers</span>, after they sign these conventions, really regard them as more than a scrap of paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no illusions that countries such as Australia which sign this agreement will endeavour to live up to it, but we might find that if trade is involved- this was the case with France- most of the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> will look the other way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I complained on behalf of the Yugoslav community and asked for action under aviation <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears to be based on a relatively static situation and assumes no substantial change in the relationship of the superpowers or their allies over the next 10 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, there appears to be, according to the Paper, little prospect of an agreement between the 2 super-<span class="highlight">powers</span>, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America, to limit existing armaments in the Indian Ocean or to deal with any possible build-up in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If any agreements can be reached then the United States, for example, although remaining strong militarily, might not be able to supply as much manpower, technical and equipment support to the countries with whom it has normally been associated as friendly <span class="highlight">powers</span> as it has done in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find that the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> such as the United States of America, Japan and probably the Soviet Union regard as important free and unhindered access to certain areas such as the Arabian Gulf, Indonesia, Malacca and the Sunda and Lombok Straits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that there will be a nuclear holocaust between the major <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Littoral states on the Indian Ocean have varying relationships with the Super <span class="highlight">Powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are now talking about the ‘Super <span class="highlight">Powers</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we would wish to see the Super <span class="highlight">Powers</span> exercise restraint in their activities so that their deployments may be maintained at the lowest practicable level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all this discussion about the super <span class="highlight">powers</span> that we have in this document, does anybody seriously believe that one super power can go into the Indian Ocean in the way in which the U.S. has already gone-through its installations at North West Cape for example, which this Government wants it to add to by establishing a base in Diego Garcia- without inviting the Soviet Union to come into the Indian Ocean? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say we ought to follow the sort of policies put forward by the Indian Government which have been supported by the Government of Sri Lanka; that is, that all the super <span class="highlight">powers</span> should get out of the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be very difficult to talk about getting the super <span class="highlight">powers</span> out of the Atlantic or the Mediterranean or the north Pacific, but it is completely feasible to talk about getting the super <span class="highlight">powers</span> out of the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is still inviting the two super <span class="highlight">powers</span> to build up a conflagration of some sort around the shores of the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to talk in these terms about Australia as if it were a super power or as if we ought to be part of some arrangements with super <span class="highlight">powers</span> which would bring them into the part of the world in which we live, could be disastrous for this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way in which we can secure our defence is by our foreign policy, by taking steps to see that the super <span class="highlight">powers</span> are not in the Indian Ocean, whatever may happen with Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The greatest chances of conflagration of a major nature will come because of disputes between super <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his usual eloquent manner he talked mainly about the super <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the possibility of conflagration between the super <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is perfectly obvious that if this world ever gets to the point where there is a conflagration between the super <span class="highlight">powers</span>- that description is not only used in the defence White Paper but also it is commonly used in the  Daily Mirror  and the Press around Australia- then Australia’s hopes of survival lie purely and simply in its capacity over the years to impress its more powerful allies that it is a place which is worth saving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I think that a concentration on a possible massive conflict between the super <span class="highlight">powers</span> is somewhat unnecessary in the terms of this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed,  Senator Wheeldon  put the interesting proposition that, rather than seeking a matching presence in the Indian Ocean between the super-<span class="highlight">powers</span> it would be far better if those super-<span class="highlight">powers</span> abandoned any form of presence in the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But where is the guarantee that if the super-<span class="highlight">powers</span>, with their present relatively small capacities there, move out of the Indian Ocean the other littoral States around the Indian Ocean will not involve themselves in a constant and continuing conflict? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can see no logical reason why it should be assumed that if the superpowers withdrew from the Indian Ocean there would then be a sea of peace because there would then be no other navies- and there are significant navies and air forces and also nuclear capacities- around the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that that would be so, and I tend to the view that in the foreseeable future the best security of this country and of many of the littoral States of the Indian Ocean lies in their capacity to ensure that there is a measure of matching power in the Indian Ocean between the super-<span class="highlight">powers</span> at a low level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the attention of honourable senators to the fact that unless we are capable of establishing and are determined to establish a responsible defence pattern and a responsible level of selfreliance we cannot expect greater friends and allies and mightier <span class="highlight">powers</span> to come to our succour should there ever be- and God forbid that there ever will be- a massive conflagration around the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a variety of reasons much will depend on how China, the closest of the external <span class="highlight">powers</span>, decides to pursue its interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any concessions made to imperialist <span class="highlight">powers</span> will be made in the form of hard bargaining that extracts every ounce of advantage for the Chinese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fear is that, if the United States regards South East Asia as an area of low priority, the only two major <span class="highlight">powers</span> left to compete are the Soviet Union and China, without the balancing effect of the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could well be that Vietnam will be a more destabilising influence in South East Asia than will the other <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The threat was the war in Vietnam, Chinese communist expansion and the expansion of various <span class="highlight">powers</span> in South East Asia, <span class="highlight">powers</span> which were never identified, as  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack failed to identify them tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall move a motion which is contained in the body of the report and which is designed to resolve and repeat what was and is the position with regard to the understanding of the Committee and, I think, the understanding of the Senate as to the Senate’s respective <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That committee investigated the background of the matter and reported on what ought to be the differentiation between these particular <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in the years ahead we may have to look at some kind of separation of <span class="highlight">powers</span> within the Australian system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill places in the hands of the  Chairman  of the Public Service Board extensive <span class="highlight">powers</span> for which apparently under this legislation he is not accountable to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What referendum proposals are generally all about is the transfer of further and other <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the federal governmentpowers which the State governments previously had as part of their residual <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first duty of an honourable senator coming here is to defend the proper responsibilities and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we have the situation where people are to vote on this matter- if the Government is supported by the vast majority in this place- when the debate in this place has special responsibilities because now the Senate is challenged as to its <span class="highlight">powers</span>, authorities and responsibilities, and when the Government which is proposing these measures 2 years ago called them a fraud, then in a unique situation of Senate responsibility and for the elucidation of the allegations as to whether it was fraud, why not let the people hear what we have to say on each of these matters? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would cut out the constitutional independence of the Senate and open the way for progressive reduction of its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that we do have a different view of the role of the Senate; we do have a different view of the role of government and the way government should function in this country, and we do have a very strong view that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate should be delimited at every opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 7 December 1976  (Hansard,  page 2694)  Senator Sibraa  asked me, as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Federal Affairs, a question without notice concerning  the referral of wage fixing <span class="highlight">powers</span> by the States to the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government has not sought a referral of wage fixing <span class="highlight">powers</span> from the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Commonwealth Government were to consider more direct wage fixing <span class="highlight">powers</span> necessary, then the approach the honourable senator speaks of would be one of the options open to the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the standing committee has no statutory <span class="highlight">powers</span>, I believe it has received the cooperation of the directors of major research institutions, such as the CSIRO and the Hall Institute in Victoria, and of the vice-chancellors of the various universities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That inquiry would not extend- I do not think that it could extend- beyond the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this Parliament nor deal with matters that come with the responsibility of the Queensland Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it envisaged that an election at large will be held under the regulation making <span class="highlight">powers</span> in section 219 of the existing Commonwealth Electoral Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam  in 1973 at the height of his <span class="highlight">powers</span> threatened this action on occasions when he seemed to have a great deal of support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I do not believe that the irrational fears that somehow we as the Senate will lose rights or <span class="highlight">powers</span> will result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it incredible that the present Government should introduce this Constitution Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill which radically weakens and undermines the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it completely beyond belief when that decision comes so soon after the Senate, in what I think was the most worthy exercise of its <span class="highlight">powers</span>, used the express reserve power of rejection to give the people an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore we find that this legislation has not been considered in relation to the probable next steps of a Labor Government whose spokesmen on this debate, such as  Senator Button,  have avowed that this Labor Party will take every opportunity to delimit the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will show that this is a Bill not for simultaneous elections, but to erode the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say at once that in my opposition to this proposal in the Constitutional Review Committee, I made it plain- I circulated the text of my remarks to honourable senators 2 days ago- I have no objection to simultaneous elections as such; what I have objection to is using that rather superficially attractive expression to induce people to adopt a Bill, when the real effect of it ls to undermine the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and give the go-by to section 57. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This deals with one of the cardinal <span class="highlight">powers</span> of a State in relation to the States’ House in the Federal Parliament where each State has equal representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To show the extent to which the State legislatures have exercised those <span class="highlight">powers</span>, I refer to one of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">powers</span> are checks and balances against any concentration of unbridled power in the Executive Government, or against any misuse of power or mismanagement by a Government … <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the age-old struggle between Parliament and the Executive, the Senate must continue to be vigilant in safeguarding its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having revealed the true purpose and operation of this Bill to be firstly, to take a power from the States and give it to the Commonwealth and, secondly, not to relate to elections but to relate to a half dissolution of the Senate, I say that this is the occasion when we should make ourselves clear in saying that we will be vigilant in safeguarding the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate from erosion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today we have 2 Houses of Parliament with the same <span class="highlight">powers</span>, doing the same job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, senators will be given an opportunity at a later time to test their genuineness about whether they want simultaneous elections or whether they feel that what  Senator Button  and  Senator Cavanagh  said is true, that is, that the net result of carrying this referendum in the electorate would be the emasculation of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate and the significant transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> from the States to the central Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>would cut out the constitutional independence of the Senate and open the way for progressive reduction of its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They said that the danger of the proposal for simultaneous elections, as it was drafted by the then Whitlam Government and as it is now proposed by the Fraser Government, was that it represented a threat to the power of the Senate and also a threat to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and rights of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree that if it is possible we do not wish to take away the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate, particularly as it is the forum for the smaller States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our system of parliamentary government is based on the principle of separation of <span class="highlight">powers</span> and in the evolution of that system it had been decided in the past, and it is reiterated time and again, that it is essential that there be some proper separation of the functions of the Executive and the legislature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate will remain basically as they are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was only because of the far-sightedness of postwar Prime Minister Ben Chifley that we used defence <span class="highlight">powers</span> to create the Snowy Mountains project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are issues which affect the fundamental integrity of the Senate, its <span class="highlight">powers</span> and its ability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite concerned that there should be no breakdown of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The traditional independent <span class="highlight">powers</span> and voice of the Senate would be lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the role of the Senate and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate, arising from the events of 11 November 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not matters for vituperation; they are matters for serious consideration in the community as to the proper role of the Senate and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I defend the rights and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Scott  pointed out in the debate earlier today, those rights and <span class="highlight">powers</span> are not affected by this referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is easy to talk in general terms about how the Senate’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> will be reduced by this Bill and associated Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we couple with the untrammelled power of the Federal Parliament to appoint times for the holding of Senate elections the provisions in clause 4 of the Bill which give the other <span class="highlight">powers</span>, then we really bring in a shortened term for honourable senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-50-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 1 January 1977 the Federal Government commenced the transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> of State-like nature to the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the recommendatons of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Northern Territory relating to the transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span>, what are the present situation and future plans for the transfer of repsonsibilities in regard to education? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In consequence of that goal the Government has set up a series of co-ordinating programs to provide steadily for the transfer of various <span class="highlight">powers</span> and for the ultimate assumption of <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These Departments will work within a co-ordinating atmosphere of interdepartmental relationships to develop plans consistent with the transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> in a time scale as indicated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1974, words similar to what  Senator Wright  has just said moved senior members of the then Opposition, who are now members of the Government, to say that the Constitution Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill should be opposed because it was a direct attack on the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this chamber and would substantially transfer power from the States and from the States’ Houses to the Executive Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the honourable senator to have a look at a very detailed speech which  Sir John  Kerr made to, I think, the Indian Law Society on a visit to India a couple of years ago and in which he enunciated his view of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and duties of the Governor-General in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Button  said that he was very pleased that perhaps this legislation would erode some of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number one priority for him is the retention of the present <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate; and the number 2 priority is what is good for the public and for the good of government in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and we - that is the Australian Labor Party- do have a very strong view that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate should be delimited at every opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless the Government is intent upon adopting the strong view of the Australian Labor Party, as put by  Senator Button,  that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate should be delimited at every opportunity, which is the basic reason the Opposition is supporting the legislation, there is no intelligible reason why any one of these amendments should be refused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is every State Police Commissioner in Australia in favour of the Federal Government granting police limited <span class="highlight">powers</span> to tap telephones in Australia, subject to judicial oversight, as was suggested by the former Queensland Police Commissioner,  Mr Ray  Whitrod, at his farewell Press conference in Brisbane on 29 November 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Federal Government refused permission for these <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be granted; (b) What would be the advantages of providing police with power to tap telephones in certain circumstances; (c) What would be the disadvantages of so doing; and (d) Does the Attorney-General intend reviewing this matter in the foreseeable future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is even more essential that those who make public opinion- business and labour leaders and the media which interpret them- should cease aggravating the gloom, and acknowledge the economic progress which is being made (even though some may consider that the chosen official policies are imperfect) and refrain from asking governments to deliver what is beyond their <span class="highlight">powers</span> to deliver. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are problems because this Parliament operates as a legislative body over only certain aspects of life and the State parliaments have considerable <span class="highlight">powers</span> in areas where human rights also may be affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill at that time endeavoured to sweep aside this distinction and to impose <span class="highlight">powers</span> which were regarded by State parliaments as an infringement of their rights and responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am a great believer in the Standing Orders and if we adopt what is now suggested we will be taking away some of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of our Standing Orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we are to take what is a right regarding incorporations away from the  President  we will take away some of his decision making <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The last 25 years were dominated by the tension between the super <span class="highlight">powers</span> in an essentially bi-polar world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ability of the super <span class="highlight">powers</span> to control other states and to determine the agenda of international politics has diminished perceptibly, and they are being forced to give less attention to each other and more to third parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They would not agree to giving increased <span class="highlight">powers</span> to Federal government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not understand the full emphasis of the devolvement of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some 2 weeks ago a delegation from this Federal Parliament led by  Mr Speaker  Snedden, the  President  of the Senate,  Senator Laucke,  the Minister for the Northern Territory,  Mr Evan  Adermann, and many other people attended the opening of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly to mark an important milestone for the Northern Territory on 1 January this year when there was the initial transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> from the Federal Government to the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the beginning of the transfer of federal <span class="highlight">powers</span> of a State-like nature to the people of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be a gradual transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> and as the Territory accepts new challenges and responsibilities it will go up the ladder to its ultimate goal of statehood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As time goes by we will see more <span class="highlight">powers</span> transferred until the ultimate of statehood is achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that State <span class="highlight">powers</span> are not going to be interferred with in any way at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I read  President  Carter’s statement on this issue it made me wonder about the effect of conservative government policies on foreign relations and to observe how those policies have been drastically altered in Australia by the actions of foreign <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In actual fact, most of the initiatives, especially those in relation to important issues such as the Sino-Soviet dispute that I mentioned or the presence of super <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the Indian Ocean, have been shown to be tailored to lead to greater instability, less co-operation and a heightened threat of conflict in our area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The Government is now hiding behind his <span class="highlight">powers</span> and not upholding them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Such a dangerous law would vitally affect the parliamentary system; it would cut out the Constitutional independence of the Senate and open the way for progressive reduction of its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The traditional independent <span class="highlight">powers</span> and voice of the Senate would be lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say to  Senator Messner  who is trying to interject that the woolgrowers simply ask that the Australian Wool Corporation be given <span class="highlight">powers</span> of acquisition over all wool destined for export. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The serious constitutional question that we have to face is before sub-committee D of the Constitutional Convention and relates to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But really we ought to be talking about the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate and what ought to happen in the resolution of deadlocks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, the major change has been that there is no longer the situation whereby we have the polarisation between 2 super <span class="highlight">powers</span>, with nearly all of the rest of the world belonging to one camp or the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Indian Ocean which is relatively unimportant among the world’s great oceans and is not bordered by any of the super <span class="highlight">powers</span>- I include China as a super power in this respect- we have an opportunity to achieve a demilitarised zone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn aside for a moment to comment on the fact that there has been a shift in the emphasis on the conflict between the super <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The super <span class="highlight">powers</span> basically have been concerned one with the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the emphasis of the super <span class="highlight">powers</span>, one to the other, tends to change I hope that they do not become involved in circumstances in which a super power promotes a set of circumstances in some other part of the world through the use of a third or fourth party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was so particularly when we discussed this question of the relative strength of navies and the super <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is still happening between the major <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are tensions between Russia and China, 2 major <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when we look at the competition which has taken place, the power seeking of these 2 major <span class="highlight">powers</span>, the events in South East Asia and in so many of the African states, we question how much validity there is in that argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How much danger would there be in the world from what would then be the major super <span class="highlight">powers</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recognise that the U.S.A. is one of the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the main things we found was that it was not only the super <span class="highlight">powers</span> that were trying to project this perception of power in the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The assumption seems to be that if the super-<span class="highlight">powers</span>, and presumably all other <span class="highlight">powers</span>, remove all their forces and facilities it will then be a zone of peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there is the question of what future attitude regional <span class="highlight">powers</span> might adopt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that the United States should agree to the proposal; secondly, that the Soviet Union should agree to the proposal; and, thirdly, that both super-<span class="highlight">powers</span> then should completely remove all their forces, bases and any other facilities from the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was able to gain the confidence of countries which were a little wary of the super <span class="highlight">powers</span>, whether it was the United States, the Soviet Union or China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It always amazes me that little countries like Peru and Iceland snub their noses at the big <span class="highlight">powers</span> and get away with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only will they create a general feeling that they are not entitled to statehood but also they will create an impression in the minds of the Australian public that the Assembly is not a fit and proper body to have State-like <span class="highlight">powers</span> passed to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The concept of a ‘family court’ is well established in the United States of America, Canada and Japan though there are variations in the proceedings and <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the High Court has found some deficiencies and therefore there is some difficulty, particularly in regard to property and custody where some of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> cannot be exercised at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They would need to recognise their responsibility in developing a new type of court, acting with a minimum of formality, co-ordinating the work of ancillary specialists attached to the court, encouraging conciliation and applying, only as a last resort, the judicial <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was apparent to the Committee from the evidence given that both  Mr Bryant  and  Mr Dexter  had similar views on their <span class="highlight">powers</span> and responsibilities under section 64 of the Constitution and section 25 (2) of the Public Service Act respectively, but that in the exercising of those <span class="highlight">powers</span> and responsibilities there were significant differences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite apart from the problems which arose out of the conflict of <span class="highlight">powers</span> and responsibilities of the former Minister and the permanent head, the Committee was concerned with the conclusions reached by the Auditor-General over the expenditure on the turtle and crocodile projects during the period September 1970 to June 1973, which projects were established prior to  Mr Bryant  becoming Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Council possesses only advisory <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that this is not just political window dressing, that it is not a black decoration and that the advisory committee will be given very wide <span class="highlight">powers</span>, even if only at the recommendatory level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The reason for  Senator Wriedt  ‘s insensate hatred of federalism is that he knows that every step we take to diffuse <span class="highlight">powers</span>, to strengthen the State governments and local government, will make it more difficult for a doctrinaire socialist government of the future, God forbid, to bring about its policies of destruction and amalgamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer to the specific question asked by  Senator Tehan  is that there are <span class="highlight">powers</span> and procedures under conciliation and arbitration legislation to deal with matters of this kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall, there are the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the courts before whom prosecutions come will have to determine what are the penalties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the problem which arises if, in pursuance of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which would be vested in the Minister under clause 9 (2) of the Bill, the appropriate instrument were published in the  Gazette  permitting the recruitment in Australia of persons to serve overseas in a manner which is otherwise precluded by the provisions of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Government’s view sub-clause (2 ) of clause 9 is to be read subject to clause 6, and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> under sub-clause (2) of clause 9 are subject to that situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We submit that in this territory and elsewhere in the South- West Pacific surrender arrangements should not prejudice readjustments found desirable in the interests of security and welfare always subject, naturally, to the consent of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> concerned.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Arrangements are currently being made with the Public Service Board for the delegation of certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Bureau with respect to the engagement of experts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the conditions of (2) have not been adhered to, what <span class="highlight">powers</span> has the Minister to ensure that the time schedule mentioned in (2 ) is adhered to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-47-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the States do not opt for the personal income taxing <span class="highlight">powers</span> that apply under stage 2, is the Minister saying, in effect, that the federalism policy will not come into effect, at least not in the foreseeable future? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or, alternatively, does he agree with the statement by the Prime Minister which appeared in the New South Wales  Country Life  of 25 August last year when the Prime Minister, in answer to the question ‘Would you like the <span class="highlight">powers</span> to negotiate price and wage freezes with employers and unionists? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The High Court ruled that the Director-General of Social Security, acting under Government instructions, exceeded his <span class="highlight">powers</span> in denying unemployment benefit to all school leavers for up to 3 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has been exposed in a breach of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the law and has been exposed to be in defiance of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question is, then, whether this general rule is no more than a permissible instruction by the Director-General to those to whom he has delegated his <span class="highlight">powers</span> under s. 107 (c) as to how they are to determine whether they are satisfied of the matters there referred to; or whether on the contrary it reveals an attempted substitution of inconsistent departmental criteria for those which the Parliament has enacted as appropriate to qualify an applicant for unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so, it should be remarked that the function of the Director-General under s. 107 is to be distinguished from that of tribunals, such as licensing justices, which, in their exercise of discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span> to grant or refuse licences, may give effect to some general policy that they see as desirable so long as in doing so they do not preclude themselves from considering on its merits the exceptional case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless, in addition to its advisory role, the Commission has certain executive <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the area of course approvals and the distribution of funds for approved capital projects within a State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth Government assumed control of income taxation in 1943 and gained <span class="highlight">powers</span> to cover ‘benefits to students’ as a result of an amendment to the Constitution in 1946, one of the few proposals to amend the Constitution which have been accepted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A financial assistance scheme to assist universities following the gaining of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> led to accommodation problems at universities and, after an examination by a committee chaired by Professor Mills, Commonwealth financial grants were made to universities in 195 1. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to the proposal by the Government to grant certain taxing <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bureau will have wide investigative <span class="highlight">powers</span> and, mark my words, a possibly unconstitutional mix of judicial and arbitral <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 15 of the Bill clothes the Court with dragnet consequential order <span class="highlight">powers</span> which in spirit, if not in law, go beyond the essence of the judicial power of the ascertainment, declaration and enforcement of existing rights and obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us take this matter in a sober fashion, bearing in mind that there are very real dangers if governments, State or Federal, should attempt to intrude their legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> to restrict on a campus, student or other action, political or otherwise, because it is very hard to decide what is true academic freedom and what is intimidation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1959  Senator Wright  saw that it was necessary in the interests of the good government of this country if it was to develop as a viable political democracy, if its economy was to develop, to have changes to the industrial <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth; he saw that there would have to be changes to the broadcasting <span class="highlight">powers</span>, to the corporations <span class="highlight">powers</span>, to the marketing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth Government; he saw that the Commonwealth Government should have power over interest rates; he saw that there should be alterations to the provisions of section 92 of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What further <span class="highlight">powers</span> does the Federal Government envisage transferring to the Legislative Assembly for the Northern Territory in the 1977-78 period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-52-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his report,  Mr Justice  Toose recommended that repatriation boards should be abolished and replaced by a system whereby the initial determination of claims should be the responsibility of the Commission exercising its <span class="highlight">powers</span> through suitably qualified persons acting individually as delegates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the <span class="highlight">powers</span> this Senate has at present under the Constitution there is nothing to stop it from again forcing a government to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ever since I became a member of the Senate I have heard  Senator Cormack, Senator Wright  and  Senator Wood,  who sit opposite, preaching about the great <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this Senate as though it were some place away up on high- something from which nothing can be taken away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Today in the other place the Government has brought on a Bill, which was first introduced on 1 8 March, to strengthen the Inspectorate and to convert it into an industrial relations bureau with stronger <span class="highlight">powers</span> designed in fact to enforce action against employees, not against employers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am saying that at the present time there is a Bill before the Parliament- which will be passed in both places- to strengthen the bureau in respect of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> designed, and reported by the Minister, to be aimed at employees in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is now, under the new arrangements which have come about as the result of discussions between the Minister,  Mr Hawke  and leaders of trade unions, to take over the <span class="highlight">powers</span>, no more or no less of the Commonwealth Arbitration Inspectorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">powers</span> have always been available in relation to breaches of awards whether by employers or employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the additional <span class="highlight">powers</span> it is the  President  of the Tribunal who will determine the setting aside of the certificate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> on review given to the Federal Court are quite considerable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difficulty which exists under the existing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of review is that a person may not be able to find out the facts or may not be given any reasons by the tribunal that makes the decision, or the tribunal may not set out the findings of fact so that people can seek proper legal advice to determine whether they have grounds for an appeal or to seek a prerogative writ. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It aims to widen the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the capacities of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation which was set up 12 years ago by a government of Liberal faith and, at the same time, to bring the Corporation into more equitable commercial arrangements with its competitors in the marketplace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, this Bill will substantially widen the Corporation’s <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill will give the Corporation a much extended range of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to make it even more effective and able to insure the full range of housing loans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That arrangement is of course a central element in the Government’s federalism policy which is aimed at restoring a proper distribution of <span class="highlight">powers</span> and responsibilities between the 3 spheres of government- Commonwealth, State and local. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way in which that will be done is for the Senate to misuse continually its <span class="highlight">powers</span> until the people are aware of that misuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Pending the detailed consideration of the Act referred to later in this statement, the Industrial Relations Bureau will have the same <span class="highlight">powers</span> as the Arbitration Inspectorate, no more, no less, and those <span class="highlight">powers</span> will be exercised according to the same processes as they have been until now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> that will be exercised by the Industrial Relations Bureau when it is formed will be the same as those currently exercised by the Arbitration Inspectorate and the processes followed by the Bureau will be those followed by the Arbitration Inspectorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Meat Board has acted entirely within its <span class="highlight">powers</span> in retaining these services and I do not consider any investigation of the matter is necessary or warranted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-46-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Dairy Produce Act 1924 to provide for the establishment of the Australian Dairy Industry Advisory Committee and to make changes in the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Dairy Corporation as part of the new marketing arrangements for the dairy industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A fundamental part of the Stage I arrangements is that the realisations from the export of prescribed products are pooled and provision has therefore been made in this Bill for the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Dairy Corporation to be extended for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The appropriate provisions have been incorporated in this Bill to extend the borrowing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Dairy Corporation to enable it to make advances on all dairy products placed under its control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present the borrowing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Corporation are limited to making advances on product that is purchased by the Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the proposals for reconstituting the Australian Meat Board as an Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation which by virtue of its composition, <span class="highlight">powers</span> and financial arrangements will be adequately equipped to oversee and promote Australian meat and livestock exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An Australian Meat Board was first established by the  Meat Export Control Act  1935, and with the exception of the period from 1943 to 1946 during World War II when the Board went into recess, the Meat Board has continued ever since although various changes in its composition and <span class="highlight">powers</span> have been made from time to time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government responded to calls from all sections of the meat and livestock industry by implementing a review of the functions, <span class="highlight">powers</span> and composition of the Australian Meat Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An appreciation of the extent and nature of developments affecting Australian livestock producers is essential to a full understanding of the changes to composition, functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Meat Board which are provided for in the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Bill 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The composition, functions, <span class="highlight">powers</span> and financial arrangements provided for the Corporation in this Bill are a reflection of a protracted debate with industry organisations and interested individuals which has extended for almost a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot emphasise strongly enough that these divergent viewpoints about structure of the Corporation should not be permitted to overshadow the primary purpose of the Bill which is to streamline the functions, <span class="highlight">powers</span> and financial arrangements of the Australian Meat Board with a view to increasing administrative efficiency and flexibility of operation for the Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Meat Board has always possessed a broad range of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to enable it to control Australian meat exports and to promote meat in both the export and domestic markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bulk of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> have been retained for the Corporation but some changes have been provided for in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Corporation is to have wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> in these areas in respect of meat and it is a logical development for the Corporation to be able to exercise similar <span class="highlight">powers</span> over livestock exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provision has been made for the Minister to give directions to the Corporation in respect of its exercise of these <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although this provision confers broad <span class="highlight">powers</span> on the Minister it is not aimed at curbing the Corporation’s ability to act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without broad control <span class="highlight">powers</span> it would not have been possible for the Australian Meat Board to have fulfilled Australia’s obligations to regulate meat exports to the United States of America under the voluntary restraint and quota arrangements which have existed at various times since 1968. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quality control <span class="highlight">powers</span> have been provided which the Corporation could use as needed to protect Australia’s international trading image. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">powers</span> would include rights of entry and inspection for consistency of product or animal against contract specifications, rights to take samples for purposes of analysis, and recommending a method by which disputes relating to product standards arising between overseas buyers and Australian suppliers could be settled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason, the Bill has been framed with the intention that the Corporation would only use its control <span class="highlight">powers</span> when it considered such action to be necessary to further the interests of Australian livestock producers and Australian industries concerned with the preparation of meat for export or the export of meat or livestock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pending the outcome of a review of Australia’s overseas cargo shipping legislation which has been implemented by the Government, provision has been made for exercise of the shipping contract <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be subject to the approval of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in line with the Government’s commitment to the free enterprise system, the Corporation will only be able to exercise these <span class="highlight">powers</span> if such trading is in accordance with commercial practice and consistent with a trading policy adopted by the Corporation and made known to the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A report of an Inspector under this section shall be considered by the member of the Commission where it is relevant to the performance of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and duties of the member under this Act and, unless there are special circumstances which in his opinion render it undesirable to do so, the member shall make the report public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Button- jointly or severally with  Senator Georges,  I am not sure which- raised the question of <span class="highlight">powers</span> granted under clause  5,  which proposes a new section  54. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised that clause 5, by reference to other sections, contains the same <span class="highlight">powers</span> as exist at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We assume- I reiterate this point for the purposes of the record, if nothing else- that that reference to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Bureau will be construed in the light of the statement by the Minister that these <span class="highlight">powers</span> will be no more or less than the <span class="highlight">powers</span> exercised by the inspector whom the Bureau is to replace and whose function is now to be exercised by the Bureau. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At an earlier stage when the legislation was being discussed, I was facetious enough to suggest to the Minister- 1 hesitate to recall it- that Norman Gunston might be an appropriate figure to direct the Industrial Relations Bureau; that is, when it had its full <span class="highlight">powers</span> and was in its full glory under the legislation as it was previously drafted and not under the emasculated Bill which we now have before us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With all these industrial stoppages that are going on, with wages going up, with profits going down, with manufacturing industry being ruined, with the whole country going to the dogs, with the work ethic declining, the Government is hiding behind the head of this Industrial Relations Bureau and saying: “It has nothing to do with us; it is all his fault because he has not been exercising the <span class="highlight">powers</span> properly”.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer particularly, of course, to proposed section 1 26f which deals with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the GovernorGeneral to suspend or remove the Director for misbehaviour or incapacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his second reading speech the Minister pointed out that the Bureau will have exactly the same <span class="highlight">powers</span> as the Arbitration Inspectorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder how far the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Director of the Industrial Relations Bureau are to extend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to any <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are conferred on it by any other provision of this Act, the Bureau has power to do all things necessary or convenient to be done to enable it to perform its function and, in particular, may institute proceedings before any court of competent jurisdiction for an offence against this Act or the regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It related to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Director of the Industrial Relations Bureau and the fact that there was no real ministerial responsibility for that Director. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first refers to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> under proposed new section 126c enabling the Bureau to institute proceedings for offences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bureau definitely is included in those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Industrial Relations Bureau will have the same <span class="highlight">powers</span> as the Arbitration Inspectorate, no more no less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main point I want to make about the establishment of the National Labour Consultative Council is that it has, as part of its specific terms of reference or <span class="highlight">powers</span>, the responsibility for consultation on industrial relations matters and manpower matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regard the reference in clause 5 of the proposed Bill to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Council to deal with manpower matters as being most significant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wright  accepts at the present time that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are now in existence should be terminated, but he wants the application of the law of torts and compensation so that anyone who dares to take strike action is put in debt or imprisoned for the rest of his life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were prepared to accept it as taking over the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Arbitration Inspectorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition does not oppose the new National Labour Consultative Council because it knows that it is an attempt to establish again something like the old National Labour Advisory Body, which was set up during my time on the ACTU Executive and which was supported to the stage when the ACTU and the unions considered that the then Government was using too powerfully the penal <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Pending the detailed consideration of the Act referred to later in this statement, the Industrial Relations Bureau will have the same <span class="highlight">powers</span> as the Arbitration Inspectorate, no more, no less, and those <span class="highlight">powers</span> will be exercised according to the same processes as they have been until now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>yesterday the Federal Government’s new industrial legislation provided for an increase in <span class="highlight">powers</span> it already had but did not use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Employers frequently do not use the Act or the penal <span class="highlight">powers</span> contained in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They know that there is more chance of settling a dispute without recourse to threats and penal <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the employers want to take action to fine the unions and to use the sanction <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I understand that even  Senator Wright,  in a most aggressively critical speech of the Government’s proposal, has said that he does not agree with the amendment in respect of ministerial <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Bishop  said a little earlier, it will have the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Arbitration Inspectorate, but it will be a statutory body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bureau is to have the same <span class="highlight">powers</span> as the Arbitration Inspectorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inspectors have been assigned <span class="highlight">powers</span> to make inspections, examinations, investigations and inquiries and to interview people to determine whether the Act is being observed or whether an offence is suspected, and several other <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are really very strong <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, these are very strong <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No, not Malcolm Fraser in 1977 but Stanley Melbourne Bruce in May 1928, when he was introducing a Bill that increased Federal <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the conciliation and arbitration system and imposed proper controls on the unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We oppose it because it is a breach of the agreement and it does not provide the same <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the inspectorate had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation is going to separate, by way of a statutory authority, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that were within the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will put those <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the hands of a bureau, away from the influence of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, so that he can disclaim all responsibility for what happens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government intends to place unlimited <span class="highlight">powers</span> to initiate in the hands of the Bureau. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The industrial movement does not realise that it will be a separate statutory body which will carry out and supervise the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the existing legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The penalties within the existing legislation are draconic enough without any of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the Government had proposed and subsequently withdrawn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The existing <span class="highlight">powers</span> are sufficient to cause confrontation after confrontation within the industrial movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do not do anything to limit their bargaining <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Pending the detailed consideration of the Act referred to later in this statement, the Industrial Relations Bureau will have the same <span class="highlight">powers</span> as the Arbitration Inspectorate, no more and no less, and those <span class="highlight">powers</span> will be exercised according to the same processes as they have been until now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If this Council is to be established it ought to have <span class="highlight">powers</span> to co-opt experts when it is considering matters of vital interest to organisations affected by amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, in clause 27, the Bill confers a further new function on these committees by providing for the existing <span class="highlight">powers</span>, functions and procedures of the medical services committees of inquiry to be extended to conduct investigations into excessive requesting of pathology services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 4 provides the Minister with discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span> to approve road works. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister may- give directions to the Commission in connexion with the performance of its functions or the exercise of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this Act, not including, except as mentioned in paragraph (a), functions or <span class="highlight">powers</span> related directly or indirectly to Part VII. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While that is being done I ask the Committee to direct its attention to the interpretation of paragraph (b) of clause  20,  which states: give directions to the Commission in connexion with the performance of its functions or the exercise of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this Act - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>functions or <span class="highlight">powers</span> related directly or indirectly to Part VII. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without complementary State legislation to cover the whole field, this legislation cannot be fully effective, because the Commonwealth’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> extend only to corporations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this trade practices legislation does nothing to control corporations I believe its <span class="highlight">powers</span> will be limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that these judicial <span class="highlight">powers</span> about which we are speaking weaken the ability of the Commission to pursue vital lines of prosecution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a reduction of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to subpoena witnesses and documents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How is the Government going to bring a big corporation to account, especially a trans-national corporation, after limiting the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government accepts that the Commission is a worthwhile commission and that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Act are worth while-I questioned that- I cannot understand why the Government wants to diminish the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission any further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, as I said, the Act is so confusing and its <span class="highlight">powers</span> are so ill-defined, of course it needs to have a Commission which is substantially supported with resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that the Commission is fully geared at the present time to carry out its <span class="highlight">powers</span>, such as they are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All this legislation with draconic <span class="highlight">powers</span> were available to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Meal and Livestock Corporation should be given <span class="highlight">powers</span> to trade on the home market allowing the States and Territories to approve enabling complementary legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new corporation is to have much wider <span class="highlight">powers</span>, particularly over livestock exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Corporation has much wider trading <span class="highlight">powers</span>, and these will be assisted by its right to borrow money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also will have much wider <span class="highlight">powers</span> over the control of shipping, and this too is quite important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister may give directions to the Corporation concerning the performance of the functions and the exercise of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the Corporation shall comply with those directions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister may give directions to the Corporation concerning the performance of the functions and the exercise of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the Corporation shall comply with those directions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Archer went on to say that if that amendment was agreed to we would be giving the Minister some outlandish <span class="highlight">powers</span>, that he would be able to do all sorts of things with the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Corporation may adopt such policy as it determines with respect to the exercise by it of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred on it by sub-section ( 1 ), and shall not exercise those <span class="highlight">powers</span> otherwise than in accordance with the policy adopted, or last adopted, by it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister may give directions to the Corporation concerning the performance of the functions and the exercise of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the Corporation shall comply with those directions’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That provision limits the Minister’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> to deal only with those occasions when the Corporation might want to operate outside ordinary commercial practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of the Australian Capital Territory there is not even any executive or administrative body that could administer a territorial legal aid commission because we are still waiting on the Fraser Government to decide on the devolution of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to a territorial assembly of the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>to advise the Attorney-General as to the educational programs that would be effective in promoting an understanding by the public, or by sections of the public that have special needs in this respect, of their rights, <span class="highlight">powers</span>, privileges and duties under laws in force in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are now in this Bill are a useful basis upon which the Attorney can negotiate and endeavour to obtain proper conditions for those who have served the Commonwealth well in legal aid and who need to be protected, who need to have the right, if necessary, to go back into the Commonwealth Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission cannot perform any worthwhile coordinating role since it has no direct <span class="highlight">powers</span>, and indeed there is nothing in the Bill to clarify how the Commonwealth intends to achieve its professed goal of co-ordinating of legal aid services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this is the case does it not indicate a servile piece of conduct by the Australian Government towards foreign <span class="highlight">powers</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Instead of legislating on the whole question of land rights in accordance with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the referendum gave it, this Federal Government is handing some of this responsibility to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fancy a lawyer coming into this place and defending the provisions contained in this Bill which give arbitrary <span class="highlight">powers</span> to an employing authority and to any. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will start new grievances because in future the employing authority and the delegation of bosses will have new <span class="highlight">powers</span> over the worker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The expression ‘employing authority’ in this legislation has to be seen in connection with the provisions of clause 13 of the Bill which provides that the employing authority may, either generally or otherwise, delegate to a person all its <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this Act other than the power of delegation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could be a person from the Minister- or for that matter any Minister, if the legislation is to be relied on- down to a relatively insignificant person down the chain of authority in Commonwealth employment to whom these <span class="highlight">powers</span> may be delegated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of industrial actions by public servants and Commonwealth employees in recent times have led the Government to believe that it needs to have the <span class="highlight">powers</span> provided in this legislation and needs to have them now, without further delay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government needs wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this kind to deal with the sorts of activities engaged in by people who are determined to disrupt public services and to inconvenience the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because of that situation that the wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> and definitions of ‘industrial action’ are necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It refers to a wide variety of industrial practices and actions, which give rise to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which exist at the moment and which have been referred to, whereby the Public Service Board can apply to the Public Service Arbitrator for action, even leading to stand-downs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that it is necessary for the Government to have <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the kind contemplated in this definition contained in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He comes in here today and argues exactly the opposite case and says that the Executive needs these <span class="highlight">powers</span> and therefore the Parliament must give the Executive these <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government is prepared to enact legislation which will give it quite arbitrary <span class="highlight">powers</span> over its employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This shows the cynical abuse and cynical exploitation of the workers which takes place through people who do not respect the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and rights which they have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Trade Practices Amendment Bill, which was steamrollered through the Parliament during the last session- in a way similar to the way in which this legislation is being forced through in an abbreviated time- also provided new and wide-reaching <span class="highlight">powers</span> for governments or corporations to act against people who take industrial action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Bill aims to give the Government <span class="highlight">powers</span> to prevent such action by its own employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Therefore it would be contrary to the general thrust of the legislation- the need for more effective <span class="highlight">powers</span> than can now be exercised in situations of industrial action- were a bill to be contemplated in respect of the actual suspension and termination itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Have discussions been held between the Prime Minister and the Chief Secretary of the Northern Territory concerning the further transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Legislative Assembly for the Northern Territory; if so, what areas of responsibility are to be transferred in the second stage, and what is the proposed timetable for the transfer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770906_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to consider that in the wool industry, which has traditionally been a major part of what might be termed the free enterprise system, this Government is prepared to recognise that a central authority such as the Australian Wool Corporation should in fact be given additional <span class="highlight">powers</span> to ensure that the producer, the community at large, and particularly our export earners, are given every possible advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seeks to give the Australian Wool Corporation the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are to be <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation in respect of freighting its product. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I choose to say very little on the matter of freight, except that it is important that the Government recognise that the Wool Corporation should have maximum <span class="highlight">powers</span> in establishing control over the freighting arrangements for wool because there are few areas in which real cost savings can be made in the wool industry, or in fact in almost any primary industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee believes that the operations of government-owned public companies should be accessible to parliamentary scrutiny, irrespective of any annual public funding, and accordingly suggests that the terms of reference be altered clearly to include accountability provisions and to give the Committee appropriate <span class="highlight">powers</span> in that respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since our essential interest is the maintenance of an equilibrium between the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the region we will have to be sure of our own weight- which although not large could in some situations be important- is not used to endanger the equilibrium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever honourable senators may say about these schemes and about trade union consultations, it is a fact that during its term of office the Whitlam Government sought <span class="highlight">powers</span> on incomes and prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is terribly important that we in this Parliament should not allow to go unanswered the attempt to allege that something is not properly being done about the allegations in Victoria The Government of that State has taken the one proper course available to it, that of appointing a board of inquiry with all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> necessary to investigate these matters and therefore to determine whether there are inefficiencies or other problems associated with land dealings over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is for this reason, to distract attention from the real suffering of the people of Victoria and the need for this Australian Government and the Victorian Government to use together all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> available to them to determine that the rule of law shall prevail in Victoria, that people shall be entitled in that State to use the essential services which they need, that this motion has been moved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Pending the detailed consideration of the Act referred to later in this statement, the Industrial Relations Bureau will have the same <span class="highlight">powers</span> as the Arbitration Inspectorate, no more, no less, and those <span class="highlight">powers</span> will be exercised according to the same processes as they have been until now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Arbitration Inspectorate has always had this function; the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Bureau in relation to these matters will, however, be spelled out quite specifically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">powers</span> will include the power to notify the Commission of a breach or likely breach of a bans clause in an award and to make application for a certificate under section 33 of the Act to enable proceedings to be taken for breach of the award in the Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This would not perhaps emerge from some of the more recent statements by representatives of the Soviet Government and  Mr Gromyko  himself, but certainly there was no dispute between the great <span class="highlight">powers</span> on this issue at the time of the establishment of Isreal Since that time there have been- I do not want to deal with matters which I think all honourable senators are familiar with- several major conflicts between Isreal and the surrounding countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The next detailed point in the Bill to which I want to refer is the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of investigation of the Industrial Relations Burea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The next step in this legislation which is a remarkable advance is that where cancellation proceedings are before the court, the court can have incidental <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill, in the few aspects that I have chosen to emphasise, illustrates that it is a step forward in providing the court with those particular <span class="highlight">powers</span> which hitherto it did not have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest therefore that the one particular part of the Bill to which I have confined myself For the sake of clarity and brevity illustrates what  Senator Button  has failed to perceive, namely, that the Bill puts <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the hands of the court of great practical utility and effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators opposite are prepared to be objective about this, they will realise as well as I do that there was no way in the world that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of that emergency legislation which was subsequently introduced could have been applied to the air traffic controllers strike for the simple reason that nobody in this country has the skills required to control air traffic at civilian airports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In other words, notwithstanding the fact that the Victorian Government has revived the 1948 Essential Services Act with all its <span class="highlight">powers</span> that go far beyond any other piece of legislation bar probably the Atomic Energy Act 1953-1973, and notwithstanding the repressive, excessive <span class="highlight">powers</span> contained in the Essential Services Act, other workers in the Latrobe Valley are prepared to say that if certain things happen they will join the SEC maintenance workers in the Latrobe Valley. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Furthermore, the creation of the Bureau will ensure that there are additional <span class="highlight">powers</span> to secure the observance of the Act for and on behalf of individual unionists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those regulations and <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be properly exercised obviously need support at all levels because individual members would find it extremely difficult to undertake all legal obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is necessary also that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission itself should have additional <span class="highlight">powers</span> in today’s industrial climate to ensure that demarcation disputes are properly dealt with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In May of this year the establishment of the Industrial Relations Bureau with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Inspectorate was accepted by the Australian Council of Trade Unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It looked at seas and submerged lands legislation in the broadest federalist terms, in the knowledge that, as  Senator Wright  would know, the High Court had defined the <span class="highlight">powers</span> as lying within the Commonwealth, and the conference made a number of decisions, which have now been made public, which were welcomed by the States, in terms of co-operative federalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No, not Malcolm Fraser in 1977 but Stanley Melbourne Bruce in May 1928, when he was introducing a Bill that increased Federal <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the conciliation and arbitration system and imposed tougher controls on the unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, provisions dealing with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Industrial Relations Bureau were incorporated in legislation which was introduced in the Parliament in May this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is perfectly clear now to most people in the community, if not to  Mr Bob  Hawke and to the Opposition, that the legislation was most necessary and desirable and that the Industrial Relations Bureau, with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> it now has, will contribute substantially to the improvement of industrial relations in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although there is an appeal to the courts against decisions cif the Registrar, and the Registrar may not deal with disputes which are before the courts, the Committee considers that these provisions are in principle objectionable, in that they confer on an administrative official the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and responsibilities of a court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>“The Committee cannot conclude their Report without reminding the House, that, if henceforth, which they will not believe to be possible, no tax, hurtful to trade,’ and grievous to the People, can be remitted unless the Lords be pleased to remit it, or can be even recommended by the Crown to be considered by the Commons with a view to its remission, with that full assurance which has heretofore existed that such a tax will be remitted; not only will the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the House of Commons be impaired, but the foundation of the ancient freedom of England will be undermined; for where shall that ancient freedom be found when the right to determine the mode and the sum of taxation is divorced from the Representative Branch of the Legislature”. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After lengthy and acrimonious debate, the Resolution was passed by a large majority, and was followed by legislation embodying it, which finally clearly curtailed the financial <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the House of Lords. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If it is disagreed to by the government of the day we shall engage in conference and compromise, according to sensible people, because I need not remind all honourable senators that in the American Senate once a money Bill comes onto its floor the Senate has <span class="highlight">powers</span> equal to those of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well as reconsidering the role of the Senate we must look at the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Governor-General whose decision on the operations of the Senate can be superior even to that of both Houses of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That provisions relating to membership, <span class="highlight">powers</span> and proceedings of the Committee be contained in a subsequent resolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This requires legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> to collect statistics to replace those <span class="highlight">powers</span> currently contained in the Stevedoring Industry Act 1956. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A careful reading of the Stevedoring Industry Act 1956 will reveal that there are few limitations on the Authority’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> to obtain or disclose information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government considers that such wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> are not appropriate under the new arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, much of the Bill is concerned with defining the limits of <span class="highlight">powers</span> which had been left undefined in the existing arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In essence, the Bill seeks to transfer statistics collection <span class="highlight">powers</span> from the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority to the Department of Transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time the opportunity is being taken to introduce appropriate constraints on the use of these <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last Friday in a display of grandstanding he telexed all the State Premiers asking them to use their <span class="highlight">powers</span> in respect of the auction laws to eliminate collusive buying in cattle saleyards which apparently  Mr Fraser  believes is occurring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if the Government had any genuine interest in the position of primary producers and if it believed that there was collusion in saleyards and that monopolistic practices were depressing prices received by producers, why did it not give the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation full trading <span class="highlight">powers</span> in its own right? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At no time did I wish to convey the impression, as has been inferred from my remarks, that I was opposed to the Senate having <span class="highlight">powers</span> to reject a money Bill or to request an amendment to a money Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The book represents an interesting extrapolation of the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the Governor-General enjoys, and will I hope draw some critical attention to the sort of function which he performs, or ought to performwhich, of course, is a more important matter than is his salary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that it proves is that there is an ongoing political debate in which some legal people are involved as to the actual exercise of certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are apparently, under the Constitution, available to the Governor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are accustomed in debates in this place on the <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the Constitution, and the actions of the Governor-General whoever he or she may be, in the exercise of that power, but it is another thing to suggest as  Senator McLaren  has suggested, that the Governor-General has not done his duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third thing I want to say is that I protest against the use of these taxing <span class="highlight">powers</span> for the purpose of maintaining these operations which are supposed to be on an ordinary employer and employee basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the financial <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Parliament are abdicated by the refusal of the constituents of the Parliament to know and understand what is happening, the Parliament becomes reduced to an enigma and a cypher in the constitutional functions of government and the power of the Executive becomes overwhelming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apart from being repugnant to our philosophy as a Government, such an approach would be beyond our <span class="highlight">powers</span>, and almost certainly could not be made to work effectively in any case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite what the Minister for Social Security may say in this House in answer to questions, it amounts to the Government having discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The grant of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> to a separate independent statutory authority will substantially reduce the possibility of political involvement in the licensing process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation provides for a mock transferral of power from the Minister to the Broadcasting Tribunal in respect of the granting and renewal of broadcasting licenses because the power which is being given to the Tribunal by the legislation is, of course, tremendously limited by the <span class="highlight">powers</span> given to the Minister- for the first time quite explicitly in this regard- to call for applications for broadcasting licences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a recipe for corruption, which is the objectionable feature and which historically has been the objectionable feature of having licensing <span class="highlight">powers</span> residing in the hands of a politician. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have this absurd charade of repeated statements of that kind and at the same time he is granting himself, by this legislation, these quite enormous <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to the broadcasting structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a situation which is of concern and which this legislation does nothing to rectify because the Minister will still have those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for that reason that the Opposition is very concerned about the increased licensing <span class="highlight">powers</span> given to the Minister, the abuse of which has been discussed in the Press and is the common parlance of people concerned with broadcasting in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were very pleased when it appeared that there would be a restructuring which would divest the Minister of his <span class="highlight">powers</span> to control the media and would set up a tribunal which would be an objective, expert body, accessible to the public and so forth, whose main function would be the regulation of licences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister’s claim that the present ministerial <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the licensing area are transferred to the Tribunal by the Bill is simply not true. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As these ministerial specifications determine the scope of the Tribunal’s inquiries, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> given to the Minister by thus Bill are clearly greater than those transferred to the Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>S <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the area of licensing are to be transerred to the Tribunal by this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That has been tailored to the Minister’s specification for laying down such conditions of a licence as it sees fit on matters not covered by the Minister’s <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister, the Tribunal’s conditions will be substantially confined to programming and advertising standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Substantial <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the licensing area are retained in the hands of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was critical of it and suggested that this Government would not misuse the <span class="highlight">powers</span> but another government might. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These specifications will become, upon grant of the licence, conditions of the licence, an addition to the conditions set by the Tribunal pursuant to its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The transfer of the present ministerial <span class="highlight">powers</span> relating to the licensing of stations; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He went on to speak of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are given to the Tribunal under the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further matter on which a considerable amount of criticism has been made today is the allegation that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister under this Bill or the <span class="highlight">powers</span> from the original Act which are left with the Minister are too great. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a general reservation not only about this provision but also about many provisions which l eave too many decision-making <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to refer to some of them in relation to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> granted to the Minister in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill retains substantial <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the licensing area in the hands of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">powers</span> would enable a Minister, without any kind of public consultation, to determine the kind of programming that is to be available throughout the entire commercial and public broadcasting system and in each part of that system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our concern, therefore, is not that the Bill gives the Minister more power over licensing than he had before but that it retains this power in his hands within a completely new structure of planning that creates unprecedented dangers for distortion of the broadcasting system in the exercise of these ministerial <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They state that <span class="highlight">powers</span> are being granted which may be used by different governments and which may be used negligently or intentionally to the harm of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that in the review which is to take place and in the submissions to be looked at that matter should be considered carefully to determine whether there are <span class="highlight">powers</span> that might be changed so that the unprecedented dangers which are referred to will not occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Robertson  criticised- I think I would be somewhat with him on this point- the way in which the <span class="highlight">powers</span> are expressed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I wonder whether there ought not be a review of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> so that the same situation applies in respect to radio and television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that further consideration ought to be given to those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The effect of the Bill is not, as  Senator Button  has alleged, a mock transference of <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All of the Minister’s present licensing <span class="highlight">powers</span> are transferred to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Button  referred to the planning <span class="highlight">powers</span>, which remain with the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Button has criticised the proposed <span class="highlight">powers</span> concerning the imposition of licensing conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The amending Bill leaves the Minister with the same <span class="highlight">powers</span>, except that he is limited to conditions relating to certain specificationsfor example as to the nature, the area and the purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A new section 16a will be inserted to enable the Commission to carry out the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions relating to intrastate trading conferred by a State government, such as Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In most cases it is the States that have the legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> to monitor and enforce environmental standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gives the Tribunal the <span class="highlight">powers</span> it had under the old section 16 of the Act and it clarifies some very doubtful legal relationships between sections 16 and 18 of the present broadcasting legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter for comment that the Tribunal is given quite draconian <span class="highlight">powers</span> in terms of penalties for witnesses who fail to attend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Theoretically, the matter can be ut this high: If the Minister who is in charge of a Special Broadcasting Service prescribes m the exercise of the very wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> he is given that the Special Broadcasting Service shall provide current affairs and news programs- he is not answerable to the Parliament immediately and not answerable to the public in any way- the Australian Broadcasting Commission must have regard to that decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is another example of <span class="highlight">powers</span> being very firmly in the Minister’s hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that basically the <span class="highlight">powers</span> are sensible and fairly normal for the operations of the Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think no comment was made on those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the beauties of the Senate and one of the things which makes me say ‘Thank God for the founding fathers’ is that they had the courage, foresight and fortitude to insist on the creation of a system in which the Senate had equal representation from all the States and virtually equal <span class="highlight">powers</span> with the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reason for the conferences now being held is that the treaty <span class="highlight">powers</span> disagree on whether exploitation on the land or the seabed is compatible with the treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its presence in the Constitution does not cut down the reserve <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Governor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a matter on which my own mind is quite clear and I am acting in accordance with my own clear view of the principles laid down by the Constitution and of the nature, <span class="highlight">powers</span> and responsibility of my office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator McAuliffe, at this time of the evening and at this stage of the debate I have no desire to use the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which I have, and I warn you that if you interject again I shall have recourse to sterner measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The existing Act vests various <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the Senior Naval Officer’ which is defined as including ‘the senior naval officer doing duty at any naval waters’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since then it has become apparent that certain other provisions concerning loans and taxation may also be beyond the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of an ordinance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The authorities set out in the Schedule are limited to those established since 1973, when legal doubts about the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of an ordinance arose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think there has been a major problem- if there has been it has not been drawn to my attention- of Australians volunteering for the armies of foreign <span class="highlight">powers</span> and taking part in the invasions of other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In essence, what he is saying, without actually saying it, is that under the foreign <span class="highlight">powers</span> placitum of section 5 1 of the Constitution, simply because the Executive Government of the day has accepted or subscribed to a convention, an agreement, a consensus or an opinion of the Security Council of the United Nations, for example, calling upon Australia to provide armed forces for certain objects which the United Nations might have in view, the Minister of the day could enable that force to be raised in Australia without acknowledgement by or the understanding of Parliament, except in the context of financial <span class="highlight">powers</span> which might exist in the Parliament and temporarily reside in the Senate, because it would not be an ordinary annual service of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the de facto, one man government which we now regrettably have, we fear that the new <span class="highlight">powers</span> may be misappropriated by the Prime Minister to intimidate or even emasculate the IAC and to effectively silence the institution best equipped to do the economic research which will question and sometimes discredit the economic policies of the Prime Minister who is not noted for his tolerance of informed criticism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that it will not speak up now; I suggest that it will not speak up later; that it will not act in any way to curb the arbitrary <span class="highlight">powers</span> of, or the arbitrary misuse of power by, the Prime Minister in the future as in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was decided at that time on the recommendation of  Sir John  Crawford, after he had had discussions with the multifarious departments and organisations I have named in general, that the Industries Assistance Commission should be regarded as a completely independent statutory authority, given very wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> of an investigatory nature in order to enable it to make recommendations to the Government on the type of assistance that should be given to industries, providing a review of tariff policies that had remained unchanged for six years before the Whitlam Labor Government came to office and accumulating a rich source of data on the types of assistance that should be given to industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>By this clause the responsible Minister is given very wide and general <span class="highlight">powers</span> to specify any additional guidelines and to direct the Commission as to what priority is to be given to each of the guidelines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> that clause 8 seeks to allow any present or future government Minister are so broadly denned as to have the effect of emasculating the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and independence of the Commission and to politicise the whole operation of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Walsh  seemed to think that this legislation contained some hidden vice which gave the Prime Minister absolute statutory <span class="highlight">powers</span> to impose his will upon the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He sees in these amendments some hidden trap designed to give the Government arbitrary <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The third point to notice- although it is not mentioned in the part of the letter that I read out- is that the Commissioner of Taxation has no discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Queensland Government proceeds with its plan to take overthe administration of Aurukun and Mornington Island against the wishes of the Aboriginal people in those areas, will the Government be willing to use the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Parliament under section 5 1 of the Constitution to pass special laws to protect the people in those areas from the efforts of the Queensland Government, and will it be willing to tell the Queensland Government of its willingness to do so? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Virtually living dangerously, from a legal point of view- and there is an interesting analogy here- he used the defence <span class="highlight">powers</span> although it was debatable whether they still applied, since the war had ended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Surely, if the New South Wales Legislative Council is to virtually hobble the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the New South Wales Water Board, the custodian of catchments, the Federal Government has a role and can say, ‘Water is more important than coal’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said there was flooding, erosion, salinity and pollution and legislation would have to be introduced to alter the Commission ‘s <span class="highlight">powers</span> and structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This would not mean that the States would automatically lose their existing <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the letter he made it quite clear that in any areas where there were joint <span class="highlight">powers</span> between the Commonwealth and Queensland, the Commonwealth will should prevail in a matter on which the Australian people had expressed their views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> were given to your government by the people of Australia and the taking over of these reserves will be against the wishes of the Aboriginal people of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are asking the Government to use this Parliament’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> to protect these rights- <span class="highlight">powers</span> given to it in the Constitution; <span class="highlight">powers</span> that even a Statesrighter such as  Senator Chaney  admits are there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am much concerned about the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which we are giving to the Executive and taking away from Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of honourable senators, including  Senator Cavanagh,  raised the question of the general <span class="highlight">powers</span> within this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Since then it has become apparent that certain other provisions concerning loans and taxation may also be beyond the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of an ordinance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are opposed to it happening at the present time because of the complete chaos in which the Australian Capital Territory finds itself with regard to financial arrangements, the devolution of <span class="highlight">powers</span> from the Federal Parliament to the Legislative Assembly, and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Mr Staley  was Minister for the Capital Territory, after about 1 8 months in the portfolio he finally came up with a rather lengthy draft of proposals for devolution of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to a locally elected body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not good enough to go on procrastinating, saying that the position is very difficult and that the Government does not know which <span class="highlight">powers</span> it wants to devolve on the Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not good enough on the one hand to procrastinate about the devolution of <span class="highlight">powers</span>, to use that period of procrastination and confusion to continue to levy more and more charges on the people of the Australian Capital Territory, to give them no voice in the disbursement of the money so raised and then to say as soon as the Canberra Commercial Development Authority is established the Government will tax it because, after all, that was the principle laid down in 1 974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is serious about accepting its responsibilities in the Australian Capital Territory it will accept our amendment to postpone its consideration of this Bill for the time being and proceed to make the very serious and urgent decisions which it should make with regard to the devolution of <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the establishment of proper financial procedures to safeguard the future of the nation’s capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last 1 8 months we have reached a critical stage in the negotiations, to the point where the Territory has begun to enjoy a transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> leading to what is called responsible selfgovernment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of those <span class="highlight">powers</span>, I believe some 34 in number, were transferred on 1 January, but a large number are yet to be transferred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are discussing now is responsible self-government, with the Federal Government retaining, under the Northern Territory Administration Act, certain <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat, on 1 July most of the State-like responsibilities will be transferred, but certain other <span class="highlight">powers</span> will not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One cannot rush into the transference of such <span class="highlight">powers</span> as govern health and education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span>, this could possibly rise to five cents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among other things that describes the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in this area that these rather arbitrary <span class="highlight">powers</span> are being given to an individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those liberties are more likely to be preserved if there is parliamentary oversight of the persons being prescribed, rather than would be the case under the term that is so often used- of authorised persons or persons authorised by the Minister- or one to whom the Minister may delegate certain <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is what we have done and it is why I believe that the Presiding Officers, who apparently have these <span class="highlight">powers</span>- I am not certain from where they derive- have instituted a decision and progressed along that path without reference to the two Houses of Parliament and without any consideration being given to the views which might have been expressed in the debate which is now taking place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Irrespective of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the Presiding Officers have, surely they should consider that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> flow from the House and from the Senate and that they are responsible back to those two Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot has been said in this debate about the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and rights of Presiding Officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am one of those who believe that the Presiding Officers are only the servants of the chambers over which they preside and whereas by long-standing custom certain matters are delegated to the Presiding Officers, they are delegated basically on a day-to-day basis and do not become entrenched as <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Presiding Officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Occasionally there is a tendency for people to believe that certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> have become entrenched and that the chambers have lost those <span class="highlight">powers</span> because the Presiding Officers have had them for so long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In so far as the action referred to in the question can only be taken if the Commonwealth acquires additional family law <span class="highlight">powers</span>, it must await the outcome of the initiatives that has been taken in the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General referred to in ( 1 ) above. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, is it true that the draft contains no technical definition of safety standards or procedures and gives the Minister extensive reserve <span class="highlight">powers</span> over individual and collective civil rights? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that very few of the major European, Asian and Pacific <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the United Nations, as the Foreign Minister has said, opposed the Indonesian action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This resolution was adopted unanimously by the United Nations organisation, which included the major <span class="highlight">powers</span>, and in my view indicted for all time the action taken by Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within a matter of days following that unfortunate incident, the United Nations was able to move because the Arab states and the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> were able to bring sufficient pressure to bear upon the Israeli Government to permit the withdrawal of troops and their substitution by United Nations forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a long way from the major <span class="highlight">powers</span>, so they are not interested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time the Opposition expressed, and I express again on its behalf, its serious reservations about the vesting in the Minister of these extensive <span class="highlight">powers</span> in respect of the planning and development of broadcasting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, we agree that there must be co-ordinated planning of broadcasting but we have reservations about entrusting those <span class="highlight">powers</span> directly to the Minister as the amendment to the Broadcasting and Television Act in December did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Bill stipulates in detail the functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the College and provides for a Council to govern the College and to administer its affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the registration of the people who will be appointed by the Minister to administer the <span class="highlight">powers</span> authorised in the Bill, one sees that any person who is refused registration by the Minister as an administrator will have the right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth is not enlarging its own <span class="highlight">powers</span>; it is not in any sense taking over the reserves itself, but is only allowing the communities themselves to exercise local responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs may declare that the legislation applies to a reserve or community on request by a council established under the Queensland law or if he is satisfied that a substantial majority of the adults resident on the reserve or community wish it; an existing council established under Queensland law or a body declared to be a council for the purposes of the Act, will have the function of managing community affairs and the necessary <span class="highlight">powers</span> to carry out that function; any declared body established under the regulations will be an elected council or otherwise a properly incorporated body; councils will have power to make by-laws and to authorise entry to reserves; by express provision, councils and individual Aboriginals and Islanders will not be bound to obey directions given by officials under the Queensland legislation; councils will be responsible only to their communities; the Commonwealth may, if it becomes necessary in order to give effect to the purposes of the legislation, make available to councils land acquired by or otherwise vested in the Commonwealth; and in the case of acquisition, the provisions of the Lands Acquisition Act will apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Several of the key legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred by the Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders Act are racist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The current Bill will provide Aborigines in Queensland with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of exclusion in relation to who enters their reserves, but it fails fundamentally- and this is one of our points of contention- in that it does not provide them with the power to exclude individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But when  Senator Keeffe  can predict some three years in advance what is going to happen one starts to think that he is not relating fairy tales, and one begins to wonder whether he has clairvoyant <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Bill  Hayden, and the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs,  Dr Doug  Everingham, called for urgent and early legislation, and if necessary, for the Parliament to meet before 1 April so that urgent legislation could be drawn up and passed, under the <span class="highlight">powers</span> provided in the Constitution by the 1967 referendum, to try to prevent this precipitate, unpopular and unjust action of the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wright also criticised the ambit of the Bill and said that it gave the councils great <span class="highlight">powers</span> comparable with the scope of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of Federal and State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>there is in existence for a Reserve to which this Act applies … a Council of that kind, but the Minister is of the opinion that he should exercise his <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this section to declare another body to be the Council for the Reserve … the Minister may, by notice published in the  Gazette,  declare a body . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The National Aboriginal Consultative Committee, which was an Aboriginal elected body and which was truly representative of the Aboriginal people, now is only an Aboriginal council which has no greater <span class="highlight">powers</span> than to appoint five members to a body to which the Minister also appoints five members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-With the concurrence of the Committee, I propose to deal with the four circulated amendments to clause 5 because they all deal with a common principle which we want to establish and which I submit, on the basis of the point that has been raised by  Senator Wright  in the previous discussion, would at least to some extent restrict the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe, if there is to be any genuine act of self-determination, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the council which has been elected or appointed under this legislation must extend over all of the reserve land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The clause does not give <span class="highlight">powers</span> with respect to housing, health, education, sewerage and so on but does give authority in regard to the provision of the services that I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to a report in the Melbourne  Sun  on 10 April of the weekend meeting between Commonwealth and State AttorneysGeneral and in particular to the statement that all State governments except those of Queensland and Western Australia are prepared to transfer family law <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Commonwealth to enable the same laws and facilities to apply to the custody and welfare of ex-nuptial children and to all matrimonial property in order to overcome the effects of High Court judgments in 1976 which limited the effectiveness of the Family Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is there a constitutional or any other reason why the majority of States cannot transfer such <span class="highlight">powers</span> despite the obstruction of the Queensland Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst there is a need in some areas for ministerial discretion and ministerial direction within his discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span>, there are areas in which such things should not be left to the Minister alone or to the Executive alone, but which should be left to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Gietzelt  raises the whole question of appropriate <span class="highlight">powers</span> for the regulation of corporations and the securities industry, and that matter is one to which the Government has given very close attention throughout the time it has been in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Senate has before it a Bill which allows an extension of the borrowing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation to enable the Corporation to borrow, with provision for the Commonwealth to guarantee repayment, moneys for the purpose of promoting the sale and consumption of apples and pears and apple and pear products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Apple and Pear Corporation was formed in 1 974 and replaced the Apple and Pear Board which was a body with more restricted <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was considered at the time- I think generally agreed by the industry and most people involved in it- that a body with wider <span class="highlight">powers</span>, particularly in the marketing area, would be to the advantage of the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that it will be of advantage to the Corporation to have these additional <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We trust that with these <span class="highlight">powers</span> the Corporation will be able to continue its work of strengthening generally the marketing position for apples and pears in this country and overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new <span class="highlight">powers</span> which will be vested in the Corporation to give it the necessary ability to cope adequately with the marketing problems are set out in clause 4 of the Bill, which will empower the Corporation to borrow moneys for the purpose of: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill will adequately arm the Corporation with the necessary <span class="highlight">powers</span> to promote the sale of the products without waiting for funds to come in from the levies which are imposed on sales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am confident that the extension of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Corporation effected by this Bill will be in the best interests of the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I reiterate, as was noted in the second reading speech, that the purpose of the Bill is to extend borrowing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Corporation and enable it to borrow with provision for the Commonwealth to guarantee repayment of moneys for the purpose of promoting the sale and consumption of apples and pears and apple and pear products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has already stated publicly that if the proposed legislation and the lease arrangements which will be legislated for by the Queensland Government are not satisfactory to the Commonwealth, the Commonweatlh will use its constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> of acquisition in order to ensure that the rights and interests of the people of the two communities are fully protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I state again for the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs that if the agreement which was reached yesterday does not produce legislation which is acceptable to the Commonwealth after consultation with the two communities, the Commonwealth will then use its <span class="highlight">powers</span> of acquisition to ensure that the rights and interests of the people are fully protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There will be no reduction in the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth will maintain those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suppose it would be necessary to explain to  Senator Gietzelt  what <span class="highlight">powers</span> have been handed back to the States because, in his cocoon of centralist socialism, he would be blind to anything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He could not have escaped the fact that in regard to perhaps the most significant of all <span class="highlight">powers</span>- that is, the seas and submerged lands <span class="highlight">powers</span>- the Commonwealth, of its own initiative, through the Premiers Conference, has invited the States to share <span class="highlight">powers</span> with the Commonwealth although the High Court ruled that <span class="highlight">powers</span> lay with the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose this debate is about philosophies because we on this side of the chamber propound the policy of division of <span class="highlight">powers</span>, the right of the States and local government to receive their legitimate share of the tax revenues of the Commonwealth and to spend it without direction by the Commonwealth on items which they think are of greatest priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is most important that we look at that and, while doing so, look also at the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commissioner of the Northern Territory Public Service because he would appear to have more power than other public service commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has decided to proceed with legislation to free Aboriginals on Queensland reserves from the provisions of the Queensland Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders Acts which give State officials overriding <span class="highlight">powers</span> over the management of communities on Aboriginal and Islander reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government considers the provisions of the Queensland legislation are discriminatory and outdated, primarily because they give Government officials extraordinary <span class="highlight">powers</span> to manage and direct the lives of Aboriginals and Islanders on reserves, trusteeship of reserves and the right to negotiate on behalf of Aboriginals and Islanders about land use, in particular exploration and mining on reserves; power to manage the property of Aboriginals and Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the event of any State Government being unwilling or unable to adequately guarantee the rights of the Aboriginal and Islander peoples to self-determination, the Australian Government should not hesitate to use its constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the manner and to the extent desired by those peoples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The extraordinary <span class="highlight">powers</span> given to the Queensland Government under the new legislation will do a number of things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But why should we expect the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the Queensland Government will retain under the proposed legislation to be exercised any less discriminatorily than the <span class="highlight">powers</span> it has under the Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders Act are exercised? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They do not want control by that Government and they do not want the legislation because it gives extraordinary <span class="highlight">powers</span> to Queensland officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  said that the Government would not flinch from using its <span class="highlight">powers</span> to acquire land if necessary to protect the position of the people of Aurukun and Mornington Island, but their interests would best be served by cooperation with the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why does the Government not use its <span class="highlight">powers</span> to acquire the land? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of Australia showed how they felt about Aboriginal people when we held the referendum on <span class="highlight">powers</span> to legislate for Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has that behind it and it should take the opportunity to go forth and use those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this squabble the Federal Government must now use the <span class="highlight">powers</span> it has to acquire the land and give these people back their humanity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to that and many other matters, the legislation confers <span class="highlight">powers</span> upon the Queensland Government to remove the shire clerk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It confers <span class="highlight">powers</span> upon the Queensland Minister to decide who shall have the right of entry or exclusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that the legislation, together with the other Bills with which we will be dealing shortly, provides very extensive <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Aborigines concerned, not only in relation to access to information but also in relation to the enforcement of standards which are imposed upon mining companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has tacked this commercial purpose or objective on to the principal Act, that is the Atomic Energy Act of 1953, which incorporates all the sweeping defence <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the Commonwealth can assert for itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">powers</span> were held to be legally valid- we are not concerned with that here- they would override completely all existing rights and titles which have been acquired by persons or companies under State or Territory laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What  Senator Durack  really appears to have been objecting to there was not the use of regulations but the sweeping <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the principal Act conferred upon the relevant Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least that would give the Government some sort of <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to uranium which, apparently, the Government would not have over minerals generally throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He seemed to be objecting in that instance to the fact that the regulations and the principal Act gave the Government <span class="highlight">powers</span> over uranium which it did not have over minerals generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the 1953 Act-  - and the wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> given under it were, of course, at that time dictated very much by the strategic character of uranium as to its use in the production of atomic weapons and the great concern which was held at that time in respect of that subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, the Commonwealth Government has adequate <span class="highlight">powers</span> in regard to the national interest as far as mining, including the mining of uranium, is concerned under its export control <span class="highlight">powers</span> generally and under regulations that have been made under those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Twenty-one of the Liberal Party and National Country Party senators who in 1974 disallowed regulations made under the Atomic Energy Act of 1953 on the grounds inter alia that it was quite improper to use an Act which was primarily a defence Act, or associated with the defence <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth, for commercial purposes, presumably will all support a Bill which will do precisely that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>do all such things as are necessary or convenient for the effectual exercise of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> specified in the preceding paragraphs of this sub-section. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, it claims virtually unlimited <span class="highlight">powers</span> over property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the reasons I have stated with regard to the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill, it is quite clear that the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill should be rejected by the Senate, particularly in view of the fact that three and a half years ago Liberal and National Country Party senators rejected regulations made under the Act on the grounds that it was improper to use an Act rooted in the defence <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth for commercial purposes, and the regulations were disallowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the clause in detail one sees that it provides that if the Government decides that a situation exists as a result of nuclear activity a Minister is given extremely wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> to deal with that situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extent of those <span class="highlight">powers</span> will vary according to a totally undefined situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> could include <span class="highlight">powers</span> of search, seizure and detention, control of buildings, control of property and the movement of people, control of employment, censorship of the media and things like telephone tapping, to give some examples which might be hypothetical but which might be real. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must understand that the Parliament operates in a society in which there should be freedom of discussion and debate on these matters and that persons involved in that process of freedom of discussion and debate should not be subjected to the sort of pernicious <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are available to the Government under the Atomic Energy Act and which will be available to the Government if the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill is passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The object of this Act is to make provision, within the limits of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Parliament, for protecting the health and safety of the people of Australia, and the environment, from possible harmful effects associated with nuclear activities in Australia, and this Act and the regulations shall be construed and administered accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be subject to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister at all phases of its activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill overrides several <span class="highlight">powers</span> now exercised by the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 1 1 gives complete <span class="highlight">powers</span> of decision and regulation to the Executive and that is something not to be wished, and devoutly so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the continuation of the States holding <span class="highlight">powers</span> in this field is quite anachronistic, archaic and inappropriate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then reference is made to the Atomic Energy Act which, as you know, Madam Acting Deputy President, is based upon only two <span class="highlight">powers</span>, defence and territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That arrangement is a central element in the Government’s federalism policy which is aimed at restoring a proper distribution of <span class="highlight">powers</span> and responsibilities between the three spheres of governmentCommonwealth, State and local. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission are to be extended to include minerals found in association with uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also gives the Commonwealth Minister, by order of the Governor-General, wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> of action to control and eliminate hazards resulting from nuclear activity where existing laws are inadequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I tend to agree with  Senator Wright’s  view that the States should cede <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Commonwealth in relation to this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the amendment moved by the Opposition because, in our view, whether one accepts the view put by  Senator Wright  that the States should cede <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Commonwealth or whether one takes the view which I apprehend that Ministers of this Government take in pursuit of their new federalism policy, as an alternative to  Senator Wright’s  view, there should have been further consultation with the States about very important matters in this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that without these regulations the Commonwealth Government has already ample <span class="highlight">powers</span> to ensure the national interest in the exploration, conservation and orderly development of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the States and the Territories have supplementary <span class="highlight">powers</span>, and they can work in co-operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a Bill to take from our State governments all their existing <span class="highlight">powers</span> over the resources in their States, all their vital need to obtain their finances from royalties, all their responsibilities for developing these things in an orchestration of State development and to give all those <span class="highlight">powers</span> to a central government in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has the power to maintain Australia’s national interest through his control <span class="highlight">powers</span> in respect to export and other matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These extra <span class="highlight">powers</span> are apparently sought by the Minister Tor somewhat dubious purposes and they will have the effect of overriding all existing rights that have been acquired under the State laws and under the Northern Territory mining laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather than expanding on the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of Local Authorities created under the Act it would appear that their <span class="highlight">powers</span> are circumscribed and accordingly the ability of the Lessee to effect purposes under the demise are similarly circumscribed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under Section 30 the General <span class="highlight">Powers</span> are set out in some detail and certain other express <span class="highlight">powers</span> which normally are not considered to be basic Local Authority <span class="highlight">powers</span> are contained in Section 3 1 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our clients wish to draw to your attention the concern that under clause 22 the State Government will be able to appoint Officers of the Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs who will by virtue of Clause 23 be able to remain permanently on the lands without any control by the Local Authority- their fear is that this is a ‘back door’ way of the State Government still retaining control, indeed more so than it did prior to the 13th March and the Council  require  a clear statement from the State Government that it will not exercise its <span class="highlight">powers</span> under Clause 22 unless with the prior consent of the Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Council is concerned that your <span class="highlight">powers</span> under Clause 16 not powerful enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Considered that <span class="highlight">powers</span> of entry under 23 sufficient without this express power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are talking about Aborigines of the Aurukun and Mornington Island communities at present, we ought to say that despite the fact that much rhetoric may have been heard from the Opposition about Queensland, it did not have the courage or the capacity to use its <span class="highlight">powers</span> to do anything about rights for Aborigines, particularly land rights, in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that these two communities are ready for self-management and, as I said in this place when we dealt with the legislation, we would consider acquisition of the land if this were the only way in which our own policy for Aborigines could be achieved consistent with our responsibilities under the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that were given to the Commonwealth by the Australian people at referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal people recall that in 1967 a referendum was held which gave certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Federal Government in respect of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are frightened of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> being sought for the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and of what might happen to them in this respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill has three main elements: The establishment, functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the CES; the position and responsibility of the National Director of the CES, and the status of the staff; and the establishment, functions and membership of a national advisory committee on the CES, and provision for the establishment of regional and local advisory committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is worth recalling the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that this Committee has and which I believe, as does  Senator Wright,  are not included in the disallowance of these codes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 1 3 of the Bill gives <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Governor-General to deal with special situations if he is satisfied that the health or safety of persons, or the environment, are likely to be harmed by a situation resulting from a nuclear activity that exists in a State or Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore face these two Bills of the package with some trepidation and some concern, determined that if they are passed, we in this Parliament must be extra vigilant as to how the <span class="highlight">powers</span> are used and how the Senate, in particular, stands up to the obligations which it has to review and consider regulations and other responsibilities of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They relate to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of university authorities and the associations that exist on campuses; they relate also to the meaning, I believe, in this case in particular, of conscientious objection; and to the significant issue of the fundamental freedoms of individuals to which I referred at the outset, such as the freedom of association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It proposes to ensure that the Treasurer will continue to have full responsibility for the reserve, and to that end provides specific investment <span class="highlight">powers</span> for the Treasurer and creates a separate corporation, consisting of the Treasurer and his successors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Bill includes some necessary saving’ and machinery provisions, including a power of delegation by the Treasurer in respect of his <span class="highlight">powers</span> under section 6- investment of the reserve- corresponding with the power to delegate already given to the Minister for Finance by section 70 A of the Audit Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is agreed that if it is in a national park area they should give it up but in view of the multitude of <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the director has and the controls by which the Aboriginals are compelled to abide, and which they do not understand, to my mind that is something criminal and should not be allowed to happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendments underline our recognition of the role of the Northern Territory in respect of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions of the Supervising Scientist which are to be established under the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In order to administer the vast jurisdiction to be exercised under the Act, the regulationmaking <span class="highlight">powers</span> have been expanded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the Council is invested with sufficiently wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> to enable it to execute its functions.Thirdly, provisions are made for the independence of the Council to enable it to undertake its functions effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To discharge its important functions, the Council is to be provided with appropriate <span class="highlight">powers</span>, listed in clauses 6 to 9 and 20 to 24 of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Council will also have <span class="highlight">powers</span> to engage consultants to conduct studies for it and to arrange with the Commonwealth authorities for officers of those authorities to be available to assist the Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">powers</span> should enable the Council to meet its responsibilities adequately, from the conduct of basic investigations and information gathering, using such expert advice and assistance as are necessary, to reporting its advice and recommendations directly to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another provision designed to secure the independence of the Council is clause 25 of the Bill, which exempts the Council and those working for it from legal action in relation to any act done in good faith and in accordance with ASTEC ‘s <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to achieve these objectives, the Parliament has enacted the Public Service Act in which are laid down the principles which govern the personnel policies of the Public Service, and has vested the principal responsibility for administering the Act in the Public Service Board which in turn delegates a number of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the management of departmental authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the Public Service there is a special need that it be the Parliament and the Board exercising the <span class="highlight">powers</span> vested in it by Parliament which determines principles and procedures governing recruitment, selection and promotion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 have the very strong suspicion that that Convention will not deal with important issues, such as the nature of Commonwealth industrial power, the nature of Commonwealth economic <span class="highlight">powers</span>, the nature of Commonwealth foreign affairs <span class="highlight">powers</span>, and matters of that kind which were dealt with in 1958, apparently as matters of importance then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Of course, if the Land Council does not consent to the lease, the arbitrator has power to intervene and there are <span class="highlight">powers</span> under section 7 of the Act for the Government by proclamation to take over the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>shall, from time to time, consult with, and have regard to the views of, the Administrator of the Northern Territory in relation to the performance of functions and the exercise of <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this Act by officers or employees of the Territory or of an authority of the Territory; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>may make arrangements with the Administrator for the performance of those functions and the exercise of those <span class="highlight">powers</span> by such officers or employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Director may make arrangements with the Head of a Department of the Public Service of the Northern Territory, or with an authority of the Territory, for the performance of functions and the exercise of <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this Act by officers or employees of the Department or of the authority, as the case may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter becomes more important because it is not just a question of the Government of the Commonwealth consulting with the Administrator of the Northern Territory in relation to the performance of functions and the exercise of <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the Act by officers or employees of of the Territory or of any authority of the Territory, and making arrangements with the Administrator for the performance of those functions and the exercise of those <span class="highlight">powers</span> by such officers or employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the uranium issue was a matter of such concern that the States should cede their <span class="highlight">powers</span> in that regard to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the face of widespread concern both in Australia and in the world, the Government has, on this fundamental issue of the importance of safety codes in the development of uranium mining, backed away- in the pursuit of some peculiar notion of its own, derived perhaps from Montesquieu and Adam Smith about the nature of the separation of <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the desirability of having regard to the views of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate the constitutional difficulties but surely the first approach to the States should be one of consultation first to see whether they will agree to give the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to this matter and secondly whether they agree to a uniform code. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government having demonstrated that it is consulting in full, we now find that the Opposition says that the Commonwealth should be acting within its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again the Opposition should look to its debating thrust of the past because it has been very much concerned with what it has taken to be the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Governor-General to intercede in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point to which I should like the Minister to respond is whether in those discussions between State officials- perhaps that was not an appropriate place for it to be done- any discussion was on the agenda or took place relating to the desirability of State power, of the States giving <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Commonwealth in relation to this matter of a code. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because there is some worry about where constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> lie in Australia we will do this as far as possible by complementary legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should also point out that the Commonwealth Government, quite apart from its consensus capacities, which were urged, has reserve <span class="highlight">powers</span> to persuade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I heard him correctly, he said that the Australian Government has other reserve <span class="highlight">powers</span> to persuade the States as to the types of codes of practice or the codes of practice they should request. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assume- if I am wrong, again I hope  Senator Carrick  will correct me- that one of those reserve <span class="highlight">powers</span> he had in mind was the power of the Commonwealth to grant or to withhold an export licence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he envisages a situation in which that Commonwealth power will be exercised to persuade- I think ‘coerce’ would be a more appropriate verb to use in the circumstancesa State into requesting the codes of practice which the Commonwealth wants, then I suggest that it would be much better if the legislation dealing with the codes of practice covered that situation instead of using the reserve <span class="highlight">powers</span>, or what  Senator Carrick  called the reserve <span class="highlight">powers</span>, of the Commonwealth over export trade, to discipline the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But apart from that, on the question of whether the codes of practice ought to be more clearly written into the Act which purports to establish codes of practice, at least while the present Government or a government of similar persuasion is in office, one must have serious doubts as to whether that Government in fact would use those reserve <span class="highlight">powers</span> over exports or whatever it was that  Senator Carrick  had in mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore we are confronted now not with the mixture that we had in the Bill dealing with regulation-making <span class="highlight">powers</span> implementing the code but a straight out unvarnished proposition contained in this amendment which seeks to substitute a new sub-clause ( 10) of the following terms: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not go as far as  Senator Wright  in this, but it seems that we have moved from a situation in which we were going to repose certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> into a situation, following objections by the States- I think many of their objections were sound- in which the States now have a veto. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More importantly, the Commonwealth itself has, beyond its consultative abilities, reserve <span class="highlight">powers</span> to act in a number of ways if necessary if it can be shown in this country that there is any need to act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask specifically: What reserve <span class="highlight">powers</span> does the Minister have in mind? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, some other <span class="highlight">powers</span> obviously would have to be used, as the Minister has said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the general width of the expressions in the clause, which I think are dangerously wide and may be protected only by the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Parliament to disallow regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat the concern I expressed on the second reading debate in relation to the width of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> and whether further consideration could be given to tidying up this clause and limiting the extent to which the Minister may make regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 50 of the Act provides for wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> of detention, search and arrest without warrant, which are extreme measures in relation to the development of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, these objections which I raise to sections of the Atomic Energy Act which will be used in relation to uranium mining at Ranger clearly illustrate the contradictory stand on civil liberties by the Government and the use of extreme <span class="highlight">powers</span>, which were employed in the Cold War period of the 1 940s, with respect to a commercial development in the late 1970’s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Government has made it clear and my instructions are quite clear that under no circumstances will the Government use coercive <span class="highlight">powers</span>, which in that Act are largely contained for defence purposes, for breaches of what might be an ordinary commercial undertaking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both countries have a high stake in the security and prosperity of other economically advanced democratic <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the world; in the continuation of the process of detente between the super-<span class="highlight">powers</span>; in maintaining an open and nondiscriminatory regime in international trade; in encouraging a continuing United States presence in the Asia/Pacific region to the extent necessary to maintain a sound balance of power there; in opposing any attempt by the Soviet Union- or any other major power- to establish hegemony in the Asia/Pacific region; and in encouraging China to continue to play a constructive role in regional affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has <span class="highlight">powers</span>, it has responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it has not always been given opportunity either to respond to or to exercise those <span class="highlight">powers</span> and responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, that <span class="highlight">powers</span> are not taken away from a State simply because some States have grown bigger and some States have not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it does mean that there is good reason to ensure that we do not just hand over entirely the total <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the governments of this country to the areas which have managed to featherbed their populations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time the State governments, acting under their constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>, have set up a series of committees to look at post-secondary education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the exercise of his <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations the Minister for Trade and Resources has a wide discretion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The things that have happened over the last few weeks- I propose to go into more detail shortly- indicate quite clearly that the Federal Government ought to use its legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> now to take over both of these settlements and to give full land rights to the people there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that the expression ordinary annual services of government’ is employed in section 53 of the Constitution to classify the expenditure in respect of which the Senate’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> of amendment are restricted to requesting the House of Representatives to make amendments and in section 54 to protect the Senate against the tacking of extraneous matters to an Appropriation Bill for the ordinary annual services of the Government, which, in accordance with section 53, the Senate may not amend but may request amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill completes the legislative framework of the tax sharing arrangements which are a central element of the Government’s federalism policy, a policy aimed at restoring a proper distribution of <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions between the Federal, State and local spheres of government, with governments more responsive to the needs and preferences of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that the Ombudsman has <span class="highlight">powers</span> of recommendation only, but the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, where it has the power to hear appeals, can actually reverse an administrative decision? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The allotment was made pursuant to a special resolution by which the company, in the exercise of <span class="highlight">powers</span> given by its articles, resolved that $205,325, forming part of the undivided profits of the company representing profits arising from the sale of assets not acquired for the purpose of resale at a profit and standing to the credit of the capital profits reserve account, be capitalised and distributed proportionately amongst the members on the footing that they became entitled thereto as capital, and that the capitalised sum be applied in paying up in full 205,325 of the unissued ordinary shares of one dollar each in the capital of the company and that the same be distributed amongst the members as fully paid ordinary shares of a dollar each in satisfaction of the capital sum and in proportion to the number of shares then held by them respectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In line with the transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> from the Commonwealth to the Northern Territory a smooth transition of responsibilities from the Commonwealth to the Northern Territory Ombudsman is most desirable and to this end the Bill contains appropriate transitional provisions to ensure, for example, the completion of investigations begun by the Commonwealth Ombudsman prior to the date of transition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since the Administrator’s <span class="highlight">powers</span>, as Administrator, flow from the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act, the Bill will exclude from review by the Federal Court all decisions made under the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do we recognise that a State has the right to extend or propose the establishment of a local government area or do we retain the notion, by virtue of the Commonwealth’s Aboriginal <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the Constitution, as amended in 1967, that the Commonwealth has a superior jurisdiction and that this amendment in the Bill is simply a direction to consult? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever might be the views of  Senator Georges  about the external affairs <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth and, indeed, whatever the ambit of those <span class="highlight">powers</span> might be in law, the policy of this Government is one of co-operation with the States and not one of riding roughshod over the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#debate-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Northern Territory suggested a staged devolution of <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other principles implied in the Bill suggest that the giving of decision-making <span class="highlight">powers</span> is what the Bill is all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, it would be true to say that with the Territory developing as it is, and with its responsible government status emerging- a government with plenary <span class="highlight">powers</span>- for the first time the Territory is being recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> from the Federal Government to the Northern Territory is a very complex situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this legislation a multitude of State-like <span class="highlight">powers</span> will be handed over to the Northern Territory as from 1 July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main <span class="highlight">powers</span> that will be transferred at a later time relate to health, which I understand will be handed over to the Northern Territory as from 1 January 1979, and education, which will be handed over from 1 July 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is felt that it would be much better if the new <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are not to be handed to the Northern Territory were spelt out by regulation by the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is a changing situation because of the transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other Bills relate to the transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span>, the Ombudsman Amendment Bill and the Remuneration Tribunals Amendment Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the present situation there is no necessity for further wastage of time in the transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Northern Territory by having an opinion poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a very odd situation in which this Bill gives the Legislative Assembly plenary legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> under clause 6; but under clause 35 proceeds to hand out executive power in dribs and drabs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have effectively done in clause 6 is to grant the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are in excess of those which are enjoyed by any State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Territory wants- State-type <span class="highlight">powers</span>- and have given it the widest possible legislative authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That legislative authority is restricted only by the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which remain to the Commonwealth under clause 7 or clause 9 to disallow laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One must bear in mind that clause 9, which empowers the Governor-General to disallow laws generally, is of the kind that was generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite wrong for the Commonwealth to legislate in terms which do not specifically restrict the Legislative Assembly to the exercise of State <span class="highlight">powers</span>; in other words, to give the Legislative Assembly power to impose duties on excise, for example, is to my mind an error and one that we could live to regret. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would ask the Government to give earnest consideration to making it clear that clause 6 is meant to give no more than State-type legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have considerable concern for the fear which is felt in the Northern Territory that the granting of a list of executive <span class="highlight">powers</span> will give rise to what might be termed demarcation disputes over precisely where executive <span class="highlight">powers</span> lie in any situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I now think that if we followed that course the Commonwealth would have to indicate what are all its <span class="highlight">powers</span> under section 6 1 of the Constitution and would have to be extremely careful to cover all areas of Federal authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, these are the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are to be transferred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 7 (2) (b)- the one we are referring to now- deals with all other <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let it be seen to have the control as a safeguard against the unwitting <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Administrator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation now of course is that following the transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> all lands will be transferred from the Commonwealth to the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has already authorised the Corporation to follow a number of aspects of the report, for example, the operation of the floor price arrangement, limited direct wool marketing by the Corporation and increased shipping <span class="highlight">powers</span> for the Corporation to ensure that its resources are available in the negotiation of favourable freight rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 6 of the Bill requires the responsible Minister of a department or authority to publish a statement setting out particulars of the organisation and functions of the department or authority, including an indication of any decisionmaking <span class="highlight">powers</span> and other <span class="highlight">powers</span> affecting members of the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government is confident that it has the constitutional power, through its taxing <span class="highlight">powers</span> and so on, to make this legislation operative or to achieve the purposes sought by this legislation, why did the Minister go on to talk about the Commonwealth having recourse to section 96 grants if any State really wanted to play it tough? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely the only answer to the problem is that the Parliament should use the <span class="highlight">powers</span> available to it under the Constitution, given to it by an overwhelming majority of the people of this country, to take over these areas, to look after the welfare of these people, to allow them to develop in their own way without the paternalistic nonsense which we know goes on in Queensland and to allow them to have a proper say in the future development of the mineral and other resources in their area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are concerned of course to see the Australian Government so indifferent when its citizens are being harassed by foreign <span class="highlight">powers</span> in Australia, imprisoned by a foreign power abroad and even executed by a foreign power abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a long time the nations of the South Pacific were taken for granted, partly because for a long period they were territories of metropolitan <span class="highlight">powers</span> beyond the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This can be partly explained because the metropolitan powersFrance, the United Kingdom and the United States of America in particular- were the dominant <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The metropolitan <span class="highlight">powers</span> began to move out as more and more countries- as I said, some only mini states- achieved independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are areas of dispute between the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and authority of the South Pacific Forum and the South Pacific Conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that many Great <span class="highlight">Powers</span> are interested in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This creates problems for these small States in determining how to handle such situations and not be exploited by the larger <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can never forget that these states more and more will become of interest to the Great <span class="highlight">Powers</span>; that by some they may be regarded as being of strategic interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Bill will correct that position, in situations coming within the Commonwealth ‘s consitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular it was agreed that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the States should be extended to the territorial sea including the seabed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The object of this exercise which we have been engaged in since last year has been to endeavour, on the basis of federalism, to restore to the States <span class="highlight">powers</span>, many of which were thrown in great doubt as a result of the High Court decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, there is obviously a need to reorder the position on offences at sea as soon as possible, and in that regard for this Parliament to deal with those cases that come under the Commonwealth’s constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is yet another reason why we should consider joining that enlightened group of nations, mostly small nations and middle <span class="highlight">powers</span> like ourselves, such as Switzerland, Holland and the Scandinavian nations, who have an active interest in better forms of democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are the establishment, functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth Employment Service; the position and responsibility of the National Director of the Commonwealth Employment Service, including the status of the staff of the Service; and the establishment, functions and membership of a national advisory committee on the CES and provision for the establishment of regional and local advisory committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A deputy ombudsman, if so designated, could exercise all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth Ombudsman in relation to official action taken in the relevant Territory, except the power to report to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that ‘ unless the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that be learned nothing from their experience of 1 977 and decide to intervene again to bring activity back to their own forecasts’, the outlook for the industry would not fulfil the optimistic long-term projections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Namibia, through an initiative inspired and carried through by the Western <span class="highlight">powers</span>, and sub: stantially assisted by the Presidents of the socalled front line states- Angola, Zambia, Tanzania, Mozambique and Botswana- the situation has reached the stage where there is now a real opportunity to reach a satisfactory and internationally acceptable transition to independence and majority rule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The main recommendation of the working party was that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the River Murray Commission be expanded to enable it to take water quality into account in its operations and investigations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth also took another farreaching initiative in October 1977 when it convened a Commonwealth-State ministerial meeting to discuss the development of a co-ordinating plan of action on a broad regional basis to tackle serious salinity and drainage problems in the Murray Valley which are beyond the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the River Murray Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 1976 the present Government agreed to expand the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Export Finance Insurance Corporation to allow it to provide performance bonds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government has given no good reason why the Australian Corporation should not have trading <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Bill provided for the establishment of a similar organisation to the one which this Bill proposes but the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that that legislation gave to the Corporation were broader and the intention was much clearer that it had the power to do certain things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions of this Corporation are vastly different from those that were proposed for the Australian Overseas Trading Corporation by the Australian Labor Party in, I think, 1975 when it was in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Overseas Projects Corporation will not be given the <span class="highlight">powers</span> to exercise a trading function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I tried to get the Minister to admit, but he is not prepared to do so on the floor of this chamber, that the charters and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the very bodies he has mentioned- the Australian Wool Corporation, the Australian Dairy Corporation, and the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation- were brought in by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government did not do anything to alter those charters and <span class="highlight">powers</span> because it knows that what we did was right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is hanging that, as is traditional, I admit, on the constitutional defence <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have also been advised that the Committee has no <span class="highlight">powers</span>, that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> rest in the Presiding Officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think the option of the American system of a rigid division of <span class="highlight">powers</span> is an acceptable alternative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is not individual privileges or <span class="highlight">powers</span> that I am talking about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am also opposed to any suggestion of abolishing the money <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is now placed in the list of <span class="highlight">powers</span> generally described as concurrent; that is to say, the States may occupy the ground until the Federal authority interferes and displaces them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must remember that there are no particular <span class="highlight">powers</span> written into the Constitution to acquire property for Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this debate on the first reading of the Bill I appeal to the Government to take action to try to test the <span class="highlight">powers</span> it has under the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Minister not say at Question Time earlier today that the Government exercises all possible options and <span class="highlight">powers</span> towards containing costs in the Australian community? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The borrowing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the authority are contained in section 26 of the Principal Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent years, indeed in recent maiden speeches by honourable senators on both sides of this House, the role of the Senate has been analysed, either to destroy or to enhance its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I for one would not forgo any part of its unique character or sacrifice one iota of its inherent <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But these disputes will continue and multiply until we take back some of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> to make decisions about the future of this nation which previous parliaments have so cavalierly given away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Constitution provides the Commonwealth with <span class="highlight">powers</span> to make laws with respect to weights and measures under section 51. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed new section 1  8AF  provides explicitly for the Commission to delegate certain of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> to its senior permanent officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the Commission meets only every few months it is necessary to delegate <span class="highlight">powers</span> in regard to staff appointments, promotions, and resignations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the Bill broadens and modernises the functions of the Organisation and invests the Organisation with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> necessary to execute these responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 6 redefines the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions of the Organisation although they continue to be expressed in broad terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The CSIRO will be expected to pursue policies which will encourage and facilitate the use of the results of its research and will have <span class="highlight">powers</span> to join in the formation of a company or partnership with commercial interests for the purpose of developing a discovery or invention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions of the Board as set down in Sections 16 and 17 of the ‘Wine Overseas Marketing Act 1929’ are comprehensive but should be viewed in the context of the Board’s responsibilities both in Australia and overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is noteworthy that these <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions were amended in 1953-54 to confirm the Board’s authority to undertake Australian promotional activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not as though the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that be were not aware that it would happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it further the case that one of the major drains on funds has proved to be the separate representation of children in Family Court proceedings, as directed by judges of that court in the exercise of their <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the Family Law Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This degree of penetration by transnational corporations into national economies means that a large sector of industry has become more or less immune to government intervention and throws into relief the absurd theories of those who claim that there ought to be less government intervention when in fact we are living in a period when international intervention is reducing the limited <span class="highlight">powers</span> which governments have in the economic scene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission are limited constitutionally to conciliation and arbitration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time the Government maintains some responsibility in the area of charging and has, under the relevant legislation, some <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are also related to its having obligations if it seeks to exercise those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does not the acceptance of the new Standing Order relating to the referral of Bills to committees restrict the Senate’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> to refer Bills only to a legislative and general purpose standing committee and then only after the second reading has been agreed to? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Attorney-General seen a report that the Ombudsman, Professor Richardson, wants new <span class="highlight">powers</span> to help citizens fight for social security benefits? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The adoption, on 16 August last, of a new sessional order, providing for reference of any Bill, other than an Appropriation Bill, Supply Bill or Bill imposing taxation, to a Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee does not in any way restrict the Senate’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> to refer Bills to committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third aspect of this item is a question related to the regulation-making <span class="highlight">powers</span> which seem to come very much within the province of the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, which is presently looking into a reference relating to the scrutiny of Bills before the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we make regulatory <span class="highlight">powers</span> which exempt some people from paying the tax or which provide that a refund can be paid, why do we not spell out those people who are entitled to a refund? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister give us some examples of those cases in which, by regulatory <span class="highlight">powers</span>, it may be necessary to exempt a person or class of persons from paying the tax or to grant a refund, in the case of the tax having been paid, to a person or class of persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is a useful and important safeguard to incorporate, given the quite serious and significant <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are vested in the officer in question and the possibility of their being misused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The deputation urged him to use his <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, to order a public inquiry into Wagerup. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An early judgment of the High Court, in the Union Label case in 1 908, concluded that the Commonwealth legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> in respect of trade marks did not extend to marks applied to goods to identify the source of labour employed by the manufacturers of those goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I emphasise that the Bill will ensure that members of the public are fully informed about the structure of Government departments and agencies and the grounds on which they exercise those decision-making <span class="highlight">powers</span> that affect members of the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also have reservations about the ministerial <span class="highlight">powers</span> in respect of the Archives Bill, and I will explain those reservations later on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 6 of the Bill gives extensive <span class="highlight">powers</span> to Archives to enable it to perform its statutory functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister will have power to give directions to the Director-General, not inconsistent with the legislation, in relation to the exercise of his <span class="highlight">powers</span> and duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to the Oppositionand I hope that the Committee will take note of this-that the ministerial <span class="highlight">powers</span> are greater than are justified for material of this nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In summary we would hope that the Committee would examine the length of time that material must be in the possession of the Commonwealth before it is transferred to the archives, the ministerial <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are too great, the exemptions which are too extensive and in some cases not justified at all, the total exemption for ASIO material, the unsatisfactory nature or the limited nature of the appeals provisions against certificates of exemption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Still less should Her Majesty’s judges use their sentencing <span class="highlight">powers</span> to dispose of those who are socially inconvenient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite recent history, I remain unconcerned with the controversies surrounding the existence and acceptance of the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Programs that have been advocated over and over again since 1919, which call for the investiture of unlimited legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> in a single national chamber of delegates, have no acceptable relevance today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his article,  Mr Wise  calls for a return of <span class="highlight">powers</span> and responsibilities to State and local governments, on a scale that even at the present stage of my Government’s new federalism policies does not envisage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Following the recent moves to amalgamate the Commonwealth and Australian Capital Territory police forces into an enlarged new federal agency, what precisely are the Government’s intentions now with respect to the reintroduction of the Criminal Investigation Bill, which the Minister will recall as originally proposed by the Whitlam Labor Government was intended to define and delimit the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of just such a new national police agency? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#debate-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there should be some degree of discretion- as much as the Senate has been opposed to giving Ministers or officers discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span>- in these genuine cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the continued tragic deaths in Rhodesia of so many black and white people being killed by black guerrillas, will the Australian Government encourage the major <span class="highlight">powers</span>- the United Kingdom and the United States of America- to take steps to stop the current butchery by the insurgent guerrillas which is doing nothing to bring about a peaceful solution in Rhodesia, but rather is only bringing about increasing and continuing tragedy to all people in that country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He will make that decision and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Tribunal, which is employed by the Government under the legislative processes of this Parliament and which previously had the responsibility and obligation to carry out its duties to the best of its ability, with the resources available to it under legislation set by the decisions of this Parliament, will be taken away completely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can remember reading- I believe that the Minister brought this up once before in this chamber- that when the original Act was introduced it was the people on the Minister’s side of politics who objected to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> given to the Director-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government believes that the re-definition of the Organisation ‘s <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions are more appropriate to contemporary circumstances and, together with revised management structure and the advisory mechanisms which are set out in this Bill, will create an auspicious and effective foundation for the Organisation’s continued success. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Commission has <span class="highlight">powers</span> to exercise some control over private hospitals, but the definition of a private hospital does not cover surgeries or clinics where only daytime services are provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact remains that unlike the Bantustans in South Africa the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly has virtually no <span class="highlight">powers</span> of self-government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All honourable senators know that a referendum is due to be held on 25 November on what <span class="highlight">powers</span>, if any, are to be passed over to the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Assembly is elected by the people of the Australian Capital Territory, regardless of whether it has <span class="highlight">powers</span> at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A second major issue is involved, that is, the extent to which the wishes of the Legislative Assembly, admittedly without <span class="highlight">powers</span>, nevertheless elected by the people of the Australian Capital Territory, should be taken into account by the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever may be the functions of the Commission, they are circumscribed and contained within the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a question of the Senate <span class="highlight">powers</span> vis-a-vis the Executive? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Ryan  based a substantial element of her argument on them but I do not believe that  Mr Hunt’s  statements can be viewed out of the context in which they have to be seen, and that is in relation to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my contention that  Mr Hunt’s  statements cannot be viewed outside that context of the statutory <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Legislative Assembly as it exists, and certainly not before 25 November when a referendum will be held in the Capital Territory on that issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the people opt for proposal A of the referendum proposals then the Legislative Assembly eventually will have transferred to it <span class="highlight">powers</span> over health matters and will therefore be competent to legislate on them in its own right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the people in the Territory do not opt for proposal A but instead opt for proposal B or C then the Assembly will not have those <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the Government will retain control of those matters as is now the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Rae’s  foreshadowed recision motion is a motion which, if passed, would wipe the slate clean with regard to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister to legislate on private abortion clinics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the work of a number of dedicated growers, there is some evidence indicating irresponsibility on the part of individual growers, a lack of co-ordination between the States, an even more lamentable lack of anti-pollution <span class="highlight">powers</span> among the organisations involved with the management and use of the Murray . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>even more lamentable lack of anti-pollution <span class="highlight">powers</span> among the organisations involved in the management and use of the Murray, and a pressing need for some overall organisation which could analyse the problem and effectively solve it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The points raised by  Senator Young  are very valid, but it was the consideration of our Committee that because the problems of salinity emanate in tributaries of the River Murray, in some cases many hundreds of miles from the River Murray itself, that the Commission itself has no <span class="highlight">powers</span> to deal with the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not of course overcome the fundamental constitutional problem in that even though the Commission may take into account the quality of water, the question remains of how a commission of this kind can enforce regulations over such matters when the <span class="highlight">powers</span> still remain with the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Commission will have some <span class="highlight">powers</span> at least to set some standards to make sure that a State such as South Australia, and the irrigation areas further down the river system, will be fully protected, as they should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking once again of the outback health situation I see that there will be room in this transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> for the re-evaluation of health services to ensure that there is no overlapping and that the money will go further than perhaps it does now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In assessing the need for such a committee we noted that many Bills come before the Parliament which contain provisions that: Significantly interfere with personal rights and liberties; delegate <span class="highlight">powers</span> which, arguably, should not be delegated at all; delegate <span class="highlight">powers</span> to affect rights, liberties and obligations without providing an opportunity for the exercise of those <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be reviewed either by the Parliament itself or by an independent body; or delegate <span class="highlight">powers</span> to impose obligations without any clearly defined guidance as to who is to impose them, upon whom and in which circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nor is there any legal limit on Parliament’s power to confer administrative authority, and other forms of power short of legislative power, provided that such conferring is otherwise within the Commonwealth’s range of constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, therefore, important that Parliament exercise its <span class="highlight">powers</span> carefully and devise its own procedures as to what are proper delegations of power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>make rights, liberties and obligations unduly dependent upon insufficiently denned administrative <span class="highlight">powers</span> or non-reviewable administrative decisions; or <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, the very existence of the Commonwealth’s constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> to act in this area has been called into question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It now appears that the Committee has been able to spell out for the Commonwealth exactly what <span class="highlight">powers</span> it has and what it can do in the future when a government of any State attempts to do what the Queensland Government has attempted to do to the people of Aurukun and Mornington Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the use of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate in the way they have been used this week is proof that the Senate is not a House of review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that in the intervening years the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this Senate can be somewhat curtailed so that the Senate cannot be used as a House of frustration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Just lately, at the same time as this Government was announcing that it had initialled an agreement to sell uranium to South Korea, the South Korean Press came out and pointed out that South Korea had the equipment, it had the warheads and it had the equipment to transport the warheads; and that all it needed was the nuclear warheads and it was then in the race with other larger and stronger <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In summary, the revision provides for a smaller and more compact body, with a wider range of skills and expertise available to it, and widened <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-85-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>While the matters subject to direction are specified in the Bill as a clear indication of the Government’s intention to preserve contributors rights, it is hoped that organisations will administer their rules in a manner which will result in the activation of the Ministerial <span class="highlight">powers</span> of direction only being required in exceptional circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill, like so many before it, has the general aim of increasing the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister for Health to regulate the voluntary health funds in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-93-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is with some amusement that whenever an amendment Bill of this type comes up I remember the days in 1974 and 1975 when, as a supporter of the then Government, I spoke on many occasions on amending legislation introduced to give the then Minister for Health the <span class="highlight">powers</span> to control the voluntary health funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-93-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We will be watching to make sure that the new <span class="highlight">powers</span> given to the Minister will in fact be used by him when they should be used and not left on the shelf when they should be used, as they sometimes are because of the undoubted influence that some of these funds have over the coalition parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-93-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Might I make a small contribution in this debate to clarify what appears to be some misunderstanding, at least on the part of  Senator Walters,  of what are the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the respective committees of this chamber with respect to the kind of problem to which  Senator Cavanagh  has so graphically drawn our attention tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-93-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Like so much of the industrial legislation for which this Government has been responsiblethe establishment of the Industrial Relations Bureau; the amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act significantly increasing the scope of the punitive or penal <span class="highlight">powers</span> under that legislation; and the Commonwealth Employees Act vesting <span class="highlight">powers</span> of suspension, stand down or dismissal of public employees engaged in just about any conceivable form of industrial action; specific provisions of legislation like the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill, aimed quite specifically and directly at particular forms of legitimate trade union protest- this Bill is just another crude and vulgar piece of legislative union-bashing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-86-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The High Court decision, of course, ascribed to the Commonwealth Parliament the full power to legislate in respect of this area but in that decision it did not take away in terms the very considerable <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the States themselves have, in relation not only to the three-mile limit but also probably even further, provided there is a connection between the off-shore activity and the State whose laws are sought to be applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As we approach the nineteen eighties some perceptive commentators are pointing to a dangerous asymmetry: While the Soviet Union is increasing its already enormous military power faster than any other country, and while it is increasingly active in relation to the trouble spots of the world, politically it is the odd-man-out among the great <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I had intended to raise the matter I am about to raise during the debate on the Audit Amendment Bill, which will be coming before the Senate soon and which outlines the responsibility of the Auditor-General to provide for the audit of the Government’s accounts, sets out important controls which are fundamental to the accounting for receipts and payments under the control of parliamentary departments and departments of state and confers important <span class="highlight">powers</span> and responsibilities on the Treasurer for financial management across the entire departmental spectrum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he has used his discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span> in that respect, I would like the Senate Standing Orders Committee to look at Standing Order 99 and to determine whether the <span class="highlight">powers</span> given to the  President  have been used in a way that they should not have been used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The function of the committee would be to scrutinise Bills and report to Parliament about whether the text thereof, expressly or otherwise, did one of three things: First, trespassed unduly on personal rights and liberties; secondly, made rights, liberties and obligations unduly dependent upon insufficiently-denned administrative <span class="highlight">powers</span>, or non-reviewable administrative decisions; or, thirdly, inappropriately delegated legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> or insufficiently subjected its exercise to parliamentary scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>More recently, we have seen the Romanian Government refusing to accept the assessments and the dictates of the Warsaw Pact <span class="highlight">powers</span>, in fact taking a more independent position- perhaps not as independent as Yugoslavia, but independent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All those things happened, but the one country in which we did not learn anything about the various major <span class="highlight">powers</span> was Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But to me the lesson was this: As far as the Western <span class="highlight">powers</span>- we could call them that or a loose alliance of the ANZUS <span class="highlight">powers</span>- are concerned, if we look at it strictly on percentage lines, we are no better off than we would have been if we had not worried about the futile war in Vietnam because by now the ideological rivalries between China and the Soviet Union concerning the land mass of Asia, in particular South Vietnam, would have been apparent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I spoke of my own fear- I do not doubt the fear of other Australians- at being a prime target in a nuclear strategy, because if we engage in a nuclear war that war will take place in a selective way with the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> picking off odd targets in order to show their determination to carry it through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-My advice is that the Customs Act 1901 in its definition of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of officers provides in Clause 184 that ‘the commander or officer in charge of any ship, boat or aircraft in  Her  Majesty’s Service or in the service of the Commonwealth or Customs’ may chase and compel a ship or aircraft to come to port or land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When enforcement action is necessary and a defence vehicle is being used, Customs officers are put on board and they exercise their <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the Act directly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the major Western <span class="highlight">powers</span> are ending or severely restricting their commitment to nuclear power because of the virtual impossibility of long term storage of nuclear waste at acceptable cost, the basic expense of nuclear power, which makes it no longer economic in comparison with other sources, the shorter life of nuclear power houses than was once supposed, and the great cost of actually disposing of plants that have passed their useful life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was recognised by the royal commission which concluded that the Organisation required certain specified <span class="highlight">powers</span> of intelligence collection and that the laws should be changed to this end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, Division 2 of Part III of the Bill provides for certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be exercisable by ASIO subject to significant safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The additional <span class="highlight">powers</span> thus provided for are: to enter premises to search for records; to use listening devices; to open and inspect postal articles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, before such <span class="highlight">powers</span> could be exercised in any particular case, there will need to be a request by the Director-General to the Minister who in turn must be satisfied as to the need for the action before granting a warrant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Balancing this re-definition of the functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of ASIO are a number of important considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will equip ASIO with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> essential for those tasks and at the same time provide safeguards for the rights of individuals and the continuation of our democratic institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security recommended that the Australian Security Intelligence Organization’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> of interception should be extended to interception of information passing over all telecommunications systems and this Bill so provides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian participation in IEA activities will therefore proceed on a basis fully consistent with the Government’s policies and with the Federal constitutional system which governs the division of government <span class="highlight">powers</span> that may be involved in relation to those activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This indicates that the passing over of State <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Northern Territory was probably many years before its time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most important distinguishing feature of the Australian Federal Parliament is the Senate, with its <span class="highlight">powers</span> without parallel in any other second house of parliament in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate are defined in the Constitution and can be altered only by a referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no intention at all to alter those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Far from diminishing the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate or the respect in which it is held, it would enhance them because it would become a more effective body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite recently the American Environmental Protection Agency used emergency <span class="highlight">powers</span> as a result of the pressures applied on it by environmentalists to place bans on 2,4,5-T. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: (1), (2) and (3) On 19 December 1978 I wrote to the Premier of Queensland suggesting that Commonwealth and State officials meet to discuss appropriate arrangements for management of the Great Barrier Reef Region, in the context of the Premiers Conference agreements to extend the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the States into the 3-mile territorial sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could you advise the Senate whether, in actual fact, an extension of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth Police has been agreed to by both yourself and the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives, or whether either of you was consulted about this; also, whether you would consider keeping the Senate informed of any further proposed incursions on the privacy of individuals who may, quite inadvertently, find themselves under the general umbrella of Parliament House security? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, they set out <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions of ASIO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One must have grave doubts- I speak as an individual- about the <span class="highlight">powers</span> given to the Comptroller-General of Customs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point I want to make is that the question of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be given to an agency like ASIO or to bureaucrats in another department or agency is a very delicate and important question in a society which is concerned continually, and properly concerned, about invasions of privacy, the social and political implication of technological advances in communications and in interception of communications which make possible increased invasions of privacy and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In it he asked a number of points about this legislation, particularly as it affects the Comptroller-General of Customs’ <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is distinctly different from this legislation in that we have here an attempt to spell out a detailed charter for ASIO, an attempt to outline its <span class="highlight">powers</span> and responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that Annual Reports be presented to Parliament on the general operation of the Act and in particular the exercise of Special <span class="highlight">Powers</span> under Part III, Division 2 of the Bill; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>) that the Leader of the Opposition be fully and regularly briefed on all aspects of the operation of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization, including the exercise of its Special <span class="highlight">Powers</span> under Part III, Division 2 of the Bill; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that Annual Reports be presented to Parliament on the general operation of the Act and in particular the exercise of Special <span class="highlight">Powers</span> under Part III, Division 2 of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those are the special <span class="highlight">powers</span> which ASIO has in relation to its investigations and collection of intelligence material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this legislation the specification of ASIO’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> does not guarantee that they will not be abused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first paragraph of the amendment which I have moved relates to the special <span class="highlight">powers</span> of ASIO contained in Part III Division 2 of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In  our view the Director-General’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> have been increased at the expense of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this case it would be very dangerous for the incumbent to have wide discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor do we oppose any genuine attempt to put the Organisation’s structure, functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> on a proper statutory basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They represent a set of additional institutional checks and balances which we believe are crucially necessary if ASIO is to be able to command any kind of confidence that it is not misusing its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also hope that an annual report to Parliament would provide and put on the public record quite specific details about the exercise of this extraordinary array of special <span class="highlight">powers</span> which is now to be provided both in this Bill and reinforced in the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill which is also before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Puplick  has stated, clause 8 of the present Bill confers upon the Minister of the day general <span class="highlight">powers</span> to give directions to the Director-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it limits his specific <span class="highlight">powers</span> to give directions in a number of specified ways, some of which we believe are unacceptable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the basis on which the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Organisation to do anything are defined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next matter for concern, from the Opposition ‘s point of view, is of course, the whole section of the Bill dealing with special <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the warrants pursuant to which those <span class="highlight">powers</span> can be exercised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a central feature of this Bill and the telecommunications Bills which go with it and which vest wholly new <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me try to convey to the Senate some impression of just how staggering the implications for civil liberties and, in particular, of personal privacy are if these <span class="highlight">powers</span> are exercised on any kind of substantial or regular basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now it is a matter of lively debate just how far one goes towards resolving the legitimate worries it is possible to have about the extent and application and operation of these <span class="highlight">powers</span>, whether one should have only judicial warrants in this area or limit the operation of the provision in some other way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After a great deal of consideration the Government has approved additional <span class="highlight">powers</span> for ASIO to enter premises, to search for records, to use listening devices and to open and inspect postal articles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before these <span class="highlight">powers</span> can be exercised in any particular case the Director-General of ASIO has to make a formal request and the Minister must be satisfied that there is need for this action before he can grant a warrant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second part of the Opposition’s amendment with which I would like to deal is paragraph (d) which states:  that the Leader of the Opposition be fully and regularly briefed on all aspects of the operation of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, including the exercise of its Special <span class="highlight">Powers</span> under Part III, Division 2 of the Bill . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">powers</span> include its <span class="highlight">powers</span> of entry, its <span class="highlight">powers</span> to use listening devices and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister’s Department or any Federal body other than the Trade Practices Commission- which lists only bannings under its own <span class="highlight">powers</span>- list, record or make available to the public, retailers or manufacturers information on product recalls, failure to meet safety standards and product bannings? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee believes that all organisations should outline in their annual reports the <span class="highlight">powers</span>, functions and objectives of their charter, whether statutory or otherwise, indicating how each is being exercised and fulfilled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was a major turning point for many countries, especially small and middle <span class="highlight">powers</span> like Australia, towards the thought that they should arm themselves with a naval capacity of missile armed patrol boats or fast attack craft as a basic and important aspect of naval strength. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 48 countries which now have fast patrol boats or attack craft are mostly middle <span class="highlight">powers</span> like Australia- not all of them but most of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not persuaded by the argument that other middle <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the world can afford this kind of thing but we cannot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That there be no transmission of programs between the hours of 6 a.m. and 9 a.m. on weekdays during school terms and that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal take the necessary action to implement this recommendation in accordance with its <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the Act to determine the hours of transmission of all commercial television stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is prepared to exercise those statutory <span class="highlight">powers</span> that it has to bring about an improvement in children’s television; unless it is prepared to look again at the recommendation of the 1953 royal commission that some form of legal compulsion for better and more adequate children’s television should be considered; I believe that the tribunal will have proved itself to be a waste of the time and effort of people who hoped that public participation in the shaping of broadcasting standards and attitudes would bring about a response such that legitimate commercial considerations would be married with the desires of the community and the right that the community has that the public airways should serve legitimate public needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some 35 per cent of the total debates during the constitutional conventions of the 1890s was devoted to the question of what ought to be the Senate’s role and its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first thing the report does is make a quite detailed analysis of section 5 1 (xxvi) of the Constitution, the Commonwealth’s power to make laws with respect to people of any race for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws, a provision which assumed that form as a result of the 1 967 Aboriginal <span class="highlight">powers</span> referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee refers to Parliament’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the definition of special laws and questions whether Parliament is restricted from making particular laws for one race of people which may be contrary to the rights given in law to another race of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer in particular to the Local Government Act which has been passed by the Queensland Government and which gives government officials extraordinary <span class="highlight">powers</span> over Aborigines, partly because leases are vested in local authorities, which may be one non-Aboriginal person, as at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The official has <span class="highlight">powers</span> to authorise entry and residence and trusteeship of leases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tonight, in listening to the debate in the other place, I noted the very determined and insolent attitude of the Treasurer of this country,  Mr Howard,  who threw down the gauntlet to the New South Wales Government because it dared to exercise its sovereign <span class="highlight">powers</span> in respect of an industrial and economic matter that affected a section of its work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That legislation, says the Minister’s own Department, is in the Commonwealth Government’s view discriminatory and outdated, primarily because it gives government officials extraordinary <span class="highlight">powers</span> to manage and direct the lives of Aborigines and Islanders on reserves, trusteeships on reserves and the right to negotiate on behalf of Aborigines and Islanders about land use and in particular exploration and mining on reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not about time that those men and women of goodwill in the Government parties asserted themselves, if not successfully in the party room, for God ‘s sake then in this place and said to the Australian Government that the Senate is exercising some of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> and responsibility as a States’ House which says what it is concerned about is people and not institutions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was brought about by the stock-piling at some depots and the Egg Board ‘s rightly exercising its <span class="highlight">powers</span> to send to other agents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, it could lead to an abuse of <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for that reason, if for no other, that we are concerned at the extraordinary <span class="highlight">powers</span> given to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the Director-General and the Minister under this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, if the police abuse their <span class="highlight">powers</span> or if ASIO abuses its <span class="highlight">powers</span>,  Senator Puplick, Senator Durack  or any other lawyer or politician, because of their training and positions, can object straight to the Chief Commissioner or to the Director-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My concern is that this Bill gives so many <span class="highlight">powers</span> to ASIO agents that little people who are affected by it have no such redress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission to carry out the sort of development that was necessary for the purpose of the Urban Land Council was recently challenged in the Supreme Court of Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It protested against the development permit being granted to the Housing Commission in respect of the Housing Commission’s land claiming that, as a matter of law, the Commission had acted beyond its legal <span class="highlight">powers</span> in seeking and obtaining permits on behalf of the Victorian body, the Urban Land Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before these <span class="highlight">powers</span> are exercised, ASIO’s Director-General must apply to the Attorney-General for a warrant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has many reservations about the new <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are given to ASIO under the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If new <span class="highlight">powers</span> are to be given it is all the more important that the terms of the operation should be properly defined, and they are not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had many examples in this country of ASIO- when not subject to scrutiny, to proper accountabilityabusing its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bills seek to replace the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Act of 1956, a very small Act which did not spell out <span class="highlight">powers</span> to any great degree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have before us very elaborate provisions which seek to give enormous <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Director-General and officers of ASIO and therefore they must be considered carefully. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently I think we have to be all the more careful in respect of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that we may give. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague,  Senator Puplick,  in a speech which I think was one of the most distinguished contributions to this debate, set out the very great need for the security organisation with adequate <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation sets out- and I am mainly dealing with the ASIO Bill- the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Director-General and the functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Organization. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, whilst these considerable <span class="highlight">powers</span> of search, the provision for listening devices and for postal inspection are, I think, terrifying <span class="highlight">powers</span> in a sense, it is better of course that they should be set out in a Bill and not left as they were in the past to assumed <span class="highlight">powers</span> which officers of ASIO sometimes undertook and which were criticised to some extent in the Hope report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I think we must be conscious of the fact that we can have mistaken or unfortunate officers at times who hold such vital <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all I say in this general statement about the legislation that we must be careful of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are given because there is strong evidence in the Hope reports of the fact that there have been deficiencies in the past and that mistakes have been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But my recommendations shall include safeguards to ensure that ASIO does not exceed the recommended <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 1 7 of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill sets out the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions which the Organization should employ. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must recognise that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> given in this Act are stronger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 8 of the Bill, which deals with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Director-General, has been a subject of considerable criticism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a dual problem because it deals with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the DirectorGeneral and points out that in regard to a particular individual it is not possible for the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have indicated that I accept the general definition of <span class="highlight">powers</span> set out in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the context of the overall situation and the great <span class="highlight">powers</span> that have been given to ASIO and will be given to it under this Bill, I hope that there will be a finite limit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a time when the citizens and the Government of the United States of America are concerning themselves with an investigation into one of their own secret organisations- the Central Intelligence Agency- in relation to the pruning of some of its <span class="highlight">powers</span>, we have the Government of this country being prepared to give a similar organisation greater <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One other area where I believe an organisation such as ASIO presents danger to a nation is the opportunity that such organisations provide for infiltration by really dedicated double agents and operators for foreign <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would now like to talk about the additional <span class="highlight">powers</span> that have been granted to ASIO under this Bill, a matter that seems to be of concern to quite a number of honourable senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those additional <span class="highlight">powers</span> concern the entering of premises to search for records, the use of listening devices and the opening and inspection of mail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to these three additional <span class="highlight">powers</span> there are safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As long as there are <span class="highlight">powers</span> limiting the duration of the warrant to 48 hours, then I believe that that is reasonable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that Annual Reports be presented to Parliament on the general operation of the Act and in particular the exercise of Special <span class="highlight">Powers</span> under Part III, Division 2 of the Bill; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the Leader of the Opposition be fully and regularly briefed on all aspects of the operation of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization, including the exercise of its Special <span class="highlight">Powers</span> under Part III, Division 2 of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Does the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs not agree that the treaty signed this week by the  President  of Egypt and the Prime Minister of Israel is one of the most encouraging events in international relations for the past 30 years and that any efforts taken by any <span class="highlight">powers</span> or parties to destroy this settlement, however many problems may remain unresolved, ought to be resisted vigorously? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also gives the responsible Minister of the day certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> in respect of his relationship with the Authority and an ability to give directions to the Authority on a matter which the second reading speech describes as ‘a matter of policy’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia and these countries all possess in protecting ourselves from armed attack by external <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The two super-<span class="highlight">powers</span> could do it if they had motive and unrestrained mind and opportunity; and there are two or three European navies which still have a fairly substantial trans-oceanic capability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could think of a second tier of maritime <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no way that a member of this second tier of maritime <span class="highlight">powers</span> could acquire the kind of maritime strength necessary to dominate the sea approaches to Australia without its naval program becoming blindingly obvious, and without the process taking that country an appreciable span of years, and I stress the word years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With Harpoon missiles and the Barra Sonobuoys to come- and they are in the program- the Orions will have remarkable <span class="highlight">powers</span> both to seek and to destroy at long range in the approaches to Australia- and beyond, if that should be the mission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we seek to justify giving these <span class="highlight">powers</span> to an organisation in the name of security, we are doing far more than just providing security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are concerned of course to see the Australian Government so indifferent when its citizens are being harassed by foreign <span class="highlight">powers</span> in Australia, imprisoned by a foreign power abroad and even executed by a foreign power abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In anticipation of these changes, and at the request of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs following his statement of 18 October last, the Tribunal used its exemption <span class="highlight">powers</span> to release prescribed companies from the notification procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A provision is included in the Bill to allow the Minister to issue general directions to the PJT as to any matter which should be given special consideration by it in the performance of its functions and the exercise of its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I suggested in my question on 22 March, I believe that the Commonwealth Government, because of its unique and, in our Federal system, unusual role in the Federal Territory, has a responsibility to examine this matter because we do not have a government, State or local, with any executive <span class="highlight">powers</span> that might introduce some scheme of preferences or incentives for our local companies and industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intention of this Bill is to broaden the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of ASIO and legitimise its previously illegal activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this legislation the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of ASIO to spy and snoop are to remain almost limitless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my colleague  Senator Cavanagh  said, the special <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be granted to ASIO, including <span class="highlight">powers</span> of forced entry, search, removal of documents, bugging and the interception of mail, pose a grave threat to personal freedoms and open up a whole range of abusive activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The public ventilation of the abuses in the United States in the reports to which I have referred has contributed to a curbing of the oppressive <span class="highlight">powers</span> of organisations such as the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under section 1 7 the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of ASIO are limited to obtaining, correlating and evaluating of intelligence relevant to security, communicating that information to others and advising Ministers in relation to those activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So long as ASIO does not act as a police force- it has no <span class="highlight">powers</span> of arrest- I cannot see that the criticism which honourable senators opposite make of the Organisation is valid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As in all enterprises, however, the most important thing will be the character and the wisdom of the people to whom the <span class="highlight">powers</span> are entrusted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has introduced amendments to the Customs Act concerning narcotics and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of customs officials to intercept telecommunications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to areas of employment where the Commonwealth has appropriate legal <span class="highlight">powers</span> relating to terms and conditions of employment, within the full limits of those <span class="highlight">powers</span> a firm policy has been adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will be resisted by the Government with all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> it can bring to bear to make all parties work within the established system for settling differences in industrial relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point that I am making is this: If the word ultimately’ stays in the Bill then we have caught up as potentially subversive- therefore subject to all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are vested in the Organisation by this Act- all those rather pathetic little splinter groups particularly of the far Left which engage in most cases more out of a sense of duty rather than any real belief in fuzzy, millenarian rhetoric about the ultimate revolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the final decisions about ASIO’s structure, its function and <span class="highlight">powers</span>, are political and Parliament must take the final responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The establishing of a Director-General with more clearly defined statutory responsibilities and <span class="highlight">powers</span> is also an improvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in certain circumstances ASIO should have these <span class="highlight">powers</span> but they should be used in emergency situations only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This section of the Bill could compromise the AttorneyGeneral at the best of times and, at worst, could allow ASIO’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be dangerously abused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one which the Parliament of course is frequently dealing with but somehow or other it probably is brought into starker relief by this type of legislation, particularly when it does contain <span class="highlight">powers</span> in respect of such things as using listening devices, opening mail, tapping telephones, the entry to premises and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There probably is a greater collection of such <span class="highlight">powers</span> all in the one package of legislation than certainly would normally be presented to the Parliament; so very clearly there is that dilemma. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He came to the very firm conclusion that that organisation had to have <span class="highlight">powers</span> adequate for the performance of the duties which would be placed upon it- duties which of course ultimately are placed upon it by the vote of a democratic parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to the motion for the second reading of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill, the Opposition has proposed that the Bill be withdrawn and redrafted with a number of amendments; but, as I have said, it is significant that the Opposition has not opposed the legislation and that, in the principles it is suggesting should be inserted, it has not really opposed what I regard as the fundamental requirements and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Organisation which are contained in the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first proposal by the Opposition is that annual reports should be presented to Parliament on the general operation of the legislation, particularly in relation to the exercise of the special <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But whether details should be given about the exercise of special <span class="highlight">powers</span> is another matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No provision exists in the legislation for the Prime Minister to be informed about the exercise of each of the special <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government does not remind the people who run these areas that a referendum was held in 1967 which gave the Commonwealth very wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> to legislate for Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer in particular to an article headed <span class="highlight">Powers</span> that Be- Chaney answers the land rights critics: make the system work’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this clause is to define the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to collect intelligence about certain activities, certain organisations and people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation is concerned with giving ASIO its charter, its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Powers</span> of this kind are required so that the Organisation, if it believes in its professional judgment that an organisation should be brought under investigation at any time, will have the power to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to add to that discretion- namely, the permitting of an ASIO officer to make a judgment that an activity which is not itself involving violence, which is not intended to involve violence but which may be likely to lead to violence- the element of ‘ultimately’ leading to violence seems to me to be asking the ASIO officer, as  Senator Button  pointed out, to engage in tremendous <span class="highlight">powers</span> of foresight and prophecy because he has to look at an activity now and make the judgment that in some supposed chronological sequence of events it will lead to the violent or unlawful overthrowing of a government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are talking about a definition of ‘subversion’ which, if satisfied, will bring into play the operation of some quite extraordinary, far-reaching and very dangerous <span class="highlight">powers</span>; <span class="highlight">powers</span> to tap telephones, install listening devices, open mail, intercept telegrams and enter and search premises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the <span class="highlight">powers</span> we are talking about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition, with some reservations, would say that that situation is a reasonable one in which the <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be available to the Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">powers</span>, we concede, albeit reluctantly, ought to be available where what is happening now is subversive in the language of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We go so far as to say that these <span class="highlight">powers</span> also ought to be available if something is likely to happen in the reasonably foreseeable future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are alarmed about when we consider the range of <span class="highlight">powers</span> that attach to the application of the definition of subversion is that this kind of remote, unforeseeable and extremely distant contingency will set those <span class="highlight">powers</span> in operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We consider, from the kind of civil libertarian perspective that we hope the Government is adopting in this Bill, that those <span class="highlight">powers</span> should not be vested in the Organisation, particularly given the appalling track record of officers of the Organisation for any kind of intelligent prophecy about or analysis of the nature of existing organisations, let alone what they are likely to do in the unforeseeably distant future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise again that we are here dealing with definitions of domestic subversion, or activities on the domestic scene that may be regarded as of a subversive character, for the purpose of defining the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was a very general proposition by  Mr Justice  Hope and this particular limb of clause 5 ( 1 ) (b), which lends a little more particularity to  Mr Justice  Hope’s recommendation, is simply saying that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the or- the activities of persons which are directed- I emphasise the word ‘directed’- to obstructing, hindering or interfering with the performance by the Defence Force of its functions, or the carrying out of other activities by or for the Commonwealth for the purpose of the security or defence thereof. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that we on this side of the chamber want to do is to lay down some sort of criteria because the Director-General has incredibly wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this legislation, and we would agree necessarily so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, the Government believes that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of a security organisation in relation to subversion should be wide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> are based broadly upon recommendations of  Mr Justice  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These dates reveal that there has been a delay of three years in carrying out this undertaking, and in the meantime the mail of citizens of the country has been opened in accordance with regulations which the Committee and the Minister agreed in 1976 conferred excessive <span class="highlight">powers</span> upon officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is our view that this clause should contain no reference to hostility or hatred being promoted between different groups in the Australian community as being one of the criteria of subversion, this enabling the various <span class="highlight">powers</span> contained in this legislation to be exercised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The person who will be applying these definitions is primarily none other than the Attorney-General himself in the exercise of his <span class="highlight">powers</span>, in conjunction with the Director-General, under this legislation- in particular, his <span class="highlight">powers</span> to issue warrants for electronic surveillance, search and seizure and so on of people who can be characterised as subversive according to these definitions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We talk about the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">powers</span> to make laws in respect of peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth in relation to lighthouses, shipping buoys or meteorological observations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not here creating offences but simply giving <span class="highlight">powers</span> to a security organisation to be exercised in certain circumstances, one of them being in this area of domestic subversion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suspect that some holders of ministerial positions during my time in this Parliament have abused their <span class="highlight">powers</span> for political advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real significance of giving the Leader of the Opposition this degree of knowledge, this access to the working of the system, is of course as  Senator Cavanagh  pointed out, because of the very fact that the knowledge of the Leader of the Opposition of these things will act as a disincentive, as an obvious deterrent, to any latent tendency which there may be on the part of the Attorney-General of the day to use his position, to use his <span class="highlight">powers</span> for party political purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will be discussing the ministerial <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to this matter at a later stage; but I do not think that, by and large, it is suitable for the Minister to insist on information of this kind being provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is one of the reasons why we have considerably limited the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of a Minister in relation to individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, as  Mr Justice  Hope acknowledges, there was the accepted view that he had complete authority, <span class="highlight">powers</span> of direction and access to records and premises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sensitive question of access should not be concealed within the language of clause 8 (2), which is just about <span class="highlight">powers</span> of direction, although obviously a direction could be given to give access to material and it could be argued that access is subsumed within clause 8 (2). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would regard it as desirable to have an explicit clause setting out, in language which no one can misunderstand, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Attorney-General and the limitations on the Attorney-General’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> insofar as access to files is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, we see the real disincentive for any tendency on the part of a Director-General to misuse his <span class="highlight">powers</span>- and he is the one who will have access to these individual files- as being the notion of the judicial audit, the process of another spring cleaning job from  Mr Justice  Hope or, in the case of South Australia,  Mr Justice  White or somebody else every three years or so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that there is not the security in which a Director-General can make decisions and exercise the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which he has under clause 8 and other clauses of which I strongly approve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where it is a matter of supplying information to another State, even though it is done indirectly through a Commonwealth Department, I would not have thought that it would come within the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Director-General unless that clause were changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if this is the way in which information is to be supplied to the State authorities, then it ought to be made perfectly clear in the legislation that this is within the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Director-General and that there will be the opportunity for people to appeal in these circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Director’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> of delegation were amended to allow delegation of appropriate functions to persons, including Aboriginals or groups of Aboriginals, who would not previously have been eligible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Senate should exercise its <span class="highlight">powers</span> and direct the  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment,  Senator Jessop,  to police this matter rigidly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first thing it did was to make a detailed analysis of section 5 1 (xxvi) of the Constitution, which relates to the Commonwealth’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> to make laws in respect of people of any race for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a provision which came within the ambit of Commonwealth <span class="highlight">powers</span> following the 1 967 Aboriginal <span class="highlight">powers</span> referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>in the event of such agreement, legislative action and negotiations failing to provide satisfactory means for self-management, the Senate requests the Commonwealth Government to give urgent consideration to (and advise the Parliament of its intentions in regard to) the amendment of the existing Commonwealth legislation or the introduction of new legislation to ensure effective  self-mangement  for the Aurukun and Mornington Island Aboriginal communities, and other Aboriginal communities, pursuant to the substantial <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth as examined in the Senate Committee’s Report’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We tried to set aside the fault that has developed in this country for years, namely, that we have doubted the <span class="highlight">powers</span> ofthe Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It shows that the Senate recognises that the Commonwealth has <span class="highlight">powers</span> which ought to be kept in reserve and used when necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs not agree that the treaty signed this week by the  President  of Egypt and the Prime Minister of Israel is one of the most encouraging events in international relations for the past 30 years and that any efforts taken by any <span class="highlight">powers</span> or parties to destroy this settlement, however many problems may remain unresolved, ought to be resisted vigorously? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But this part of the Bill gives ASIO unprecedented sweeping new additional <span class="highlight">powers</span> with respect to the interception and inspection of mail, the installation of listening devices, the entering and searching of premises and the removal of material found therein. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are to be conferred upon ASIO in this way are quite unprecedented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regrettably, however, the absence in the past of these formal legal <span class="highlight">powers</span> to do these things does not appear to have stopped the Organisation from actually exercising them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must also be remembered that ASIO has been asked over many years to carry out its functions without the extensive special <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the police have, and without guidelines on questions of propriety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is very cautious judicious language- It does not set out in any specific detail particular cases of transgression but it does amount, I suggest, to a quite farreaching indictment nonetheless of the misbehaviour of ASIO in the past and to its utter indifference to the absence from its repertoire of the kind of <span class="highlight">powers</span> which it is now proposed to insert in that repertoire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I concede that if it could be established that the investigative <span class="highlight">powers</span> in question were absolutely necessary to enable the proper performance of ASIO’s functions, there might be a case for inserting the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are proposed to be inserted by this Division of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, what we have been told by  Mr Justice  Hope is that these <span class="highlight">powers</span> should not be used when there is any possibility of the information which is being sought being obtainable by other means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The substance of the amendment is that the Minister shall not issue any warrant in respect of any of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> to install listening devices, to intercept mail or to engage in illegal burglary as I have described it unless he is satisfied on reasonable grounds that other lawful methods of investigation have proved insufficient or impracticable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole Division which is the subject of this discussion raises a number of questions about the proper safeguards which ought to be attached to the exercise of these <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That amendment ought to be looked at in the context ofthe Opposition’s whole approach to the question of safeguards around the exercise of these draconic <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One such safeguard that ought to be mentioned specifically, because it has occasioned a degree of public comment, is that the warrants that are to be issued to enable the exercise of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> should not be granted by the Minister, but rather by a court, as is the situation by and large in the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would certainly acknowledge that there is a strong prima facie reason for making warrants authorising the exercise of these investigative <span class="highlight">powers</span> judicial rather than ministerial, the argument being that that would ensure that an element of independence comes into the decisionmaking process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, members of the Opposition say, and we will go on saying it and moving amendments to try to establish it, that there should be accountability in the form of reports to Parliament on the way in which these <span class="highlight">powers</span> have been exercisedfurther and very detailed reports not going to the specific subject matter, perhaps, of phone taps and listening device installations and so on that are in issue, but certainly at least going to the number of such taps and installations and surveillance exercises and occasions of legal burglary that are engaged in in the course of any one year, and some indication as to the subject matter which occasioned those exercises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not mean financial auditing but a scrutiny being undertaken on a regular basis, perhaps every three or four years, by a judge, or someone of that independent stature, who can come in and check and see for himself that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> in question have not been misused by the Minister and by the agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, when we are talking, as we are now, about these special <span class="highlight">powers</span>, we regard it as necessary that the scope and extent of those <span class="highlight">powers</span> be modified in other ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We regard it as crucial that there should be some explicit statutory direction that these <span class="highlight">powers</span>, with all their draconic implications, should not be utilised at all unless in a situation where other methods of investigation, or other methods of information seeking by ordinary techniques, have proved quite impracticable or manifestly insufficient in all the circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say in summary- I will add further weight to this point later- that the reason why the Opposition is insisting upon this amendment and is so concerned about it is simply the magnitude of the invasions of personal liberty and, in particular, personal privacy that are associated with the exercises of these <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Evans  began his remarks by saying that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred generally in Division 2 of this Bill were legally unprecedented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, therefore, perhaps not surprising to find that, in legislation which is considerably older than this piece of legislation, those <span class="highlight">powers</span> were not provided for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is sad and regrettable that it appears that these <span class="highlight">powers</span> are necessary in order to bring about the sort of control of subversive and illegal activities at which this Bill is aimed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that the Opposition is trying to do is guarantee that the Minister turns his attention explicitly to the question before he enables the exercise of these draconic <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the consideration of whether, in all the circumstances that are put before him and revealed to him, he is satisfied that the other available methods of investigation have proved impracticable or insufficient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not go in any way to strike at the foundations of the Bill or the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that will be available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the reality of the matter is that the nature of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are here being exercised are so sweeping and have such enormous implications that the burden involved on the Minister by comparison is trivial indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not have much information on the record as to just how these <span class="highlight">powers</span> have been exercised in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, what we do have, put on the record by  Senator Murphy  in 1973, is at least some indication of how these <span class="highlight">powers</span> and associated <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the area of telephone tapping have been utilised in a 10-year period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my knowledge this is the only information that has been placed on the public record as to the actual numerical extent of the exercise of telephone tapping <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we now have to think not only about telephone tapping <span class="highlight">powers</span> but also the installation of listening devices and all the other <span class="highlight">powers</span> to which I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the kind of assumption we must make in the absence of alternative or additional information, which we would be delighted to have from the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  if he were prepared to give it to us, as to the actual number of conversations overheard in the exercise of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> enjoyed at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has to be appreciated that this is the magnitude of the invasion of civil liberties and privacy that is potentially involved in the exercise of these <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I contest the assertion that the exercise of surveillance <span class="highlight">powers</span> on the scale that has been exercised in the past and will be exercised in the future does not do anyone any damage and that the mere existence of this squirrelling away of informationgathering activity does not in itself do any harm and should not in any event cause any neurosis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason I say that is the well established and accepted argument, certainly in the United States, that the implications of the use of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> go primarily to the chilling effect that their use has on the political activity which is essential to the workings of democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why it is important that these <span class="highlight">powers</span> ought not to be exercised unless the Minister has given careful and detailed consideration to their implications and their necessity in a particular case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the context of  the Commission’s discussion on the exercise of <span class="highlight">powers</span> of surveillance by the police, at page 107 of its report the Commissioner stated that the authorisation, giving or granting of warrants for the exercise of surveillance <span class="highlight">powers</span> should ‘only be available when other investigative procedures have been tried and failed or would be impracticable’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Am I not correct in saying in response to the suggested compromise which has been canvassed by Peter Samuel and a reporter with the  Canberra Times,  that by ‘cultural centres’ we do not mean organisations which eulogise people who in World War II were more friendly with the axis <span class="highlight">powers</span> than with the Allies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790503_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate is well aware that there are divisions of State and Commonwealth <span class="highlight">powers</span> and that these need resolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790503_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore the declaration should not proceed until formal extension of State <span class="highlight">powers</span> over the territorial sea has been accomplished in line with the decisions taken at the Premiers ‘Conference in June 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lastly, to avoid any difficulties with the Queensland Government, the proclamation of the park should be held up pending resolution of extension of Queensland <span class="highlight">powers</span> into off-shore waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have indicated clearly that the proclamation of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is delayed pending the resolution with Queensland of the question of extending its <span class="highlight">powers</span> into the territorial sea in the region of the reef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am anxious to ensure that there is no impediment to the declaration of the Park once the primary issue of extending State <span class="highlight">powers</span> into the territorial seas has been settled and I am prepared to take every step which I think is necessary, in consultation with Queensland as appropriate, to achieve that end as soon as practicable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as I have said, and as I now repeat, that is a matter which is delayed pending resolution of the question of extending State <span class="highlight">powers</span> into the territorial sea- a factor which I have stressed in the Senate previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore the declaration should not proceed until formal extension of State <span class="highlight">powers</span> over the territorial sea has been accomplished in line with the decisions taken at the Premiers Conference in 1 978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The constitutional settlement of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> relating to the marine parks is a matter which is under intense discussion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been suggested that this is a matter upon which the Commonwealth Government could legislate under certain of its <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I am very thankful that nobody has proposed that we should attempt to exercise those <span class="highlight">powers</span> on the subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All our proposals to make ASIO more accountable to the Australian people, because it exercises these extraordinary <span class="highlight">powers</span>, were rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second main category of our objection to the Bill as drafted was as to the event which triggers the exercise of these extraordinary <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We felt that that position was so dangerous that we were obliged to urge that further constraints concerning the actual exercise of <span class="highlight">powers</span> be written into the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, our three main categories of objection to the Bill- accountability, the trigger mechanism which sets the <span class="highlight">powers</span> in motion, and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> themselves- are in a sort of descending order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The greater the accountability, the tighter the definition of subversive activity, the more readily the Opposition might have accepted the exercise of <span class="highlight">powers</span> as contained in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the logic of his somewhat impassioned intervention in this Committee debate would seem to me to indicate that he is really opposed to the special <span class="highlight">powers</span> in this Division of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Division provides some special <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course there are <span class="highlight">powers</span> in related legislation such as the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill which we are debating cognately with this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These special <span class="highlight">powers</span> are provided on the basis that a case for their being exercised is made out to the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would expect that the Minister or the Attorney-General would have some broad interests in these matters and would discuss with the Director-General or other officers the grounds on which and the circumstances in which special <span class="highlight">powers</span> would be sought, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>True enough, overall that is the scheme of the Bill, but this Division of the Bill at which we are looking now- Division 2 of Part III- the special <span class="highlight">powers</span> division of the Bill- does not operate that way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This division, with the exception of the emergency power provision- let us leave that to one side and deal with it when we come to it- operates quite explicitly and directly to vest <span class="highlight">powers</span> not in the Director-General, with only a supervisory role for the Minister, but in the Minister himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under those circumstances, it is incumbent upon this Parliament to be satisfied that the guidelines provided in the Bill as to the way in which the Minister does exercise those <span class="highlight">powers</span> are in fact satisfactory and do spell out all the considerations which should be present to the Minister’s mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly, what it does not do, and what this amendment is designed to correct, is to specify quite directly and explicitly some of the, as it were, civil libertarian considerations which ought to be present in the Minister’s mind before issuing warrants of the draconian effect that these warrants over search and seizure <span class="highlight">powers</span>, inspection of the mails and the installation of listening devices actually represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that sufficient importance has been attached to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the amendment seeks to grant within reasonable limits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must confess that it is an approach that the Opposition is becoming steadily less inclined to accept as the evening wears on and the Attorney-General’s and the Government’s recalcitrance becomes more and more apparent in respect of what we have been insisting throughout this debate are necessary and proper safeguards which must govern the exercise of these extremely wideranging <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In essence the central argument is that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> in question, and in particular, of course, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> to install a listening device, are draconic ones of potentially extremely farreaching application. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That consideration makes it so much more important that within the text of the description in the Bill of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> themselves there be some greater degree of safeguard governing their exercise than appears in the Bill at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we take the view that a period of 90 days or three months- a period which the Government has itself employed in respect of certain other classes of special <span class="highlight">powers</span>, in particular, the power relating to the interception of postal articles- as the initial maximum period is a period which the Government ought to be prepared to accept as a proper limitation on the perhaps casual, cavalier or unthinking exercise of these <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are dealing with a Division giving special <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation in relation to searching premises and using listening devices, intercepting and inspecting mail, based upon warrants that have been given by the Minister after application to the Director-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition accepts those activities as proper activities of or <span class="highlight">powers</span> for an organisation, and I think it is as well to remember that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, the Opposition is accepting in principle the fact that these warrants and <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be available and exercised and that they ought to be exercised for reasonable periods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third pre-condition is that the Director-General himself, exercising presumably these emergency <span class="highlight">powers</span>, has not, within the preceding period of three months, issued a substantially similar warrant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second example of these constraints already being embodied in the Bill is the requirement in clause 28 that a warrant actually be issued physically by the Director-General before the <span class="highlight">powers</span> can be exercised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the kind of constraint which we regard as a minor practical price to pay for the maintenance of this quite crucial principle to which I now return: When we are exercising <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this sweeping, Draconic and potentially privacy-invading kind- we have spoken about them at length before- we have to be sure that if they are not to be exercised on the authority of a judge, which many people regard as the desirable way of doing things, at least they are exercised by an elected Minister of the Crown who is directly and personally accountable to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for those reasons that we urge that the Government accept this amendment and modify these emergency <span class="highlight">powers</span> accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say that on this matter I share a very large part ofthe concern that  Senator Evans  has expressed about investing an official, including the Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, with <span class="highlight">powers</span> to undertake the issuing of a warrant in emergency circumstances for a period not in excess of 48 hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The specific guidelines announced last October were directed to a situation which was then occurring, but it was made clear that the specific application of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the responsibilities of the Commonwealth Government may change from time to time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia itself where, without adequate supervision and checks and balances of this kind, quite serious instances of abuse of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of an intelligence organisation have been found by, for example,  Mr Justice  Hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee is dealing with a clause relating to warrants issued by the Minister on application from the Director-General in relation to the special <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have already debated earlier Opposition amendments which sought to intrude the Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Wriedt)  into all details of these special <span class="highlight">powers</span> for the granting of warrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will be given a briefing by the Director-General as to the way in which the Organisation is exercising its special <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-With respect,  Mr Minister,  I am not sure that it does, lt might be an extreme or an isolated occasion, but nonetheless it would appear to be possible under the <span class="highlight">powers</span> vested in the agency in clause 17 to communicate intelligence for purposes relevant to security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that that is misreading the <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General is given other very strong <span class="highlight">powers</span> in this legislation, particularly in approving the issuing of warrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this legislation the Attorney-General may not in many cases be the Minister exercising the power, although normally he would be; but those <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Attorney-General under this legislation have not been challenged in this Committee debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Kampuchea, is suffering from its geography, its long history and the politics not only of its people but also of the great <span class="highlight">powers</span> around it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ) That, subject to the resolutions hereunder with respect to off-shore mining and fisheries, the territorial sea should be the responsibility of the States and that for this purpose the limits or <span class="highlight">powers</span> of each State should be extended to embrace the territorial sea adjacent to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth’s constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> with respect to navigation and shipping arc acknowledged and no joint authority is contemplated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of each State should be extended to embrace the territorial sea adjacent to it and that there should be a joint Commonwealth/ State authority for offshore mining of petroleum and other minerals beyond State limits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I read the report, the view was that the granting of <span class="highlight">powers</span> and of proprietorial rights to the States was a bit dicky. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the States be extended to the territorial sea by the use ofSection 51 (38) to confer sovereignty upon each State in respect of the territorial sea and seabed adjacent to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The thing that puzzles us- at least I was under this impression- is that the Commonwealth made it clear that this transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the States was to apply only up to the three-mile limit with some joint control over off-shore mining in other areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statements that  Senator Wriedt  quoted from the Prime Minister or from other people, including myself, I would have thought, were a fairly clear indication of the understanding by the Commonwealth Government of what its <span class="highlight">powers</span> are and what its responsibilities are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure the Senate that the Commonwealth Government is very conscious of what its legal <span class="highlight">powers</span> are and what its responsibilities are in these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision of the last Premiers Conference was that the conflict would be resolved by legislative means within the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this Parliament and State parliaments and would not be attempted to be resolved by referendums or by resort to the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the way we are proceeding within the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The opportunity is also being taken to make a number of technical amendments to some provisions in Part II of the Act which relate to the procedures, <span class="highlight">powers</span> and operations of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of the Bill are designed to provide power for the Commission to issue public securities and to provide guarantee <span class="highlight">powers</span> thereto. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to borrowings by the Commission the amendments, which are in line with borrowing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of other Commonwealth authorities, provide that the Commission may borrow moneys from the Commonwealth or elsewhere and may give security and issue securities in respect of borrowings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to amendments to the borrowing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission which, as mentioned earlier, are contained in clause 6 of the Bill, that clause also makes technical amendments to a number of financial provisions of the existing Act concerning payment to the Commission of moneys appropriated by Parliament, use of bank accounts, application of moneys by the Commission, preparation of estimates, keeping of accounts and audit of accounts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This could, of course, apply to information passed to a police force of a State concerning a person who may be engaged, or is likely to be engaged, in subversive or terrorist activity, sabotage, espionage or anything else which comes within the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Organization. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think, from the points that  Senator Mulvihill  has made, he is concerned that any action of that kind would be in the performance of any <span class="highlight">powers</span> or functions under the Migration Act, the Citizenship Act or the Passport Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>“(2) The Ombudsman shall have the <span class="highlight">powers</span> specified in Section 9(1) and Section 14(1) of the Ombudsman Act 1 976 to determine whether such an adverse or qualified security assessment exists amongst the records of an agency of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is provided here is that the Auditor-General shall inspect and audit all the accounts of ASIO; that he shall report upon his inspection and audit to the Minister; that in exercising those <span class="highlight">powers</span> and inspection and report, he shall have whatever necessary <span class="highlight">powers</span> of access and inspection as are appropriate to enable him to exercise his function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Opposition’s amendment provides for the report to include details of all warrants taken out under the special <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Security Intelligence <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Organisation and under the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An even more basic matter of principle is that, I think, the Parliament, the Senate on this occasion, is giving up its <span class="highlight">powers</span> of total government supervision of individuals to a secret organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we believe that if the Parliament is to give up those <span class="highlight">powers</span>, it is entitled to receive a general report on statistics which this Opposition amendment requires. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is of course no likelihood that the Parliament, once it passes this very important and powerful piece of legislation, will continue to have any real <span class="highlight">powers</span> to scrutinise the way in which those <span class="highlight">powers</span> will work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are extremely wide <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me proper that there should be an opportunity of seeing how these new <span class="highlight">powers</span> will operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be some certainty that after a period these very new and untried <span class="highlight">powers</span> will be looked at. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would need to see how the <span class="highlight">powers</span> had been used and whether further amendments were needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of times during the debate honourable senators have heard argument as to whether there should be explicit statutory guidance on how the Attorney-General’s mind should be focused in the exercise of the various directions, discretions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> vested in him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They relate to the special <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are to be exercised in relation to the installation of listening devices, search and seizure, the interception of mail and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was going to hand over <span class="highlight">powers</span>, and so on, to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the aim of our policies is to give the States more clearly identified <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to test that, I put a question on notice last November- six months ago- in which I asked each Minister to identify those areas under his responsibility in which <span class="highlight">powers</span> had been transferred to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Northern Territory Legislative Assembly has been most fortunate in that, within a year of the transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> from the Federal Government, the Queen and the Federal Government have seen fit to make such a presentation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there anything that Australia and other democratic <span class="highlight">powers</span> can do to prevent this subversion of international organisations by the Soviet Union? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister oppose any transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Queensland Government if its interpretation, as  Senator Martin  suggested, is the outer reef? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accord with that decision, a three-member committee of review will be appointed to consider and report to the Government on the services, policies and performance of the Commission under its present statutory charter, and recommend appropriate future objectives, functions, statutory <span class="highlight">powers</span> and policies of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having regard to the statutory <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions of the ABC as set out in Broadcasting and Television Act 1942, the committee of review shall examine and report on the services, policies and performances of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The committee shall examine and make recommendations on the appropriate future objectives, functions, statutory <span class="highlight">powers</span> and policies of the Commission, with particular reference to its provision of national, State and regional services, having regard to the extent of likely available resources, reports relevant to the field of broadcasting and the services provided by public and commercial broadcasters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the Bill is to water down even further the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Prices Justification Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1976 the Government introduced amendments to the Prices Justification Act which significantly reduced the Tribunal’s <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at a couple of other factors concerned with the Government’s administration of the Prices Justification Tribunal over the last three and a half years, we see that there is a consistent administrative pattern, as well as a legislative campaign, aimed at reducing the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and effectiveness of the Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that as time goes by there will be integration of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Prices Justification Tribunal, and of the wider areas of the Commonwealth Trade Practices Act in relation to consumer protection, and those laws, including the prices laws, which apply in the various States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Rocher  asked a question only yesterday about the integration of the consumer protection <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the States and the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to reduce the Prices Justification Tribunal, to strip it of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> as an independent statutory authority, and to make it subservient to the government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, we propose that in Schedule II there be added exclusive <span class="highlight">powers</span> for the local assembly over referenda, electoral law, the recruitment and management of a Norfolk Island public service and education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One Schedule to the Bill sets out certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are appropriate in the view of the Government to be administered by the island assembly and the Administrator and another sets out certain other <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are enumerated in the two Schedules to which I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our submission, these should be expanded by including <span class="highlight">powers</span> over land use and zoning, mining, public hospitals and health, conservation and national parks, law enforcement and management of historic sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of those <span class="highlight">powers</span> which I have enumerated and which appear in Schedule III are the sorts of <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are appropriately exercised, for example, by a county government in England. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I say, they are <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to conservation and national parks, law enforcement and management of historic sites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a restriction which we regard as absolutely reasonable in the interests of efficient government and one which we regard as reasonable in relation to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions of the assembly itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, we suggest that we should place <span class="highlight">powers</span> on appointing members of the executive council and terminating appointments- I am referring to both <span class="highlight">powers</span> of appointing and terminating appointmentsalthough we are opposed to the concept of an executive council as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We think that insofar as the <span class="highlight">powers</span> exist in the Bill, and to which I have referred, the matter of accepting resignations of assembly presidents and deputy presidents should be placed in the hands of the assembly rather than of the Administrator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, we think that there should be a procedural change which would again affect the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the people in the assembly in that there should be a right of appeal to the assembly when an Administrator rules that an ordinance is beyond power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Administrator as contained in the Bill introduced by the Government are in a sense quite arbitrary and autocratic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Administrator as proposed in the Bill be reduced by- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Governor-General as proposed in the Bill be reduced by- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Legislative Assembly as proposed in the Bill be expanded by vesting in the Legislative Assembly the sole power of appointing members of the Executive Council and terminating their appointment, in the event of there being an Executive Council; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The key things to appreciate about the constitutional system which is created by this Bill are as follows: First of all, it confers minimal <span class="highlight">powers</span> on the elected Legislative Assembly; secondly, it confers negligible <span class="highlight">powers</span> on the appointed Executive Council; thirdly, it gives quite excessive <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Australian Government appointed administrator; and, fourthly, it enables the retention by the Australian Government, acting through the Governor-General, as the Bill puts it, of quite excessive residual <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the Administrator can exercise under this legislation would not be such as to embarrass an oriental potentate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The literal <span class="highlight">powers</span> vested in the Adminsitrator are very extensive- <span class="highlight">powers</span> to convene the Legislative Assembly, to initiate money legislation, to appoint and dismiss the Executive Council and to assent or refuse assent, as the case may be, to legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be said, of course, that these are merely literal statutory <span class="highlight">powers</span> and that they will not be misused; and that the conventions appropriate to a Westminster system will apply, just as was said in the run-up to the events of 1975 about the literal <span class="highlight">powers</span> vested in the Governor-General under the literal terms of the Australian Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, we cannot make any assumptions to this effect, given the absolute and dictatorial way in which the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Norfolk Island Administrator have been used and abused in practice in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He may also, for example, recommend amendments to the Administrator in subsequent sub-clauses of clause 23 there are similar provisions relating to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Governor-General in relation to laws made by the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions as they stand confer quite extraordinary <span class="highlight">powers</span> on the Governor-General to act quite unilaterally and, without any reference to the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly, to make an ordinance imposing taxes and authorising expenditure for the island community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition takes the view that for power of this kind to be vested in the Governor-General and not be subject to any sanction, any power, any intervention or any redress, if the islanders are unhappy about it, by the elected Legislative Assembly, is to make absolute nonsense of the supposed scheme of the Bill which vests primary money <span class="highlight">powers</span> in respect to activities on the island in that Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, this indicates how unequal this Government applies laws and its legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is to be done not at the rate at which the mining companies pay their royalties but at a rate higher than any other taxing <span class="highlight">powers</span> held by the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I attach for your information a letter I have sent to the Premier of Queensland proposing that Commonwealth and State officials hold discussions to resolve any possible difficulties which could arise in relation to the GBRMP following the Premier’s Conference agreements on extending the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the States into the territorial sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As you know it is planned that the follow-up arrangements on extending the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the States into the territorial sea be settled in time for ratification at the next Premiers’ Conference, and it is important to ensure that any GBRMP issues which bear on these arrangements are resolved between Ministers in consultation with myself in sufficient time to allow that timetable to be met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This payment will relieve the Commonwealth Government of meeting its obligations won at the referendum which gave it these <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that United Nations sanctions have been ignored almost entirely by the major <span class="highlight">powers</span>, will the Minister ask the Foreign Minister to initiate moves in the United Nations to have these sanctions lifted, as they represent little more than a joke? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That shows that the Government’s promise to maintain the purchasing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of pensions has been maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While it is not unusual for one of the Metropolitan <span class="highlight">Powers</span> to bc singled out for criticism at these conferences it appeared that on this occasion criticism was to bc directed towards the United States- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the 1 976 Defence White Paper it was stated that given the enormous risks from military conflict, on all rational considerations the restraints on the use of force between the two super <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the framework of their co-operation should endure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is, of course, nothing effective we could do directly in the event of a nuclear war between the super <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What would happen in a war between Australia and a regional neighbour in which the great <span class="highlight">powers</span> were not directly involved? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what happens if part or all of the island chain to our north is in hostile hands and is held by a government which is a client of one of the major communist <span class="highlight">powers</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  will know that the new Bureau has been armed generally with punitive <span class="highlight">powers</span> to which the Opposition objected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>which repealed section 125 of the Principal Act and inserted new sections concerning the functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Bureau. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 17 May these views were aired at a meeting between the Commonwealth and the State Ministers dealing with the transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> over areas of the reef to the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is so, then the Commonwealth Government has already moved a long way towards suggesting a transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will use whatever actions and whatever of its constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> are necessary to achieve the objective of preserving the Great Barrier Reef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government fully understands that it has the full constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will use whatever constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> are necessary to achieve its objective- the total protection of the Great Barrier Reef and the ecosystem and the establishment of the park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make this point clear: It may well be that the Government in resolving this matter will use its full constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every discussion with the State Government is on the understanding that we are discussing the matter within the full constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may very well be that the Commonwealth Government will find it necessary to use its full <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will make all those decisions, I repeat, with the full knowledge that it has the <span class="highlight">powers</span> to do so and with full emphasis on those. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It acknowledges that it has the <span class="highlight">powers</span>, it acknowledges that they are there for it to use and it acknowledges that it may use them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security recommended that ASIO’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> of interception should be extended to interception of information passing over all telecommunications systems and this Bill so provides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its purpose is to specify the existing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Wheat Board to raise moneys by the issue of approved securities and to empower the Minister for Primary Industry to provide a Commonwealth guarantee of repayment in connection with those securities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principles embodied in this Bill are designed to specify the existing general <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Board to borrow commercially to take advantage of types of money market facilities presently available to a body such as the Wheat Board for the raising of moneys. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I am suggesting is that now the war is over we should be endeavouring to assist Vietnam to wrench itself free from dependence on two major <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final matter that I wish to raise involves what I call the misuse of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs officers to seize and imprison people who perhaps have overstayed their visas or who are here illegally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have gone from the general Cases about which I spoke before to these specific cases- the misuse of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of immigration officials and the taking away of the freedom of those people who in some way may have misused their entitlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They concerned the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the immigration officers and the manner in which we deal with situations of this kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the Constitution the Commonwealth has no <span class="highlight">powers</span> to fix and to enforce price controls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clearly, both the situation in the Indian Ocean region and the general international political climate will be important factors in any agreement between the two super <span class="highlight">powers</span> to resume talks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would welcome the resumption of talks by the super <span class="highlight">powers</span> to this end were the situation in the region to permit this to take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reason why the Capricornia Park has not been declared is that the Government wishes to finalise the question or agreement on extending the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the States and the territorial sea with the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We recognised our pre-eminent constitutional responsibility and <span class="highlight">powers</span> and said that we would act accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The article then drew attention to what has been a very long standing problem in this country- the propensity of the judiciary to usurp the political legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is desirable that the declaration of the Marine Park should await the outcome of discussions with Queensland which flow from the 1978 Premiers’ Conference agreement that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the States be extended to the territorial sea, including the sea bed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Discussions with Queensland on the interrelated questions of the Premiers Conference agreements on the extension of State <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the territorial seas and the management of the Great Barrier Reef region are at an advanced stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the present time the Federal Government is giving <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the State which enable it to reduce the importance of the area, to denigrate the whole concept of protection of the Great Barrier Reef and so allow for its exploitation for minerals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ministers in relation to the respective jurisdictions that would be exercised between Queensland and the Commonwealth Government in the light of the general discussions that have taken place with the States as to the exercise of State <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the territorial seas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate must be familar with the fact that, under the Constitution, in most cases there are concurrent <span class="highlight">powers</span> between the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the States can exercise <span class="highlight">powers</span> even though the Commonwealth Parliament has <span class="highlight">powers</span> in those areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To fight this trade and fight it within a democratic framework and within the rule of the law the Government needs special <span class="highlight">powers</span>; <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are not normally granted to law enforcement generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government has not only been concerned with law enforcement <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition to completing the natural armoury of offences in this area, the inclusion of this particular offence will significantly improve the investigatory <span class="highlight">powers</span> relating to narcotics offences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As she herself pointed out, the people indicated that they did not want selfgovernment and did not want an Assembly with executive <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I pointed out that the people of this Territory have clearly expressed the view that the Assembly should not exercise executive <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can only presume that the granting of this power was included in the legislation when it was enacted because at that time it was expected that the Assembly might at some time in the future have executive <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this situation it is clear that the Minister, given his responsibility, has acted not only properly but also in accord with the wishes of the people of this Territory and with the wishes expressed so clearly in the referendum in 1978 and appropriately in terms of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Prime Minister has failed to answer my question on notice dealing with the transfer of functions to the States, it becomes clearer and clearer that this Government, in spite of its protestations of support for States’ rights, is possessed with the desire to hold onto the <span class="highlight">powers</span> it has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Basically, the present legislation is not clear, lt does no great credit to the Government to put forward legislation which gives no clear indications to the Director of the Kakadu National Park about, for example, responsibility and <span class="highlight">powers</span> he has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While this inquiry into the development and preparation for the orderly control and development of mining of uranium was taking place, there were constitutional changes being planned in the Northern Territory which involved the giving of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the transfer of <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the development of the National Park, honourable senators can well imagine that many people in the Territory are interested in seeing that they have a say in their own National Park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What can the Government do under the range of <span class="highlight">powers</span> available to it, perhaps under the postal or interstate trade and commerce <span class="highlight">powers</span>, to prevent the dissemination by advertising or interview of these sorts of remarks or schemes so subversive of the national revenue and the community’s sense of fairness? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that notwithstanding the legal advice which has been given to us through  Senator Walsh,  I think there would be room certainly for some argument about the <span class="highlight">powers</span> there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We would like to see a sensible division of <span class="highlight">powers</span>, because of the changing circumstances in which the Australian Atomic Energy Commission now operates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we came to implement the arrangement we discovered that the Atomic Energy Commission lacked the legal <span class="highlight">powers</span> to carry it out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did not consider the morrow at all and it did not consider whether the Atomic Energy Commission had the legal <span class="highlight">powers</span> or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Other <span class="highlight">powers</span> have been given under the Atomic Energy Act to give effect to the agreements that had been entered into. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any question of altering the <span class="highlight">powers</span> or structure of the Atomic Energy Commission will be considered by the Government when it has received that report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, their view ignores the very important role that Yugoslavia is playing in developing the bridges between the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In many senses  Senator Wright  was a distinguished contributor to debates on this question and the question of leaving <span class="highlight">powers</span> which should properly be prescribed by legislation to prescription by regulation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What department will be able to remain fearlessly independent if it gives advice to a government knowing that the Prime Minister of the day or the Minister of the day could direct his <span class="highlight">powers</span> against that department under the provisions of clause 7 ( 1 ) (a) (iii)? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clauses 9 and 1 5 purport to provide a system of appeals for those whose jobs are placed on the line by the redeployment and sacking <span class="highlight">powers</span> contained in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is claimed by the Government that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of redeployment and dismissal are already set out in the Public Service Act and that this Bill is doing nothing more than that which is already in the statute book. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason the Government has created the new mechanism, the new procedures in this Bill, is that it now wants to use the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which have grown rusty with disuse over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The existing Public Service <span class="highlight">powers</span> are clumsy and blunt instruments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new <span class="highlight">powers</span> contained in this legislation are much more refined and sophisticated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Putting it simply, the question is whether or not the Government gathers to itself the <span class="highlight">powers</span> to dismiss people for reasons which are not stated in the Bill, without allowing its actions to be subject to the scrutiny of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill does not seek new or extended <span class="highlight">powers</span> for the police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Knight  also expressed some concern about the regulatory <span class="highlight">powers</span> provided under the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is sought to be accomplished by this new sub-paragraph ( 1) (a) is to write in between, as it were, those two existing <span class="highlight">powers</span> vested in the permanent head, a further explicit power in the permanent head actually to make the finding that there is an excess, a surplus, an overmanning in that department by reference to the criteria or the procedures which have been laid down by the Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the conferring in the Minister of more extensive <span class="highlight">powers</span> of direction of the Commissioner, subject to the requirement that any such directions be tabled in Parliament and gazetted; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a system for the independent determination of complaints against police in accordance with the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission; and this Senate is of the opinion that any reintroduction of this Bill should be accompanied by the introduction of a Criminal Investigation Bill, specifying the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and duties of Federal police officers, in accordance with the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me of fundamental importance, with the Westminster style of government which we have in Australia, that the separation of <span class="highlight">powers</span> is the best safeguard of the individual’s liberty; that is, the more we can devolve power throughout the administrative structure within our country and the executive arm of government, the more likely it is that the interests and the liberties of individual Australians will be safeguarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an example of that matter I refer to section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act which specifically limits the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commissioner of Taxation to directing that information which comes into his hands can be directed only to certain bodies as set out specifically in that legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Especially, concerns were expressed about the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that this force might exercise and, in particular, there was reference to the sorts of things  Senator Messner  was talking about in his contribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It further undertook to legislate so as to produce and provide a proper code of conduct setting out in detail, and on a carefully reconsidered basis, what the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and duties should be of the various members of the new police force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nonetheless, I think it would not be inaccurate or unfair to say that that report was warmly received very widely both within Australia and overseas, within the profession and outside it, and regarded as essentially a sound and balanced contribution to law reform in this area and one which did produce sane, balanced and acceptable solutions to those very difficult problems relating to <span class="highlight">powers</span> of arrest, interrogation, search and seizure, electronic surveillance, questioning, custodial investigation and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matters of a code of conduct and behaviour, and of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and duties of the police force, as well as procedures for the investigation of complaints against police officers, were not entirely dead and buried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first such area of concern is the absence of any serious recognition by the Government of the necessity to do something about this problem of the definition of police <span class="highlight">powers</span> and duties as a necessary corollary of the creation of the new and more sophisticated police force; the kind of recognition which the Labor Government in 1975 so amply demonstrated; and the result of which concern was so well embodied in the report of the Australian Law Reform Commission on criminal investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that it is crucially important, if this Government is to maintain confidence in the integrity of the new force that it is creating in a climate, nationwide, where the integrity of all police forces is regrettably very much in issue, it must demonstrate its bona fides by addressing itself to this admittedly difficult but very important question of the enactment of criminal investigation legislation setting out a proper, balanced code of police <span class="highlight">powers</span> and duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, perhaps even more than the matter of criminal investigation Bills or those sorts of <span class="highlight">powers</span>, the enactment of provisions of this kind is crucial to the public acceptance of this new legislation and the new force that it will create. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only other point I wish to make involves the division of <span class="highlight">powers</span> between the elected government and the monarch of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fourth point is that the Opposition is concerned to confer on the Minister more extensive <span class="highlight">powers</span> of direction of the Commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill does not propose an extension of police <span class="highlight">powers</span> in any way whereas police <span class="highlight">powers</span> were extended in the 1975 legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were extended by the addition of the Customs <span class="highlight">powers</span> which would have been involved in the formation of that force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation must provide the <span class="highlight">powers</span> to enable these mechanisms to be used effectively- to prevent entry, to enforce departure when necessary and to impose adequate penalties to deter would-be offenders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My advice is and the Government’s view is that as the Bill is not creating or extending new police <span class="highlight">powers</span>, it preserves the status quo of the present two police forces in this matter, and that is the way it should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further, the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory agreed in October 1978 that the Minister for National Development should delegate all his <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act in respect of the areas adjacent to the Northern Territory and to the Ashmore and Carrier Islands to the Northern Territory Minister for Mines and Energy, subject to an agreement for consultation in accordance with the principles generally agreed at the Premiers’ Conferences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That provisions relating to the membership, <span class="highlight">powers</span> and proceedings of the Committee be contained in a subsequent resolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That provisions relating to membership, <span class="highlight">powers</span> and proceedings of the Committee be contained in a subsequent resolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I detain the Committee further only to say that the distinction which lies behind the Opposition’s amendment, suggesting that it might be appropriate for these <span class="highlight">powers</span> to apply in respect of certain kinds of offences but not others, is not simply a product of our own preference but is one that has the full support of the Australian Law Reform Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators should remember, and indeed  Senator Puplick  should remember since he quoted the passage, at page 107 of the criminal investigation report the Commission said that these <span class="highlight">powers</span> to issue warrants should be available only in respect of very serious offences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there are a number of reasons why we believe that if the Opposition amendment were adhered to it would severely detract from and inhibit the value of this proposed amendment and extension of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Narcotics Bureau in the investigation and pursuit of the major importers and distributors of narcotic substances in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Later in that speech  Senator Carrick  referred to the fact that the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security commended that ASIO’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> of interception should be extended to interception of information passing over all telecommunications systems and this Bill so provides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Telecommunications (Interception) Bill relates to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of at least two senior officers of the Commonwealth, the DirectorGeneral of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Comptroller-General of Customs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very lengthy debate which took place, before Parliament rose for the recess, concerning the Director-General of ASIO probably relieves us of the necessity to discuss in great detail at this second reading stage the <span class="highlight">powers</span> conferred upon him in regard to the interception of communications, and allows us to concentrate on the position as it relates to the ComptrollerGeneral of Customs and to narcotics offences in general. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is already evidence of the way in which some of those in the areas of surveillance in our country interpret their <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we talked about this matter in the earlier debate,  Senator Puplick  stated that clause 8 of the present Bill confers upon the Minister of the day general <span class="highlight">powers</span> to give directions to the Director-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, he pointed out that it limits his <span class="highlight">powers</span> to give directions in a number of specific ways, some of which we believe to be unacceptable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, if he is involved in activity which affects the security of the country or in an activity which is in some way associated with the development of large scale drug trafficking in this country- and of course this legislation to which we are asked to give our assent gives extra <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Comptroller-General of Customsthat would be a matter for the judgment of the Minister concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I personally support the concept of the Bill, particularly as it gives <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Narcotics Bureau to tap telephones and intercept telecommunications in certain circumstances and with certain safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not stop to canvass here the arguments which lie behind our whole approach to ASIO legislation and ASIO <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this or any other kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other main aspect of the legislation on which I think it is necessary to say a little more, albeit relatively briefly, at this second reading stage concerns the narcotics provisions and the brand new and completely unprecedented <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are now to be vested in the Customs officials in the Narcotic Bureau in respect of the enforcement of the Customs Act in the event of narcotics offences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New <span class="highlight">powers</span> to intercept telephone calls and other telecommunications are now vested in Customs narcotics officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have brand new unprecedented <span class="highlight">powers</span> for such officials to arrange for the interception of telegrams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May be that concern justifies new <span class="highlight">powers</span> being invested in our key narcotic law enforcement officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a situation where the cloud which is hanging over the head of the Bureau is quite unresolved; yet this Government, with breathtaking insensitivity, proposes to vest in officers of the Bureau who may well have been involved in the perpetration of some extraordinary criminal misbehaviour <span class="highlight">powers</span> the like of which are totally unprecedented in Australian legal and statutory experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Commission said very clearly- it is a matter of great regret that the Government has not listened to those recommendations- was that the exercise of such <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be safeguarded in various ways by being limited to very serious offences, which is not the case under this legislation, as will become clear when we speak to our first amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is said, again by the Law Reform Commission, that the exercise of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be limited to circumstances where other less draconian methods of law enforcement have been tried and failed or have proved impracticable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is further said by the Law Reform Commission that the warrant <span class="highlight">powers</span> in question should require that the warrants be issued in a form which states with great particularity the kind of electronic surveillance or intrusion that is authorised and not simply be warrants issued at large, as is the case under the legislation before us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lengthy debate has taken place in this chamber in relation to the package of legislation, including this Bill, regarding the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, but, insofar as the Bill extends the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of that Organisation to intercept telephone communications, the power is not a new one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such <span class="highlight">powers</span> have been exercised, I believe, in a responsible way over those years, without any real diminution of civil liberties in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of that power is in aid of the security of this country in the exercise of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that ASIO has to watch over threats to this country of subversion, espionage, sabotage and now, as extended by the ASIO legislation, in relation to terrorist activities which, of course, as we all know, are a growing threat in the modern world in which we live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security, which was presided over by  Mr Justice  Hope, by and large accepted those <span class="highlight">powers</span> and indeed recommended some additions to those <span class="highlight">powers</span> in other respects, such as listening devices, all of which have been dealt with in the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill which passed through the Senate some months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Justice  Hope recommended that as far as ASIO’s power is concerned, the legislation should be updated and expanded only to apply it to all modern forms of telecommunications, not limiting it as existing <span class="highlight">powers</span> are to communications over the telephone system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Government, as part of its policies in strengthening the fight against drug trafficking in this country, has decided that there should be enabling <span class="highlight">powers</span> for those investigating narcotics offences to extend those <span class="highlight">powers</span> also to interceptions of telecommunications or to messages on the telecommunications system as well as for the purpose of security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main effect and purpose of this Bill are not to expand the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the security organisation but to expand the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Narcotics Bureau in its investigation and prosecution of narcotics offences, that is, primarily the importation and disposal in this country of the great and vicious variety of drugs which we have been concerned with for some time and which are a threat to so many Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not pretend that these <span class="highlight">powers</span> are the answer to the drug problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the second reading speech in introducing that Bill in this chamber, I have referred to the same purposes that the Narcotics Bureau has in the extension of these <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the real purpose of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> proposed in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill as originally introduced into this Senate provided for those <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be exercised under a warrant by the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same situation has been the case since 1960 in regard to the exercise of such <span class="highlight">powers</span> by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The exercise of those <span class="highlight">powers</span> by the AttorneyGeneral probably followed as they have been exercised by him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been said in the debate in the House of Representatives on the Customs legislation, the House of Representatives favoured the view that the exercise of warrants authorising the use of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> for narcotics offences would be more appropriately carried out by a judge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, the Government is very pleased that the Parliament agrees with the Bill in that regard because the Government feels very firmly that the decisions in relation to the exercise of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> in matters of security are ones properly exercised by a member of the Government, particularly in the person of the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We take that view especially given the failure of the Government during the ASIO debate to accept any of the additional safeguards that we wanted to insert into the security system to ensure that the exercise of discretions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> by non-elected officials would be in accordance with democratic civil libertarian principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in that context that we reiterate our concern that <span class="highlight">powers</span> of any kind, particularly of this very far-reaching kind, ought to be vested in officials in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Admittedly it will be a new responsibility for the judges to exercise these <span class="highlight">powers</span>, but I really do not think that the judges of superior courts in Australia, Federal courts and State supreme courts, really need to have spelled out in this sort of detail in an Act of Parliament how they are to proceed in regard to these applications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if the Government continues to reject the notion of there being any kind of parliamentary reporting in relation to national security matters- a position which, regrettably, it made perfectly clear in the course of the debate on the ASIO legislation- will it please consider giving us proper parliamentary reporting of the use of warrants for electronic surveillance in the Customs area so that we as a Parliament, on behalf of the Australian community, can get some indication of how these <span class="highlight">powers</span> are being used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is not willing to provide this kind of information to the Parliament and to the community it can do nothing other than to create a suspicion- I fear an all too legitimate suspicion- in the minds of the community that it is misusing these <span class="highlight">powers</span> on a substantial scale and that it is anxious to conceal the scale of that misuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not normal practice because the <span class="highlight">powers</span> to tap telephones have been very limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Much can be achieved by Labor members  of State  parliaments in effectuating Labor’s aims of more effective <span class="highlight">powers</span> for the national parliament and for local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He went on to say that the Labor Party itself in Canberra was trying to reduce the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the people of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would always hold  Mr Dunstan  up to us, but now it is asking us to choose between its South Australian colleagues’ plea, decentralisation and the giving of decision-making <span class="highlight">powers</span> back to the States- in the words of  Mr Dunstan,  ‘let us give a fixed percentage of personal income tax to the States’and  Senator Wriedt’s  policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What did  Mr Dunstan  say in respect only of the taxing <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the then Labor Government would give without any widening of those <span class="highlight">powers</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The voluntary surrender of the offshore <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the States, the voluntary arrangement of <span class="highlight">powers</span> as between Commonwealth and States by the Federal Governent, is historic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The debate today is whether the people of South Australia want a return, to use  Mr Dunstan  ‘s words, to the highest taxes in the State’s history under Labor and  Senator Wriedt;  a return to a reduction in services-  Mr Dunstan  ‘s words- under  Senator Wriedt’s  policies; a return to the centralisation of <span class="highlight">powers</span>, also  Mr Dunstan  ‘s words; or whether they want a series of policies which have enabled the States to expand their services, balance their Budgets and reduce taxation, and which have given <span class="highlight">powers</span> back to the States and made the less populous States more sovereign and more capable of going about their business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill now provides for the amendment of the Quarantine Act 1908 principally to enable compensation to be paid when it is necessary to destroy certain goods or animals in order to prevent the introduction or spread of disease, and to give to quarantine officers <span class="highlight">powers</span> of entry and search in carrying out their duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 7 of the Bill extends the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of quarantine officers to include the power to inspect baggage which has come from an overseas vessel or aircraft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, this Government considers that as these actions affect property and the rights of individuals it is most desirable that where practicable the appropriate <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be set out in specific legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By providing compensation for innocent persons in the event of property loss through quarantine action and by widening the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of quarantine officers, the Bill will strengthen the capabilities of the quarantine service to protect this country from the ravages of dangerous exotic diseases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that in a de facto way we have enjoyed the <span class="highlight">powers</span> for some time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-As a member of the Standing Orders Committee, I support the proposition on the basis that the Estimates committees if they are dissatisfied with the adequacy of the information that has been given to them, they have sufficient <span class="highlight">powers</span> to say: ‘It is unsatisfactory and we will not complete the discussion of that particular item until the information is made available and given to us by an officer of standing who is acceptable to the Committee’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate has its own <span class="highlight">powers</span> in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">powers</span> that we have continue and they will continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Opposition says is that the circumstances of these allegations flying back and forth and in the circumstances of the need for all these inquiries to which I have referred, members of the Bureau of Customs and officers of the Narcotics Bureau should not be given the very extensive and draconian <span class="highlight">powers</span> which they are given by virtue of this legislation and the legislation which the Senate discussed last night relating to telecommunications interception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the existence of the respective inquiry, because of the doubts and allegations which are flying back and forth about the Narcotics Bureau, the police and so on and because of the very substantial penalties and methods of detection which are provided by this legislation, the Opposition says: ‘Should we not pause a moment to look at these various views before we rush on and give these <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the sort of men who, officially at least, are inexperienced in their use and perhaps inadequately trained in relation to these matters?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was making the point that the sorts of <span class="highlight">powers</span> which exist in this legislation should not be given to Customs officers until the police inquiry has reported and until some of these matters have been sorted out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to look at some of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the legislation about which we are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another point I make is that the Bill also seeks <span class="highlight">powers</span> not commonly accorded to law enforcement agencies to permit bugging. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, we say that it is very unwise legislation in the nature of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which it seeks to extend to Customs officers in the present circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 7 gives to servants of the Crown fairly extensive <span class="highlight">powers</span> of arrest without warrant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my sixth point, I believe that Federal <span class="highlight">powers</span> in this area must be sufficient to override State <span class="highlight">powers</span> so that the corruption that goes on in States such as New South Wales will not be used as an excuse to prevent effective enforcement of the narcotics laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That provisions relating to membership, <span class="highlight">powers</span> and proceedings of the Committee be contained in a subsequent resolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were talking about the impact of the Budget, percentages and spending <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He achieved this by calling on great reserves of diplomacy, <span class="highlight">powers</span> of command and a great sensitivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask you,  Mr President,  under the <span class="highlight">powers</span> given to you by the Senate- of approving or not approving the incorporation of these documents- to adopt the suggestion of  Senator Georges  that you make your decision only after careful consideration and discussion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise this point now especially since it has been proven that the technology available to many smaller <span class="highlight">powers</span> involves the use of so-called peaceful electricity power reactors which can be adapted to the making of nuclear weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For at this conference, the Commonwealth took on one of the most serious and sensitive issues in international affairs today, an issue which has resisted prolonged efforts made by major <span class="highlight">powers</span>, acting alone, to find a solution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much more importantly, in her speech of 3 August, she recognised the validity of the criticisms made of the present constitution, of the blocking <span class="highlight">powers</span> enjoyed by the white minority, and of the power vested in the various Service Commissions, which together make it impossible for the Government of Bishop Muzorewa to have adequate control over the country’s affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such <span class="highlight">powers</span>, which have not been included in any constitution resulting from a legal transference of power by Britain, deny Government <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are fundamental to a democracy- or indeed to any responsible Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think, as we look back now on the colonial expansion of the nineteenth century, that anybody could have had any doubt that in due course a conflict- very frequently a bloody conflict- would be the consequence of the colonialisation of Africa, Asia and Latin America by European <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am in favour of the reservation of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to a minority, not because I believe that if we were starting off in 1896 and constructing a new nation in Zimbabwe we would send out 200,000 Englishmen and say that they were to have some sort of veto right, however limited, within a constitution, but because I believe that if we have a situation in which there is a substantial number of people- although it is a small number it is a substantial number of people- who have all sorts of fears about their future, it is only fair and reasonable to expect that certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> and certain guarantees will be given to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is clear- I believe it should be clear to anybody- that if it had not been for the reservation of some <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the white electors within Zimbabwe there would have been no agreement at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only reason that Bishop Muzorewa was able to become the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe was that there was an agreement whereby the white population of Rhodesia- a group with which I have never had any identification; nor have I expressed any great admiration for it; nor indeed have I spoken of it in the past in this place, I would have thought, in other than condemnatory terms- agreed, for the sake of peace, to enter into a constitutional arrangement whereby it forfeited majority rule to the black population but retained certain <span class="highlight">powers</span> for the time being under a constitution which was subject to amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the whole debate that has been going on throughout the world about what has happened in Rhodesia is not an argument about the rights of the Crown and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Parliament of Southern Rhodesia as constituted in 1 965. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy of the Progressive Federal Party does not provide even for voting rights for all black adult citizens, lt provides for a restricted franchise; it provides for a situation whereby, under its plans for the proposed South African Senate, all the racial groups within South Africa- the blacks, the whites, the coloureds and the Asians- have a power of veto which is much greater than the limited <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the white minority in Zimbabwe has preserved in the Constitution under which its is now functioning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that we will find a situation there in which the still powerful white minority will surrender those small <span class="highlight">powers</span> which it still retains. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911 to enable certain of the Governor-General’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> under that Act to be delegated to the Treasurer, or a delegate of the Treasurer, so that new arrangements for marketing Commonwealth securities, as agreed to by the Loan Council, may be introduced later this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To allow for the flexibility required for dealing with these matters under the new arrangements, it is proposed that provision be made to enable the Governor-General to delegate his relevant <span class="highlight">powers</span>, and it is the essential purpose of this bill to amend the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to be emphasised that these amendments to existing legislation will, if passed, in no way reduce the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Parliament to authorise the borrowing of money by the issue and sale of stock, bonds or other securities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the States’ point of view the benefit of the arrangement is that their legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> are not eroded by an unrestricted exercise of the Commonwealth’s external affairs power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A new section 15 is substituted which provides broad enabling <span class="highlight">powers</span> under which standards of competence to be attained and other conditions to be satisfied in order to be ‘qualified’ for the purposes of the Act will be specified by regulation or by order under the regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Uniform Shipping Laws Code which I have mentioned extends to a wide range of matters besides qualifications and the Act contains <span class="highlight">powers</span> to enable legal effect to be given to those other sections of the Code. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is provision to ensure that, for reasons of safety of life and navigation, the provisions of the Navigation Act giving the Minister <span class="highlight">powers</span> regarding removal will still apply to any wreck, whether declared historic or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister is not to exercise any of those <span class="highlight">powers</span> unless it is necessary to do so for purposes of safety or environmental emergency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another provision ensures that his <span class="highlight">powers</span> to deal with oil pollution threats arising from damaged ships continue unrestricted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The substance of the latter was such as to exclude from the range of offences which could attract the operation of these new electronic surveillance warrant <span class="highlight">powers</span> all that related to less than trafficable quantities of the whole group of narcotic substances, including not only cannabis but also heroin, opium and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill and its associated Bill, the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill which was recently debated, represent for the first time in our history the giving by the Government to a law enforcement agency- in this case the Narcotics Bureau- of <span class="highlight">powers</span> of electronic surveillance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the tapping of telephones, the installation of listening devices, together with <span class="highlight">powers</span> over the interception of mail and telegrams and other forms of telecommunications, in respect of breaches of the criminal law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret that it has been all too familiar a phenomenon on our statute books for those <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be available with respect to national security matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation has long had <span class="highlight">powers</span> with respect to the tapping of telephones although not, of course, with respect to the installation of other forms of listening devices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the first time in our history as a nation that we have legislation vesting <span class="highlight">powers</span> in a law enforcement bureau of this extraordinarily sweeping and draconic kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most significant characteristic of this Bill before us is the way in which it vests these <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to electronic surveillance in Customs officers in the subject matter of narcotics offences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission has taken a great deal of evidence on what the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Federal Narcotics Bureau and of Customs officers with respect to drug offences ought to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If indeed  Mr Justice  Williams and his Royal Commission are prepared to endorse these <span class="highlight">powers</span>, these procedures, I for one would have wished to have seen a well-reasoned, argued case from that source in support thereof before having to debate legislation in the way that we are now obliged to, by the Government’s having brought it forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other matter that affects the timing of this, or any other, legislation which seeks to confer additional <span class="highlight">powers</span> on the Narcotics Bureau of the Commonwealth, a consideration that we must take into account, as I mentioned in the context of the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill, is the very large, black cloud which hovers over the Narcotics Bureau and its officers as a result of various matters that have come to light in recent months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We might be able to treat all of that with equanimity, satisfied- if we could be- that measures are in hand to investigate the allegations and to correct any misbehaviour that might be occurring there, were it not for the fact that we are now asked to vest in this agency, whose activities have been under such an extraordinary cloud in recent months, absolutely unprecendentedly diverse and extensive <span class="highlight">powers</span> of criminal investigation which will add enormously to its capacity, in the name of law enforcement, to intrude, snoop and pry on the activities of thousands, indeed millions, of ordinary Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can we be sure that the Bureau can be trusted to exercise these <span class="highlight">powers</span> with any kind of discretion, any kind of sensitivity, any kind of restraint, when we know what has emerged in the last few months about the kind of organisation that it is? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place a number of things can be said about the new <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are to be conferred upon Narcotics Bureau officers and Customs Bureau officers, in particular the power to employ electronic surveillance and the listening devices to which I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought to be appreciated that the Narcotics Bureau has hardly been without power of a very considerable kind in the past by virtue of the luxury it has enjoyed of almost total freedom from judicial or other scrutiny in its exercise of search and seizure <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the vesting in it of <span class="highlight">powers</span> with respect to electronic surveillance does represent a quantum jump, as it were, in the range and nature of its law enforcement power, it certainly is true to say that in the past Customs officers in general and narcotics officers in particular have had very wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the search and seizure area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Either form of warrant- both the general writ of assistance and the particular Customs warrant for a lesser period- empowers the bearer of such a warrant at any time of the day or night to enter into and search any house, premises or place, to break open the same and to search any chests, trunks or packages in which goods may be or are supposed  to  be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to those <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the general warrants, it is to be noted that there also exists under the Customs Act a whole series of specific <span class="highlight">powers</span> of search without warrant, particularly in what are known as behind the barrier customs situations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it a matter of regret that the piece of legislation before us today, hasty as it is to expand the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of Customs officers and narcotics agents in all sorts of ways which may or may not be defensible, makes no attempt to clean up what has long been a running sore in Australian jurisprudence- I would put it as high as that- and that is the existence of general warrants in the Customs legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that by a combination of limited judicially authorised warrants, plus certain very specific <span class="highlight">powers</span> of search without warrant and provisions for the obtaining of warrants in emergency situations by telephone or other means, Customs and narcotics officers can have all the <span class="highlight">powers</span> they need to enable them effectively to enforce this legislation without the possession of <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are in principle much too far reaching. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should have thought that the Government’s bona fides in bringing forward the present amending legislation would have been improved if it had been willing to consider, in the course of bringing forward this legislation, what have been very long-standing criticisms and objections to other <span class="highlight">powers</span> exercised by the officers in question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point that I am making- it is essentially a point in passing about the general warrant <span class="highlight">powers</span>- is that it seems that the Customs officers and the Narcotics Bureau have not been content with the very wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> of search and seizure that they have and that they want new ones. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus we have the electronics surveillance <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are before us today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition recognises, as it has to, the utility of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> with respect to telephone tapping, the installation of listening devices and the rest that are foreshadowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is also acknowledged by the Opposition that there has been an anomaly in the law to the extent that in a number of States <span class="highlight">powers</span> for the installation of listening devices are already vested in law enforcement authorities for the purposes of the criminal law and it has been possible and is possible in practice for narcotics officers to make use of those State <span class="highlight">powers</span> in particular law enforcement situations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To vest these <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the Bureau federally is, from that point of view, not a major sea-change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Acknowledging both of those points as we do, the Opposition does not go so far as to resist completely and absolutely the introduction of these new <span class="highlight">powers</span> in legislative form and the vesting of them in the agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we do say, however- I cannot repeat the point too often- is that the exercise of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> is very dangerous indeed because of the essentially exploratory, unselective, indiscriminate nature of the privacy intrusions that are necessarily involved in the use of electronic surveillance procedures of the kind that we are talking about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for that reason- because the scale of the eavesdropping, the intrusion on personal privacy, is exponentially greater once one starts using this kind of technology as distinct from old technology such as binoculars and listening under eaves- that one needs to hedge around the exercise of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> with a great many safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We regard it as bad that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> in question are to be available across the full sweep of offences under section 235. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition finds it almost impossible to believe that anyone would acknowledge seriously the legitimacy of using these kinds of law enforcement <span class="highlight">powers</span> at the bottom end of the scale; that is, with respect to drugs like cannabis or cannabis resin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only then that he can persuade the Opposition and the Australian people that he and the people who will succeed him in his job are serious about that commitment and that these <span class="highlight">powers</span> will not be used in a thoroughly unacceptable way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a whole series of amendments which the Opposition will be moving to that effect, to reduce the scope of the Bill so as to confine these draconic <span class="highlight">powers</span> to a narrower range of offences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So much as to <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only remaining matter which I desire to mention in relation to this Bill in explaining my and the Opposition’s objections to it relates to the absence of any serious provision relating to reporting to Parliament on how the Narcotics Bureau is performing generally, but more particularly on how it is exercising the sweeping new <span class="highlight">powers</span> which will be conferred upon it by this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These would not extend to disclosing the operational detail of the Bureau’s activities, requiring names, dates, places and so on to be spelt out in relation to the exercise of warrants, but nonetheless would make it possible for Parliament, and through it the community, to be informed of the scale on which those particular <span class="highlight">powers</span> were being exercised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill is designed to do three things: To expand the investigatory <span class="highlight">powers</span> of Customs officers, as has been outlined by previous speakers; to increase the penalties which may be imposed for certain kinds of offences; and to introduce a new type of penalty designed to exact more severe punishment on commercial traffickers than has been the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I presume that that is the base on which it is constructed and to that end, if it broadens investigatory <span class="highlight">powers</span>, even having listened to  Senator Evans’s  caveats, I think that it should be supported for the new <span class="highlight">powers</span> that it will give to the Bureau and for the new capacity it will provide to interrupt supply chains for some of the drugs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For drug trafficking the courts have tended to impose fairly modest gaol sentences although they have had available to them extensive <span class="highlight">powers</span> of imprisonment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The investigatory <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the Bureau needs must be made available to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill gives new <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Federal Narcotics Burea- <span class="highlight">powers</span> to institute electronic surveillance and to use listening devices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By means of administrative and financial support the Government has already stepped up the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of investigation which are so clearly needed as a response to the level of increase in drug trafficking which I have earlier described. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill provides for increased legal <span class="highlight">powers</span> further to improve methods of detection, and that is really the major purpose of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those two measures are expected to bring about, and I am sure will bring about, a very considerable improvement in the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and effectiveness of investigations of the Bureau of Narcotics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that in some States <span class="highlight">powers</span> already exist to use listening devices, but it is not satisfactory for the Narcotics Bureau, exercising on behalf of the Federal Government <span class="highlight">powers</span> of investigation and enforcement, to have to observe the laws in different States in relation to these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised that in the past year, acting within those <span class="highlight">powers</span>, drug enforcement officers have seized moneys and goods exceeding some millions of dollars in value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the existing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of seizure are very limited indeed and cannot be used to cope with the very elaborate washing devices these very sophisticated commercial operators are able to use, particularly with the expert advice they have at their disposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Australian Institute of Marine Science Act 1970 created the Institute and provided for the appointment of an interim council to recommend to the Minister the functions and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Institute in relation to marine science. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We all know that the State governments have no <span class="highlight">powers</span> to levy income tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that in a variety of ways the Labor Party wishes to remove the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the ways is to take away its financial <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have moved to a situation in which an independent tribunal has been given considerable <span class="highlight">powers</span> to act in and to protect the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Tribunal will be a ‘quasi-judicial’ body with <span class="highlight">powers</span> to hold public inquiries, into the grant and renewal of licences in the commercial and public sectors, as well as into such matters as the setting of standards of broadcasting practice, alleged breaches of licence conditions, or any aspect of broadcasting referred to it by the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1977 the Government took its next step and, in the Bill which passed through the Parliament that year, transferred the then ministerial <span class="highlight">powers</span> relating to the licensing of stations to the Tribunal and fully established the present <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Tribunal will have quasi-judicial <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(The Tribunal is aware that there might be constitutional limitations on the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of Parliament in this area, but such limitations would apply equally to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Tribunal itself. ) <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the increase in pharmaceuticals, the Government has foreshadowed the establishment of an independent inquiry, with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of a royal commission, to investigate and report on the efficiency and administration of hospitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was also announced in the Budget that the foreshadowed independent hospital inquiry would take place with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of a royal commission and it would investigate the kinds of things which some honourable senators have been advocating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the amendment is to exclude from the operation of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this legislation the installation of listening devices under warrants issued by judges for narcotic offences involving less than a trafficable quantity of cannabis or cannabis resin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also seeks to accommodate some views that were expressed in a debate on the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill, which contains similar <span class="highlight">powers</span> in respect of the interception of telephone calls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the debate on that Bill and, I think, in the debate when this amendment was moved on 28 August I indicated the Government’s view that there should not be any restriction of <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the way proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stated that we opposed it for practical reasons, namely, that law enforcement officers may wish to intercept telephone conversations taking place in various situations and their investigation would be restricted if they could not even seek such <span class="highlight">powers</span> unless they were able to establish that a trafficable quantity of a drug was involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the main purpose of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> is to help in the investigation of offences committed by the big commercial operators and the resources of the Narcotics Bureau are not likely to be diverted simply to investigating the smaller offences or smaller offenders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are here conferring <span class="highlight">powers</span> on judges of a particular status in the judicial system, namely, judges of the highest courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that there are jurisdictional distinctions between them in the exercise of their ordinary judicial <span class="highlight">powers</span>, but in this cass we are selecting them for the purpose of issuing warrants without regard to their jurisdictional limits, which are entrenched in our constitutional Federal system and historical reasons, which many people think ought to be changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are being given here do not arise from respective jurisdictions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said frequently in regard to these debates, the purpose of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> being conferred is to assist in investigations against the larger commercial operators in the drug trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would imagine that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are being given here to install listening devices, and to provide some reporting in regard to the way in which they operate, the results they have and so on would be matters under this proposed section on which the Leader of the Opposition would clearly want and be entitled to receive advice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the Government and my colleague in another place, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs  (Mr Fife),  would be delighted to be able to report in accordance with one of the honourable senator’s suggestions, namely, that these <span class="highlight">powers</span> had been used so successfully that the whole problem had gone away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But cutting back on the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and funding of the Prices Justification Tribunal and the Trade Practices Commission, unrestrained profitmaking becomes the order of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will recall that in 1973, during the period of the Labor Government, we recognised this problem and endeavoured, by referendum, to obtain those <span class="highlight">powers</span> for the Federal Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, the Australian people unfortunately refused the transfer of those <span class="highlight">powers</span> from the States to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have drawn attention to the very small number of cases that have been dealt with, and for anyone to give the impression that this provision will attract excessive litigation overlooks the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that I have described as to the way in which the Commissioner makes his determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat that, of the significant <span class="highlight">powers</span>, we were the first to offer substantial aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is probably deplorable that the major <span class="highlight">powers</span>, which in many cases are in a better position to bring pressure to bear, have not done what Australia has done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that most parliaments have adopted the policy of delegating to someone else <span class="highlight">powers</span> under legislation, but we have always reserved the right in the legislative machinery of this country to have supervision over the actions of that person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Obviously the British have extended the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of regulation more than we have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was hoped- indeed, expected by some of us- that the referendum on self-government would be decided in favour of self-government and that we could proceed to delegate <span class="highlight">powers</span> and devolve decision-making responsibilities to the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister representing the Minister for Transport seen reports in this morning’s Press, and in particular in the  Canberra Times,  that in the matter of  Mrs Deborah  Wardley counsel for Ansett Airlines of Australia told the Victorian Supreme Court yesterday that if Ansett was now forced to admit her to the November pilot training intake it would nevertheless proceed immediately to dismiss her forthwith under its <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the Airline Pilots’ Agreement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Much of the criticism levelled at those aspects of the Bill we examined, seemed to suggest that the legislation conferred <span class="highlight">powers</span> on the Archives that would allow for unnecessary encroachment upon the domain of other custodial institutions throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendments will require a Commissioner to consult with his  Deputy President  before making or varying an award relating to wages and conditions; prohibit the Commission from ordering, recommending or sanctioning in any way, an employer paying wages to an employee for time when the employee was engaged in industrial action; provide for the expeditious hearing of stand-down applications, either before a single member of the Commission or a Full Bench; provide that the question of whether an industrial dispute exists may be the subject of a reference to a Full Bench; enable an industrial dispute or part of an industrial dispute to be referred to a Full Bench at the conciliation stage; reinforce the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the  President  of the Commission by enabling him to withdraw a matter from another member of the Commission and either deal with it himself or refer the matter to a Full Bench; and provide increased protection for the community by creating an alternative path to the deregistration of organisations and thereby remove delays in the deregistration process in cases where the safety, health or welfare of the community are put at risk by industrial action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Powers</span> of the Commission in Relation to Payments to Workers for Time Lost through Industrial Action <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn next to the proposal to limit the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission in relation to payments to workers for time lost through industrial action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, in exercising <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the section, the Governor-General will act with the advice of the Executive Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliament should indicate that it would be much more happy to confer these <span class="highlight">powers</span> after proper appeal provisions are instituted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed section places no limits on the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of an authorised officer to make such an entry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has taken years to get <span class="highlight">powers</span> for the Commission, and the whole effort has now been torpedoed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the report states the problem and makes a recommendation for wider <span class="highlight">powers</span> relating to the quality of water it does not seem to suggest solutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also gives to quarantine officers proper <span class="highlight">powers</span> to inspect imported goods and to search premises when breaches of quarantine regulations are suspected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential that expert quarantine officers in this country have the <span class="highlight">powers</span> given to them in this legislation, <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are at present confined largely to the police and Customs officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They need these <span class="highlight">powers</span> if they are to protect this country by quarantine measures, as this country needs to be protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it seeks to give assistance to quarantine officers in the carrying out of their duty by giving them much wider <span class="highlight">powers</span> of entry and search. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill extends the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of quarantine officers to enable them to search baggage immediately, without refer*ence to Customs officers, and to go beyond the premises of the immediate port of entry to any place at which any material newly arrived from overseas may be found, with an appropriate, fair and reasonable warrant to inspect newly arrived material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With these new <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are given by the Bill there is an emphasis upon plant and animal quarantine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have relied upon the <span class="highlight">powers</span> given to Customs officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third major element of the Bill deals with appropriate <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be granted to quarantine officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It took quite a deal of evidence on the lack of adequate <span class="highlight">powers</span> by quarantine officers, a lack which was evidenced by the fact that for many years there were legal opinions- for example, I think one was given by a  Deputy  Crown Solicitor of one of the States, perhaps New South Wales- to the effect that after the granting of pratique- that is the granting by quarantine officers of permission to a vessel to unload passengers or goods because it is thought to be free of infection- quarantine officers lost any power to deal with goods discharged from a ship or aircraft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a gap that was brought up in evidence quite often before the Senate Committee on Natural Resources, as indeed was the whole question of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of quarantine officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is very welcome, and it goes quite a long way towards granting <span class="highlight">powers</span> to quarantine officers to enable them to enter premises either with the consent of the owner or with a warrant granted by a justice of the peace in order to carry out his functions of inspection where he reasonably suspects that some infected article is present in those premises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need for such <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be given to quarantine officers came up time and time again in the evidence received by the Senate Committee on National Resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not too early to have brought before the Parliament these sorts of clauses which help to establish the status and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of quarantine officers, as they ought to be persons who can operate independently of other agencies, whether of State or Federal character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate Standing Committee on National Resources did its job and studied the question, and all members favoured providing quarantine officers with additional <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be given to quarantine officers so that they can stand alongside Customs officers at every port of entry into Australia and when a person states on his card that he has been on a farm the quarantine officers should then have the right to look at his luggage, inspect it and fumigate his shoes, particularly in cases where passengers request to have their shoes fumigated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs has advised me that the Trade Practices Act does not prescribe the circumstances in which the Government’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> of intervention are to be exercised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ordinance creates a Controller of Fuels, provides for the appointment of inspectors, and confers special <span class="highlight">powers</span> on those officers to deal with shortages of fuel such as occurred last June. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee was concerned with provisions which allowed the Controller of Fuels to delegate his <span class="highlight">powers</span> to any person without limitation as to the class of persons to whom the delegation could be made, the service of notices by publication in a newspaper instead of the usual method of personal service, and wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> of entry and search of premises, even in the absence of a declaration under the Ordinance that an emergency exists in relation to fuel supplies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has agreed to restrict the delegation of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Controller of Fuels, to provide for personal service of notices, and to ensure that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of entry and search can be exercised only at reasonable hours during the period when a declaration of emergency is in force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee considers that such a provision is highly desirable in all legislation which confers compulsory information-gathering <span class="highlight">powers</span> upon specialist officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are confronted with extraordinary <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are to be given to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next important alternation which concerns the Opposition is proposed new section 25a in clause 4 of the Bill, which deals with the limitation of <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But sub-paragraph ( b ) states: at any time, or from time to time, within the period of 6 months, by order in writing, exercise any one or more of the following <span class="highlight">powers</span>: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am certain that in the days when  Senator Cavanagh, Senator Mulvihill, Senator Gietzelt  and I were union officials and we operated in the industrial area we would not have put up with talking to a commissioner or  chairman  of a conciliation board unless we knew that he had the <span class="highlight">powers</span> to settle a dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next provision is to extend the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the  President  to take over matters which are before another member of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions to which I have referred will remain, so the court will retain those <span class="highlight">powers</span> but similar <span class="highlight">powers</span> to act will be granted to the Executive after a Full Bench of the Commission has determined that industrial action by an organisation or a group of its members has had, is having or is likely to have, a substantially adverse effect on the safety, health and welfare of the community, or a part of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will enable an industrial dispute or part of an industrial dispute to be referred to a Full Bench at the conciliation stage and they will reinforce the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the  President  of the Commission by enabling him to withdraw a matter from another member of the Commission and either deal with it himself or refer the matter to a Full Bench. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 22 provides that where a member of the Commission has exercised <span class="highlight">powers</span> with respect to conciliation he shall not participate in an arbitration, if there is an objection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It happened with the amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act two years ago which savagely increased the scope of the penalties and the punitive <span class="highlight">powers</span> in that legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is it necessary to vest this vast range of additional <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the President? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is it necessary to do so in particular when one considers that in order for him to be able to exercise these <span class="highlight">powers</span> properly, he would need to be something of an industrial superman, not only physically in terms of the numbers of eyes, ears, arms and legs he would have to have in order to be able simultaneously even to begin to monitor the potential trouble spots round the nation within his jurisdiction, but also in terms of the discretion and the sensitivity that he would need to exercise in order to ensure that the personal jurisdiction that it is proposed to vest in him did not get completely out of hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">powers</span> are absolute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How apt it is for us to pause for just a moment longer in relation to the deregistration provision and note that it contains not only the ultimate sanction of deregistration but also it contains a series of other provisions which vest in the government of the day, once this preliminary easy threshold declaration has been made, a whole series of other <span class="highlight">powers</span> to do a variety of quite extraordinary things by way of the manipulation of the union’s property and the requirement that it not spend money on particular purposes- for example, particular publications or particular people’s salaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that it is strongly arguable that these <span class="highlight">powers</span>- both the threshhold declaration <span class="highlight">powers</span> by the Commission and the subsequent Executive level <span class="highlight">powers</span> by the Government- are, in fact, by their very character, <span class="highlight">powers</span> of a judicial nature and as such are unconstitutionally invested in non-judicial bodies as they are here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not designed to control a commissioner by limiting his discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span> in relation to prevention and settlement of disputes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Admittedly union <span class="highlight">powers</span> when exercised as they frequently are, in an arrogant way, are anti-social, yet severe repressive measures can succeed only if some very wily and wellthought out initial preparation of the ground is first resorted to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must remember in regard to this whole area that we have very limited <span class="highlight">powers</span> insofar as the Constitution is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know also that there is power in the High Court to ‘read down’ <span class="highlight">powers</span>, as happened in regard to the Family Law Act, so that they fit within the constitutional framework and so that they can operate without defeating the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> would have to be cut down quite considerably if the courts were to uphold this particular law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last thing I want to point out about this provision is that although it empowers the Government to make orders under clause 1 6 of the Bill, those orders are in no way subject to disallowance in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is most unfortunate that <span class="highlight">powers</span> are given to the Executive government in this way to make very drastic orders which are not to be subject in any way to the control of the Houses of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will vote for this Bill because the Government is of the opinion that it requires a number of these <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> are desirable but I think that the procedures under which the Bill has been presented are rather dubious and I think it is unfortunate that quite necessary repair <span class="highlight">powers</span> are mixed with others which are of dubious constitutionality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Government will look again at some of those <span class="highlight">powers</span> and, in the calmness of that consideration, will amend them, taking advice from those who are experienced in the jurisdiction, and will thereby not cause the type of offence and industrial trouble which might otherwise break out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an attempt to extend the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the  President  to intervene in particular cases - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the States were jealous of their <span class="highlight">powers</span> at that time and clearly did not want to hand them over to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make the point that at that time the Federal Parliament discussed very deeply the question of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> in this area that it ought to assume. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is perhaps an argument in favour of extending the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Federal Government and the Federal Parliament over industrial relations as they affect the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been talk about the reference of <span class="highlight">powers</span> to the Commonwealth for that purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the pressure grows in this system to perpetuate and justify itself, so will the <span class="highlight">powers</span> grow ruthlessly to overpower and subdue the accepted traditional patterns of industrial relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This state of affairs is the product of a Fraser dominated Executive which has usurped the rights and the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Parliament and is prepared to bludgeon through legislation such as this to patch up the Government’s decadent collapsing capitalist ethic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation has received unprecedented <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> of ASIO have been increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The legislation will require a commissioner to consult with his  deputy president  before making or varying an award relating to wages and conditions; prohibit the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission from ordering, recommending or sanctioning an employer paying wages to an employee for time when the employee was engaged in industrial action; provide for the expeditious hearing of a stand-down application, either before a single member of the Commission or a Full Bench; provide that the question of whether an industrial dispute exists may be the subject of a reference to a Full Bench; enable an industrial dispute or part of an industrial dispute to be referred to a Full Bench at the conciliation stage; reinforce the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the  President  of the Commission by enabling him to withdraw a matter from another member of the Commission and either deal with it himself or refer the matter to a Full Bench; and provide increased protection for the community by creating an alternative path to the deregistration of organisations in cases where the safety, health or welfare of the community are put at risk by industrial action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, all the proposals, except the one dealing with deregistration, are concerned with the manner in which the commissioners or  deputy  presidents go about exercising <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other matter is the question of new <span class="highlight">powers</span> and provisions in relation to the deregistration of unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By and large, they deal with the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of deregistration of the Federal Court and with applications to that court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are, and have been for many years, provisions in the Act by proclamation to give <span class="highlight">powers</span> of deregistration to the Full Bench of the Commission itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not until those facts have been established that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of deregistration can be exercised by the GovernorGeneral under this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is clearly a judicial process in which facts are determined, and it is only after the facts are determined in accordance with the legislation that these <span class="highlight">powers</span> can be exercised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the fact that in one case the court would be deregistering and in the other case the Governor-General would be doing so, and he has a discretion as to whether to do so, there is no fundamental difference really between the exercising of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of deregistration, except that the Government believes that in these cases the procedures will be able to be exercised more quickly, and for the greater protection of the community, than they can be exercised under the existing <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the generality of cases when applications for deregistration take a considerable time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only because of the urgency of the matter in the particular threat to the safety, health or welfare of the community that the Government is proposing these additional and more expeditious <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in my view, and certainly the view of my advisers, that they are within the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is regrettable, given the controversial character of the whole question of court administration under this Government, particularly with regard to High Court administration and the discussions to which that has given rise over the last year and, in that context, with regard to the decision, which has now apparently been taken by the Government, to vest independent <span class="highlight">powers</span> of administration in the High Court in that body of judges itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If transmit <span class="highlight">powers</span> of 20 watts were to be utilised, it is considered that it would be most difficult to obtain the agreement of administrations which might be expected to offer freedom from interference to earth station reception in Australia if the low power services employ the same nominal orbital positions as those assigned to Australia in the Plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, even though there has not been to my knowledge any instance of the actual use of those <span class="highlight">powers</span>, any more than there had been any use of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the Crimes Act which were repealed in 1973, nonetheless it would seem appropriate that the attention of the Government was turned to this matter and that some action was taken to amend accordingly the legislative provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) The Minister may, either generally or as otherwise provided by the instrument of delegation, by writing signed by him, delegate to an officer any of his <span class="highlight">powers</span> under this Act other than this power of delegation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer the Minister representing the Minister for National Development to the meeting of Ministers held in Melbourne on Monday of this week to consider amendments to the River Murray Agreement in order to update the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the River Murray Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even with this large expenditure of time and resources to the detriment of progress in other areas, agreement has been reached on a treaty which provides some limits on the growth of the arsenal available to the world’s super-<span class="highlight">powers</span>, but does nothing to reduce the quantity of those weapons- a process which is left to the negotiations of SALT III. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the comprehensive test ban treaty is being negotiated by the United States, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Great Britain, while the treaty on the prohibition of chemical weapons remains the province of the two super-<span class="highlight">powers</span>, the United States and the USSR. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding the new democratic structure of the Committee, the large <span class="highlight">powers</span> still retain substantial control over disarmament measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, it is likely that because the SALT II negotiations were in an advanced and critical stage early this year, both the super-<span class="highlight">powers</span> acted with restraint when confronted with the conflict between China and Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another advantage is that the long drawn out negotiations gave both of the super-<span class="highlight">powers</span> a much clearer understanding of the capacity and intentions of the other side, thus reducing the chance of a conflict based on a misconception of their respective intentions and capabilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real value in the SALT negotiations is the increase in trust which occurs between the two super-<span class="highlight">powers</span>, because I take the view that the success of any arms limitation measures depends upon the degree to which the level of trust between the nations is increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The major <span class="highlight">powers</span> practise secrecy about their nuclear arsenals and particularly about the number of tactical nuclear weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We could talk at great length about the rights and wrongs of those who claim that there is a lack of surveillance and proper supervision of each of the major <span class="highlight">powers</span> to this extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The most dangerous area for the world involves nuclear weapons, both the possession of these weapons by the super-<span class="highlight">powers</span> and the possibility of widespread proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The trouble is that the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is seriously defective, particularly because three nuclear <span class="highlight">powers</span>- France, China and India- are not signatories to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In order that this national commission will have the necessary <span class="highlight">powers</span> to administer that legislation in the States, each State is required under the agreement to pass legislation which complements this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The former Labor Government opted for unilateral action by the Commonwealth insofar as it proposed to legislate without consultation with the States and rely solely on the Commonwealth’s legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill establishes the National Commission and sets out its <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions, staffing, financing and other operational aspects such as meetings and hearings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Commission’s substantive <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions will be derived from Commonwealth and State companies and securities industry legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill allows the Commission to hold hearings in public or private in order to perform any of its functions or <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They deal with the constitution of the Council itself, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Tribunal and the Federal Court of Australia in relation to stay orders, and machinery matters relating to time limits and staff of the Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, experience has shown that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> available to the Tribunal under section 41 are not sufficiently flexible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under sub-section 44(6) of the existing legislation, the Court has <span class="highlight">powers</span> similar to those of the Tribunal to make suspension or stay orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clauses 8 and 9 have been included in the Bill to ensure that the Court’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> are parallel to the broader <span class="highlight">powers</span> which are to be conferred on the Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments will also ensure that the Court’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> extend to both the Tribunal’s decision and the original decision which the Tribunal was reviewing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Authority for this is contained in the Social Services Act and similar <span class="highlight">powers</span> exist in relation to all social security benefits; that is, a claimant must establish his eligibility for a particular benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The amendments to the Customs Act to expand the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of narcotics officers to use listening devices and the complementary amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act were based upon the argument from narcotics officers and others that these <span class="highlight">powers</span> were needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, since the authoritative High Court decision in Sankey v.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The findings could be summarised succinctly but, I think, accurately as follows: Firstly, despite what has been said by so many Government spokesmen, the Westminster system does not justify extensive limitations on the scope of freedom of information; secondly, many claims about the resource implications of freedom of information legislation have been undoubtedly greatly exaggerated, and the Public Service can and should be able to cope with legislation much less narrow than that which has so far been proposed; thirdly, the present Freedom of Information Bill allows much too much information to escape the net entirely, containing as it does too many unnecessarily restrictive exceptions and exemptions; fourthly, the Bill provides insufficient safeguards against administrative, procedural and financial obstruction of freedom of information requests- too many obstructive <span class="highlight">powers</span> rest with agencies; fifthly, the Bill does not impose sufficiently clear and precise guidelines for agencies to publish directories, indexes, manuals and guides on the operation of the legislation; and sixthly, the present review and appeal procedures are both too cumbersome and too limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Narcotics Bureau claims that the simple remedy for any deficiencies it may have is to increase its staff, <span class="highlight">powers</span> and resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a matter for a police force with police <span class="highlight">powers</span>, training and discipline, and possessing a range and breadth of resources that can be employed as needed in the fight against drug crimes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of great single importance was the extension of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and prerogatives of elected Community Councils, which as corporate bodies are now able to accept greater responsibilities for the conduct of their communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Queensland policy, which discourages ‘hand-out’ or ‘sitdown’ style assistance, encourages Council decision-making <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be matched by responsibility for the performance of the functions over which it exercises authority, to standards acceptable to the broad society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That indicates that, by removing the Tribunal’s effectiveness as a resource centre and by removing the <span class="highlight">powers</span> to investigate, it is left to the States to play some small but ineffective role in the whole area of prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was no way in which the Tribunal could possibly cope with that flood of material and perform an effective role as a prices justification body, particularly with the limited <span class="highlight">powers</span> it was given when the Labor Government established it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, the Labor Government soon discovered, even with its own prices justification <span class="highlight">powers</span>, when it introduced the body, that it had to direct the attention of that body to the need to generate new investment and to the need for maintaining company profitability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the first things that the present Government did when it came to office was to reduce the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Grants Commission by preventing it from dealing directly with local government throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We of the Opposition would restore the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not like to commit myself to a general statement regarding the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that the Commonwealth Parliament and the Government may have in relation to these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Obviously defence <span class="highlight">powers</span> and matters of that sort come to mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is one of the two super <span class="highlight">powers</span>, along with the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No country can avoid having relations with the super <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No country can be secure so long as it believes that there is any threat of any kind whatsoever from either of the two super <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However horrendous the events that are occurring in any of these smaller countries, the consequences of those events are in no way as important to the people of this country and to the people of the rest of the world as are the events which take place within the boundaries of the super <span class="highlight">powers</span>, nor are the policies of those countries in any way as important or as significant or as potentially dangerous as the practices and policies of the super <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is equally easy to see how, in the process, the Commissioner for Community Relations,  Mr Al  Grassby, will be stripped of all those <span class="highlight">powers</span> and responsibilities which have made him, over the last few years, such an effective voice for blacks and migrants in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that the Bill does nothing to actually change the law in any of areas such as police <span class="highlight">powers</span>, freedom of assembly, voting rights and all the rest of them, where civil rights are very obviously in need of specific legal protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Expanded <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions for the Commission, including effective means of enforcing its recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is that possibility to delegate <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions, including the function of receiving and dealing with particular kinds of complaints to a State agency or instrumentality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fourth general matter that I wish to raise about the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill is that  Mr Grassby  ‘s staff is to be transferred lock, stock and barrel to the new Commission, leaving him no <span class="highlight">powers</span> at all of hiring, firing or deployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fifth point is this: The <span class="highlight">powers</span> vested in the Commissioner for Community Relations by the 1 975 Act in relation to the appointment of local concilation committees and the central Community Relations Council-not that that has ever been established- are now stripped from him and vested in the Human Rights Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Expanded <span class="highlight">powers</span> and functions for the Commission, including effective means of enforcing its recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Grassby) to the Human Rights Commission while preserving only the Commissioner’s investigating and conciliatory <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those limited <span class="highlight">powers</span> which he retains are to be performed thereafter under the ‘directions’ of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a dangerous diminution of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission and Commissioner for Community Relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Delegation of <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 13 gives the Commission the sweeping authority to delegate ‘all or any’ of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> now to be exercised by it under the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, the Clause restricts the Commissioner for Community Relations from any delegation of his <span class="highlight">powers</span> except to a member of the Commission ‘s staff or any person the Commission approves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be noted that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> over racial discrimination now being transferred to the Commission are not ‘toothless’ but have been developed with limited facilities yet with overall success. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, the Commission’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> in all other human rights areas are to be severely restricted as I have demonstrated above. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">powers</span> are to be so variable, then the case for amalgamation is accordingly weakened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission should have the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and facilities to affect the purposes sought and be empowered to investigate the great majority of violations of human lights in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, to be able to look into that seems to me to be one of the objects that obviously should be within the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this particular Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must surely write into the Bill those provisions so that this bypassing cannot be done and the small <span class="highlight">powers</span> which the Commission has at the moment, cannot be eaten away by a State which wants to do the investigation itself and to cut out the Commission from its area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The weaker Commission will accumulate the greater <span class="highlight">powers</span> which, at the moment, the Racial Discrimination Commissioner has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Committee was highly critical of the amalgamation of the two operations and the taking away of  Dr Grassby  ‘s <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, I think, therefore very inauspicious that we should be considering changing and probably reducing the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and effectiveness of the operation of the Commissioner for Community Relations at this time when that challenge is about to be launched. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have defended for many years the concept that we ought to have a Human Rights Commission and that this is the right way to go, but only if such a Commission has within its <span class="highlight">powers</span> the ability to carry out a really genuine compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the proposed Human Rights Commission are very limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">powers</span> are limited to Commonwealth legislation only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need for an office of community relations to continue to exist without any deletion or any watering down of its <span class="highlight">powers</span> is greater now than it was five years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not the spirit of any of the legislation carried in either chamber of this Parliament, which conferred State-like <span class="highlight">powers</span> on the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So, if he has any influence, we would be delighted if he would exercise his <span class="highlight">powers</span> within the party to do something about the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such amendments need to relate to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Consultative Committees on Community Relations currently assisting in the administration of the Act throughout Australia; the outlawing of publishing and disseminating racist material; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we cut the wings of the Office and take away the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commissioner we will be back to the old law of the jungle whereby if someone is less than white he or she is less fairly treated than any other member of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One eminent jurist has advised the Commissioner that provisions of the Act, including certain prohibition provisions, cannot be supported by Commonwealth constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> since they are not directed to people of a specific race. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apart from the qualifications about the elections of parliament, the Bill of Rights is a statement about the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw attention to the statement made by the Premier of South Australia,  Mr Tonkin,  in his comments at the opening of Dartmouth Dam on Friday in which he highlighted the disadvantage suffered by South Australia because of the River Murray Commission’s lack of <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Lionel  Bowen, was recently reported to the effect of advocating the abolition of the Senate ‘s <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I read that there was a decision by the Australian Labor Party, including  Mr Hayden,  that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate, particularly its power over money and finance, should be removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is made especially important by the fact that the people involved have recently been given the power to conduct investigations into narcotics trafficking in this country and have had their <span class="highlight">powers</span> widened considerably by their incorporation into a much larger police force than existed before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 16 does not provide the Commission with enforcement <span class="highlight">powers</span> by way of legal action when all avenues of conciliation have failed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  remarked in his second reading speech that the Commission would not need enforcement <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the type vested in the courts and that sanctions of a legal kind ‘may even provide antagonism ‘-antagonism, mind you- ‘rather than a spirit of co-operation which is so central in matters of reciprocal rights and obligations’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not suggesting that Australia is any different from any other country, because I think what we have witnessed in recent times is this tremendous world movement towards human rights and against discrimination, and the struggle of the Third World countries to be recognised in the same way as other countries, the realisation that the superpowers should not have the sort of <span class="highlight">powers</span> that they have to make decisions over life and death, peace and war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I know there is a school of thought that suggests that the Commonwealth has limited <span class="highlight">powers</span> in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the proposed Human Rights Commission are very limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its <span class="highlight">powers</span> are limited to Commonwealth legislation only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have come to the view that because the Commission has no enforcement <span class="highlight">powers</span>, merely a conciliatory role, the worst it can do is to make a report to the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The more serious practical problem of the Murphy Bill was that it would have vastly extended Federal <span class="highlight">powers</span> at the expense of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The constitutional justification of this was the external affairs power; the doctrine that if we enter into a valid external treaty that obliges us to do certain things, the existence of the treaty gives the Commonwealth Parliament the <span class="highlight">powers</span> necessary to give effect to the treaty, even to the extent of <span class="highlight">powers</span> which would otherwise be beyond Commonwealth competence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main reason we are unhappy and disappointed with the Bill is that it does not contain <span class="highlight">powers</span> to enforce respect for human rights, or to change any law found to be in contravention of human rights, or to prosecute any person found to be violating human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, if the subject of a complaint is a Commonwealth Act- for instance, the Act relating to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and its violation of someone’s rights- it would be equivalent to appealing against the AttorneyGeneral to the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Worse still, these <span class="highlight">powers</span>, weak as they are, apply only to the Commonwealth law and to the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus the Commission may well be bypassed and <span class="highlight">powers</span> to investigate, for example, Aboriginal complaints in Queensland could be delegated to the Queensland authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Act there are <span class="highlight">powers</span> covering State law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are also <span class="highlight">powers</span> to prosecute as a last resort if conciliation fails. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As we rose above the law of the jungle and gave <span class="highlight">powers</span> to parliament our rights were curtailed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tenth and lastly, the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are not delegated nor by the Constitution prohibited to individual States are reserved either to those States or to the people themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This course of action is partly as a  reult  of severe constitutional question marks over the Federal Government’s <span class="highlight">powers</span> to legislate to protect and enforce human rights as well as the Government’s belief that the guaranteeing of these rights does not require a Bill of Rights and the accompanying judicial <span class="highlight">powers</span> of enforcement, believing instead that the present law adequately protects these rights and that Parliament is the more  appropriate  body to ensure the continued protection of these rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is the firearms and offensive weapons legislation which has only recently been introduced into the Queensland Parliament and which entitles the most extraordinarily wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> of search and seizure, detention on suspicion and the formation of vigilante groups with official State sanction to take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It may be that as a result of investigations of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission and subsequent investigations, or the operation of a sunset clause, the legislation will be found inadequate and that we will have to go further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But we are not prepared to impose <span class="highlight">powers</span> on the States which it may be doubtful we have at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To that extent, those <span class="highlight">powers</span> will be taken from the Commissioner for Community Relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the existing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commissioner for Community Relations will remain, subject to the changes I mentioned and subject to general directions given by the Human Rights Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-The <span class="highlight">powers</span> will remain subject to directions given by the Human Rights Commission, but obviously those <span class="highlight">powers</span> of direction will be exercised only in a general way because the existing <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commissioner for Community Relations will remain and will not be replaced in the Human Rights Commission exercising those <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the case of three authorities, including one primary industry authority, whose investment <span class="highlight">powers</span> have recently been under review, the Treasurer has taken the opportunity of empowering those authorities to invest temporarily surplus funds in deposits with the Primary Industry Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the real matter of importance that is involved here because despite the AttorneyGeneral’s endeavours yesterday to say that the Commissioner for Community Relations will continue to exercise in practice the untrammelled <span class="highlight">powers</span> that he has at present and that this is merely a formalisation of arrangements, the reality is that the legislation provides for the Commissioner for Community Relations,  Mr Grassby,  to become a mere cipher, a mere delegate, of the new Human Rights Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill, which had its second reading last night, the various <span class="highlight">powers</span> vested in the Commissioner are now to be taken from him and formally vested in the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is said, it is true, that he as an individual shall continue in practice to exercise those <span class="highlight">powers</span>, but subject at all times to the direction of the Human Rights Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally, it is apparent that  Mr Grassby,  under these new arrangements, is to have no control whatsoever over his staff, no <span class="highlight">powers</span> with respect to hiring and firing and no <span class="highlight">powers</span> with respect to the direction of priorities and work load amongst those staff members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that that opposition could have been expected to be displayed against any Federal authority which is attempting, in the view of State and- sectional interests, to interfere, as has been said, with what is seen as the sovereign <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the States- a misnomer, of course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think those amendments are really based upon the fact that it is felt that the combination of the present subclauses (l)(c) and (l)(d) creates ambiguity and reflects upon the independence of the Commission to carry out inquiries on its own intiative My proposal to add those words to sub-clause (l)(c) and to delete altogether sub-clause ( 1 ) (d), which does not seem to add anything to the broad <span class="highlight">powers</span> in sub-clause ( 1 )(c), will overcome some of the concerns which have been expressed and which I think have given rise to  Senator Missen  ‘s amendment and I rather suspect to  Senator Evans’s  amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sir Garfield ‘s passion for preserving the <span class="highlight">powers</span>, privileges and sanctity of the judiciary and the judicial process from any sullying by intrusion from the real world is well known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I indicate to the Minister that at the Committee stage we will move at least one other amendment which will seek to give the Parliament rather than the Minister some of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are proposed in the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We do not see any justice in taking from him <span class="highlight">powers</span> which I think he can exert responsibly and putting then in the hands of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I said that the Australian Democrats’ support of this Bill is conditional, I meant that it is conditional on the understanding, which we believe we can reasonably assume, that neither the Minister nor the Government intends to bring forward further amendments in the near future to this Bill which might in any way limit the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Northern Land Council to exercise a proper right of veto or otherwise over the question of the proceeding of Pancontinental Mining Ltd at Jabiluka. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true, as  Senator Cavanagh  pointed out, that when the Committee tried to find out why this provision was put into the original legislation no one really seemed to know why it was put in this unusual form, which we think is a disagreeable form and a form that weakens the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Houses of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In November 1 977  Mr Justice  Kaye held that a levy of the annual general service fee was beyond the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the University of Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This statement was issued by the Vice-Chancellor on 25 October this year when he made it absolutely clear- he was speaking undoubtedly on the University’s behalf- that he was unable to accept this interference with the discretionary <span class="highlight">powers</span> and activities of the University Council in this particular respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is perhaps noteworthy that the Public Works Committee has both of these <span class="highlight">powers</span>, and the Government believes that the same <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be conferred on the Public Accounts Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second element in the High Court Bill is the important and new provision it makes for the High Court to have separate administrative <span class="highlight">powers</span> with respect to its financial affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> now vested specifically in the High Court, which presently are exercised by the Attorney-General ‘s Department on behalf not of the Court but of the Commonwealth generally, include the power of the Court to enter into contracts, its power to deal in various ways with property, its power to manage buildings and the staff of the Court and also its power, which has raised some rather quizzical eyebrows in various quarters but 1 suppose one can assume that it will be administered sensibly to accept gifts, devices and bequests directed to the courts- one hopes with the best of motives- from various sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the notion that this kind of arrangement is demanded by the separation of <span class="highlight">powers</span> does not carry much conviction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, the credibility of the separation of <span class="highlight">powers</span> doctrine as a rationale for this arrangement is not really heightened by the failure of this Government, like its predecessors of all parties, to make similar arrangements for the Parliament- the third arm in the separated <span class="highlight">powers</span> trio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, I suggest that the Government’s credibility in advancing separation of <span class="highlight">powers</span> arguments as a justification for this new arrangement so far as the High Court is concerned would be enhanced by extending the same honour and courtesy to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How much easier is it going to be when the doctrine of the separation of <span class="highlight">powers</span> can be called in issue and the Minister can claim to have no responsibility at all to the Parliament for the way in which this money is spent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the points of the Bill which concern us most are those found in clauses 1 7 and 40, which are concerned directly with the High Court’s proposed new <span class="highlight">powers</span> to control its own finance in certain ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that clause 4 of the Remuneration and Allowances Bill 1979 sets out graphically the scant regard the Fraser Government has for what is commonly referred to as the doctrine of the separation of <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am of the opinion, and have been for a long time, that the power of the Parliament seems to disappear on matters relating to the Commonwealth’s constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> and its attempt to get uniform legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just wish to comment that it is important that further consideration be given to the form and <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commission in relation to hearings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government wishes the Commission to have wide <span class="highlight">powers</span> as to how it will conduct its affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clause in question lays down some provisions whereby it will have to sit in public or in private, depending upon the particular <span class="highlight">powers</span> that it is exercising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly this was amply demonstrated by the Rae report which made a very strong argument for the operation of a single national system of company law, implemented and enacted by the Commonwealth Parliament, pursuant to its constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> and also for a single national governmental regulatory body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The new approach the Rae Committee recommended was built very much around the concept of national legislation and national machinery established by that national legislation in pursuit of the Commonwealth’s constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even if, in fact, everyone were genuine about cooperative federalism the reference of particular <span class="highlight">powers</span> presently enjoyed by the States to the Commonwealth - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply suggest, indeed assert, that there is a substantial body of learned legal opinion which does not suggest that these <span class="highlight">powers</span> are available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The existing legislative scheme before the Senate attempts to deal with that to the extent that it vests basic <span class="highlight">powers</span>, for a start, all in the national commission and proceeds on the basis that the various State administrative agencies will operate thereafter by means merely of delegated power and be subject always, as I understand it, to the overriding direction of the national body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is clear from the <span class="highlight">powers</span> given in the Constitution, that this government was created to meet national needs relating to foreign corporations and trading or financial corporations  . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Evans  said that we should have proceeded at the national level only and imposed national companies and securities legislation by virtue of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that, in his view, the Commonwealth Parliament has and leave it to the High Court to resolve any doubts about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As far as ministerial responsibility is concerned, that cannot be affected by the exercise of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Minister under the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Rae  has said, and I am sure  Senator Evans  would not doubt it, the Minister and this Government and this Parliament will still retain what <span class="highlight">powers</span> they have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those acts and practices must relate to the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are already in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps I may add that, in the present state of international alignments, it would be hazardous for the Commonwealth to enter into new international obligations such as the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and yet not assume legislatively the necessary <span class="highlight">powers</span> to secure respect for those obligations throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 suggest that honourable senators should take into account the fact that Professor Julius Stone, who is an expert on international law and matters of law generally, points out that we really need to take up the legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> under the Covenant and see that they apply throughout Australia, or we shall leave ourselves open to criticism and attack by people who may say that we are not complying with our duties under the Covenant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact, our external <span class="highlight">powers</span> may not apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Department of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement and of Community Councils- which are merely fronts for many administrative decisions and actions- are destructive of communities in that they allow the removal of people from reserves often for minor reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another aspect of the Act that needs clarification is whether adequate <span class="highlight">powers</span> exist under the Act to ensure that quarantine operations can be undertaken on Aboriginal reserves established under Commonwealth legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is the situation today where we are completely in the grip of the Executive and of the bureaucracy, notwithstanding the attempts that have been made by the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives and the  President  of the Senate to grab back for the Parliament some of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that Parliament should have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-69-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was abundant evidence in subsequent debates in the Parliament, particularly in the Senate, when we were able to show that  Mr Viner  was in fact forcing the Aborigines to accept Government proposals and forcing them, because of his own persuasive <span class="highlight">powers</span>, ability, capacity and public position, to accept standards which they did not understand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-77">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In assessing the need for such a committee we noted that many Bills come before the Parliament which contain provisions that: Significantly interfere with personal rights and liberties; delegate <span class="highlight">powers</span> which, arguably, should not be delegated at all; delegate <span class="highlight">powers</span> to affect rights,  liberties  and obligations without providing an opportunity for the exercise of those <span class="highlight">powers</span> to be reviewed either by the Parliament itself or by an independent body; or delegate <span class="highlight">powers</span> to impose obligations without any clearly defined guidance as to who is to impose them, upon whom and in which circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-94">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cannot be said that, even in the Committee debate on Bills in the Senate, a great deal of consideration is given to questions of whether a Bill contains such <span class="highlight">powers</span> as a power of entry or search which it ought not to contain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-94">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an additional aid the joint committee would provide to each parliamentarian for his or her consideration a commentary on the Bill linking the operative provisions of the Bill to such questions as whether the Bill significantly alters or interferes with personal liberties and rights, delegates <span class="highlight">powers</span> which ought not to be delegated or in some way delegates power without giving sufficient consideration to ongoing parliamentary scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-94">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Another matter of concern is expressed in paragraph (f) of the amendment which seeks to define members of the Institute, their method of election, their duties and their <span class="highlight">powers</span> as members of the Institute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is my understanding that the present legislation, especially as regards the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Australian Wheat Board to market wheat in Australia, relies heavily on the decision of the High Court of Australia in the Clark v.

    <p>I ask you,  Mr President:  What is the use of having the office of the Auditor-General if his <span class="highlight">powers</span> and his supervision of government and semi-government departments are to be ignored firstly by the Minister and then by the Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They reflect the decision forced upon the Government, much to its embarrassment, by the recent report of  Mr Justice  Williams containing a recommendation to disband the Federal Narcotics Bureau and to vest the Federal narcotics law enforcement <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the new Australian Federal Police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first point to be made about the Bills in question is that they involve conferring on the Australian Federal Police <span class="highlight">powers</span> which in their scope and nature are sweeping and unprecedented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They include <span class="highlight">powers</span> to tap telephones, hitherto available only in the limited context of national security; <span class="highlight">powers</span> to install listening devices, previously not available at all under Commonwealth law but only under certain State laws; and <span class="highlight">powers</span> to intercept mail and other forms of telecommunications, unprecedented in any jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nonetheless, we make the point, as we have on the many occasions on which we have debated these matters in recent months, that <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this kind have an enormously destructive potential for civil liberties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Powers</span> in relation to the tapping of telephones and the installation of listening devices in particular by their very nature involve unselective, exploratory and indiscriminate invasions of people’s privacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throughout the argument on these matters the Opposition has taken the view that if these <span class="highlight">powers</span> are going to be available to anyone they must be accompanied by a range of appropriate safeguards governing their exercise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly we have moved, so far unsuccessfully, that when these <span class="highlight">powers</span> are exercised they should be exercised only in accordance with judicial warrants which are granted on the basis of extensive affidavits sworn in support of the applications for such warrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These attempts to write in safeguards of this kind have assumed particular importance in this narcotics context when one remembers the nature of the offences in relation to which these <span class="highlight">powers</span> can be exercised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">powers</span> relate not only to large-scale heroin traffickers whose activities we would all deplore and condemn, but also, under the terms of the Customs legislation as it now stands, are available for pursuit of what are, on any view, quite minor offenders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bearing all this in mind we see that the Parliament must scrutinise very carefully indeed the vesting of <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this kind in anybody. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, it is now proposed to vest these <span class="highlight">powers</span> not in the Narcotics Bureau, which has been disbanded, but rather in the Australian Federal Police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it really necessary to remind the Senate that the Opposition made exactly these same points a few months ago when we were debating the vesting of these <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the Narcotics Bureau? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be remembered, of course, that we said that however desirable it might be in the abstract for <span class="highlight">powers</span> of this kind to be available for narcotics law enforcement, it would be indefensible for the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government to be proposing to vest such <span class="highlight">powers</span> in a narcotics bureau which was itself then under a serious cloud, with unanswered allegations outstanding in respect of both its competence and, more particularly and more seriously still, its integrity and its freedom from corruption of an internal kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed to vest those very same <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the new Australian Federal Police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they cannot do so to the satisfaction of this Parliament and the public by next February, they must not have these sweeping <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remaining major matter relates to the opportunity that this legislation affords for the Australian Federal Police- indeed, other agencies, including the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation- to acquire new <span class="highlight">powers</span> by stealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">powers</span> to communicate information, derived from investigations of a notionally quite different kind, were alarming enough when they were vested in the Narcotics Bureau; but in many ways they are even more alarming when they are found vested, as they are by this legislation, in the Australian Federal Police, given the much wider range of ordinary law enforcement functions which are vested in that agency and the consequently greater temptation to use the narcotics <span class="highlight">powers</span> for the obtaining of evidence and information in relation to other classes of offences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was also provided in a recent ministerial directive on 23 October, the status of which remains a little equivocal when one compares it with the formal <span class="highlight">powers</span> in the text of the legislation, that personal information so described should not be communicated at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition acknowledges that the way in which these <span class="highlight">powers</span> to communicate information are exercised depends ultimately on the internal control that will be exercised within the Police Force and on how the disciplinary provisions which operate within the Police Force are applied; in other words, how straight the Police Force plays it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to realise that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> contained in this legislation, namely, <span class="highlight">powers</span> to intercept telephone conversations for investigations into likely narcotic offences, and the installation of listening devices for these same purposes, are <span class="highlight">powers</span> which have been the subject of a great deal of debate this year in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In principle these <span class="highlight">powers</span> have been acknowledged as necessary for the purposes of such investigations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are new <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of the debate this year and in view of the legislation which has been passed, the Parliament has agreed that those <span class="highlight">powers</span> are necessary for that purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only purpose of this legislation is to transfer the exercise of those <span class="highlight">powers</span> from the Narcotics Bureau, which was located in the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs, to the Australian Federal Police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important thing to recognise is that the <span class="highlight">powers</span> that are being given to the Australian Federal Police through this measure can be exercised only under a warrant obtained by a Federal Court judge or a State Supreme Court judge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have explained, this measure will simply transfer <span class="highlight">powers</span> from one body which has now been disbanded to the Australian Federal Police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliament has agreed that those <span class="highlight">powers</span> should be available to people engaged in the investigation of narcotics offences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second part of the amendment relates to the status of illegally obtained evidence under these new <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not propose that there would be any kind of legislative vacuum with no agency being able to exercise these new <span class="highlight">powers</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Ample time exists in the period between then and 28 February for the Government to bring forward enabling legislation to keep these <span class="highlight">powers</span> on foot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have taken an attitude that, in order to have a Human Rights Commission which has some power in terms of investigation and the ability to generate some publicity and some study of this matter, it is better to be in the position of having a commission- albeit a commission which we believe to be a weak one and one without the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of enforceability- than to have nothing at all, which seems to be the alternative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we are saying is that because that will be the situation very great care has to be taken in the selection of the wording of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> which will be given to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very great <span class="highlight">powers</span> will be given to the Government for very good economic reasons as  Senator Hall  has clearly pointed out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are suggesting is that this is the time and the only time at which we will be able to make sure that these <span class="highlight">powers</span> are kept within reasonable confines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>I ask whether this blunt, if unsympathetic, evaluation by a senator of the Australian Labor Party makes clear the absolute impropriety of attempting to bypass or ignore the Crown or the Queen ‘s representative and whether it indicates an implicit acceptance by the Labor Party of the possession by the Crown of reserve <span class="highlight">powers</span>, including particularly the power to dismiss a Government behaving illegally? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in assessing the effectiveness of that legislation we have reached firm conclusions as to the scope of the constitutional <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Commonwealth in respect to Aborigines, the extent and variety of <span class="highlight">powers</span> in respect to the acquisition of property and the constitutional requirements to provide ‘just terms’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>We believe that the report will add to the understanding by the Parliament and the people of the <span class="highlight">powers</span> and specific responsibilities of the Commonwealth towards Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders and encourage a surer exercise of such <span class="highlight">powers</span> and responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></li>
