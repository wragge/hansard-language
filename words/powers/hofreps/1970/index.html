<h3 id="sample-sentences">Sample sentences:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This is the relevance of the external affairs <span class="highlight">powers</span> and the need to decide it, because if by chance the Premier of Queensland is right he cannot, because his State possesses no international personality, argue his own case and he cannot adopt the simplistic method of saying: T invite an independent New Guinea to agree with me to draw a median line’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The States have a right to look to the Senate and to know what the <span class="highlight">powers</span> of the Senate are so that they can have the opportunity to press their views through the Senate - through the States’ House.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To understand what has happened and the amendment to what I understand the legislation seeks to achieve, we need to bear in mind continually the division of legislative <span class="highlight">powers</span> between the Commonwealth and Slate governments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The former deals essentially with the incorporation of co-operative trading societies, building societies and credit societies, their <span class="highlight">powers</span> and operation; the latter is an Act to facilitate the borrowing of money by co-operative building societies and the Commissioner for Housing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, I still have the telegram I received from you on 8 May 1973, calling upon me to withdraw my amendments to the Act which required that all union officers exercising <span class="highlight">powers</span> to make or alter rules, impose fines upon members, expel members or to exercise the functions of union management, must be elected by a direct vote of all of the union members likely to be affected by those decisions.</p>
