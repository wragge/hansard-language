<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A few days later Cambodia started negotiations with the North Vietnamese and the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Prime Minister aware that such actions are avowedly not the policy of the Croatian <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movement in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701027_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to a report that 4 union leaders have gone to Hanoi to find out the exact position regarding the fight for the <span class="highlight">liberation</span> of the Vietnamese people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table a document which I did not have time to table when I was speaking in this debate, lt purports to be a handbook of the Croatian <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movement <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What lessons have been learnt from the recent tragedy at the Olympic Games in Munich following the capture of Israeli athletes and the attempted hijacking of an aircraft by members of the Palestinian <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-19-5">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will he assure the House that the Government will not allow the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation to establish an information centre in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is on the recommendation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Government proposes in 1974-75 to provide $150,000 (not $150m as suggested by the honourable member) in humanitarian assistance to certain African national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-36-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Was the decision to make $ 1 50m aid available to the African <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movement made by the Minister’s predecessor; if not, by whom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-36-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the Palestinian <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation’s stated aim is to establish a Palestinian state which will absorb Israel and that the PLO has never retracted its demand for the destruction of the State of Israel? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Such a regime exists in Angola which is now under the political domination of the Marxist-Leninist Popular Movement for the <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> of Angola, known as MPLA. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suggestion that by making speeches in this chamber they will advance by one day the <span class="highlight">liberation</span> of eastern Europe is a sad deception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the question whether such negotiations are possible will depend upon a number of factors, one of the most important of which will be the recognition by the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation of Israel’s right to exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister give any details about the Congo National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front, the group which carried out the attack on Kolwezi? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister’s remarks have today been the subject of a bitter attack by the National Aboriginal and Islander <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The 1 977 elections were contested by the People’s Progressive Party, the United Parry, the National Convention Party and the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Thailand is next on the list for a ‘war of national <span class="highlight">liberation</span>’ there is no question at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front got into Hue, once their line of communication was broken they could not sustain their position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that occasion, he denounced proposals for stopping the bombing of North Vietnam and negotiating with the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front as ‘treason’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not heard one word from the Opposition about the offers made by President Johnson and by President Nixon to negotiate for peace anywhere, to stop the bombing and to include the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front in negotiations in an endeavour to obtain peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that I have no time for the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front and its bomb-throwing, but we can have no responsibility for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immediate withdrawal without conditions is a crucial demand of the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the first part of the honourable gentleman’s question, the Lon Nol Government did not ask for the assistance that was given by South Vietnam and the United States of America but yesterday the Premier himself,  Mr Lon  Nol, issued a statement in which he said that the <span class="highlight">liberation</span> government of Cambodia recognised that the action by the United States and South Vietnam was taken in order to achieve the freedom, the independence and the realisation of the highest ideals of the people and the Government of Cambodia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They recognise that they cannot win militarily but they believe that a process has been set in train, beginning with the cessation of the bombing of the North and including the decision to negotiate in Paris with the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front, which though tortuous will end in complete victory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was thought impossible not long ago due to the attitude of the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He and others carried out orders that were given to what is called the ‘Australian <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Army’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>with what appeared to be a local insurrection involving the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front - the Vietcong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What will happen if negotiations come and a ceasefire and some settlement are reached and the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front then has a big share of power in South Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front would then be powerful in South Vietnam, but so too must some religious and regional groups or there can be no negotiations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They tried a war of national <span class="highlight">liberation</span>, a war in which they dribbled a few people over the border at a time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He made no reference during his speech to the need to seek an honourable and satisfactory peaceful solution to this problem; no reference to the cessation of the bombing of North Vietnam which was agreed to by a former  President  of the United States; and no reference to the recognition of the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front as a party to any successful negotiations to find a solution to the problem in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a cessation of the bombing of North Vietnam; the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front has been recognised as a party to peace negotiations; but still this Government maintains that the war in Vietnam can b? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor do we regard Hanoi and the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front as blameless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What generosity that members of this organisation should come forward at this late stage and say: We do not regard Hanoi and the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front as blameless’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But today when we look around the world and find that brush/ire wars or wars of <span class="highlight">liberation</span> are conceived in the dark processes of the Kremlin in Moscow and behind the Gates of Heavenly Peace - a modern misnomer in Peking - and are then born in a hospital branded ‘peaceful cooperation’ in order to deceive other people as to the strategy and tactics used for world conquest, unfortunately we still have to expend large sums of money on defence that could bc better expended on social services, both here and in other countries in this region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On every hand it has been the North Vietnamese negotiators or those of the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are only a few of the recent so-called acts of <span class="highlight">liberation</span> which seem to have passed from public debate as a result of effective Communist propaganda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We understand that an honourable member on the Opposition side of the chamber has invited representatives of the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front to come to Australia to take part in the Vietnam Moratorium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A member of the Australian Labor Party has asked a member of the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front, or its representatives, to come here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This group - the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front, the Vietcong, North Vietnam, Hanoi or whatever you like to call it - has stated, through its spokesman, that it will conquer the world by using the peasant guerrillas in the jungles of South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that he would invite members of the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front, the Vietcong and North Vietnamese to come to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However much China’s actions are explained by Communist ideology, its imperialist history or its internal politics and nationalism, China’s international conduct in Korea, Tibet, India and Russia and support of so-called national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> fronts in South Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For it is true - and this I apprehend is the real force of the views of the honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant)  - that if the stakes were so vital in Vietnam that we were prepared to destroy that country, ready to risk nuclear war for it and tear our own communities apart rather than allow National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front participation in the government of Vietnam, then Cambodia was no less important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that in every world situation Chinese policy is to support the Mau Mau type of activity, the anarchist type of activity, the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front type of activity - the  sort  of thing that the Arab guerillas are engaging in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at least the people of Cambodia, by and large, were saved from the destruction of attacks from the North Vietnamese, the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front, the United States and the South Vietnamese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The South Vietnamese Government has repeatedly offered to enter into direct negotiations with the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-38-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Herbert Marcuse in his book ‘An Essay on <span class="highlight">Liberation</span>’, said concerning the effect of ideas and social organisations in the community: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Prime Minister and refers to the latest 8-point proposals put forward by the delegation of the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front at the Paris peace talks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will recall also that the charges against  Mr Dzu  were based on his advocacy of an end to the bombing of North Vietnam and negotiations with the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It believes in the concept of ultimate Communist world domination through local wars of national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> achieved through a condition of world revolution and the acts of violence committed at Moratorium demonstrations, university sit-ins, etc, to which I have been personally subjected and which arc the local manifestation of Maoism in action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were advised by the senior officers and by anybody who cared to talk that perhaps 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the people in this town were still supporters of the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other aspect of this campaign was quite clearly embraced in part of the activities of the honourable member for Lalor, in his invitation to representatives of Hanoi, the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front - the Vietcong - to come to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I was in Vietnam some 5 or 6 months ago I visited a fair sized town with a population of about 9,000 people and the authorities there believed that about 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the people there still supported the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710219_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the stage has been reached when the Government of South Vietnam can send 40,000 or 50,000 troops into Cambodia - another country - and 10,000 or 20,000 troops into Laos - another country - it should be expected that that Government has the power to establish order in a small province some 40 or 50 miles from Saigon, a province more than half of which has never at any stage been strongly influenced by National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710219_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I recognise that there are elements of nationalism in the Saigon Government which are worthy of election by the people and I am quite sure that had the Vietnamese been allowed to govern their own affairs they would have shared power in a coalition with other elements, whether they, had been the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front, the [Buddhists or other political parties opposed to United States involvement in their country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710225_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This could be either through armed force or through some sort of peaceful merger, but there is not a shadow of a doubt that Communist Chinese policy is to liberate Taiwan, and we have lived long enough with wars of national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> to know what they mean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At present, refugees are still coming out from East Pakistan at the rate of more than 100,000 a week, many of them fleeing because of the operations of the Indian supported <span class="highlight">liberation</span> army. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If India is sincere in its desire to minimise the refugee problem and to get the refugees back to their homeland quickly, the Indian Government must withdraw all support from the <span class="highlight">liberation</span> guerrilla army and discourage its activities so far as this lies within the Government’s power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Added to this we have the continuing unrest generated by guerrilla warfare and so called wars of national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> and the very real possibility of a major confrontation between India and Pakistan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, at this stage of our history, according to Opposition members, it is not a matter of remembering that we called and they came and helped us in our hour of need; it is a matter of knocking them right, left and centre, embarrassing them in every field and, as the honourable member for Lalor  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  did in the ‘Australian Left Review’, standing up for national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements throughout the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among the changes in policy this would bring are:  (1)  An end to the principle that the US alliance is crucial, and  a  beginning of support for the ‘human rights’ revolution around the world most often expressed in the national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By this wording ANZUS is to be twisted lo become a human rights national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Had this happened the large red centre of the Bangla Desh flag, which indicates the blood of those who gave their lives in their fight for <span class="highlight">liberation</span>, might not have appeared so prominently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many people have asked why it is that they have returned in such numbers so soon after <span class="highlight">liberation</span> and what they could possibly hope to find from the ruins of their homes and villages and the sad memories that precipitated their departure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No, the Foreign Minister says, the Prime Minister was wrong in saying that they gave the pervasive influence of the People’s <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Army in China as the reason why the then Minister for the Army had to resign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said they had given as the reason the importance of the People’s <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Army in Chinese affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chinese side stated that it firmly supports the struggles of all oppressed people and nations for freedom and <span class="highlight">liberation</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This, of course, is a reference to wars of national <span class="highlight">liberation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody who supposes that when the statement appears in the communique that the Chinese still, as in the past, support unequivocally wars of national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> - we know what that phrase means - and that peace is likely to ensue, is rather more naive or perhaps more disingenuous than I would suppose him to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The opposition to the Saigon Government until that time had been almost entirely from the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front - the Vietcong - and that was not until the United States began bombing North Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When questioned as to what changes this would bring if it occurred, the honourable member replied that the ALP policy would be changed to bring an end to the principle that the United States alli ance is crucial and that there would be  a  beginning of support for the human rights revolution around the world, more often expressed in the national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the surrender of the French at Dien Bien Phu the true war of <span class="highlight">liberation</span> was over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This blatant attack, an echo of the blitzkrieg tactics of some 30 years ago, demands a statement from the Government so that all Australians and the rest of the world may be left in no doubt as to where we stand in condemning this attack by North Vietnam to achieve by military means what it has been unable to achieve by other means, including the now familiar subversive and terrorist tactics of the socalled war of national <span class="highlight">liberation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Against the opposi tion of this Government the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, that the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front should be recognised as a party to any negotiations for peace in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bombing did stop; the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front was accepted as a party to the negotiations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An attack was launched, not under the disguise of a people’s <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movement, but formally, with regular army divisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>We recognise that the Vietcong - the socalled National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front - represents a very substantial point of view in South Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the statements of the Leader of the Opposition are only to cover over the facade until after the election, if the statements of  Mr Ken  Carr, who, on behalf of the 26 revel unions in Victoria spoke to the motion on Vietnam moved by the Victorian Branch of the Australian Labor Party, are correct, that every true Socialist in the Labor Party supports the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front and wants the Communists to win in Vietnam - if these are the true outlooks of the Australian Labor Party - after the election it will be too late for the Australian people to say that they did not know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>and a beginning of support for the human rights’ revolution, around the world most often expressed in the national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is an indication of support from the Labor Left not for our traditional friends and allies, the United Kingdom and the United States, but for the national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements supported by Hanoi and Peking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a commentator were to ask me what I thought the left wing would say I would say quite frankly that the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front would be all for it but that at the present moment the members of the left wing of the Labor Party are all on holidays. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I see a gentleman who is overseas trying to persuade those with whom we wish to be friends that what they read in the Australian newspapers, which are purveyed overseas - that the Labor Party in Victoria has supported the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front and that various leading members of the Labor Party see nothing wrong in the North Vietnamese moving into South Vietnam - is not true. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me repeat this for the edification of workers such as my friends in Ballarat who work in factories and workshops, good solid Australians and who are being led by people who are not working in the national interest but are acting as crusaders for the <span class="highlight">liberation</span> of homosexuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is drawing a very long bow and is basing his argument on false premises when he attempts to draw an analogy between allowing a member of a parliament of the British Commonwealth having a complete and unrestricted right to come into Australia against the decision of the Australian Government not to grant a visa to representatives of the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation or the South African Cricket Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member of Barker has tried to compare the situation of refusing members of the Palestinian <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation a visa to enter Australia- I certainly make no apology for that; it was a very correct decision- and of refusing an official of the South African Cricket Association a visa to come to Australia with the situation with regard to  Mr Stonehouse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Cabinet decision was made in respect of a particular application and it was made in the light of the dissension which would have been caused in the community if the visit of the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation had taken place at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the Prime Minister’s reply seemed to indicate that an application for admission to Australia by a Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation delegation might be considered more favourably now than at the time of its rejection just a few weeks ago can the Prime Minister say: Firstly, has there been any evidence in the meantime of any change in the basic PLO program calling for the elimination of Israel as a sovereign independent state? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia has provided an amount of $150,000 as humanitarian assistance for national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements in Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-82-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Australian contribution was allocated for a United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) project in Zambia which was designed to assist women and children under the care of a number of <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements, including the Popular Movement for the <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> of Angola (MPLA), the South-West African People’s Organisation (SWAPO), the Zimbabwe African People’s Union (ZAPU), the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) and the African National Congress (ANC). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-82-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-On 3 June I spoke against the granting of visas by Australia to members of the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation leader, Gamal elSurani, says only his age has prevented him from physically fighting for the PLO cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the International Labour Organisation Conference in Geneva on 12 June this year the Austraiian Government voted for a motion to allow <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements recognised by the Organisation of African Unity and the League of Arab States to attend the conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The PLO, being one of the <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements recognised by the OAU and by the League of Arab States, was able to attend and participate in the deliberations of the International Labour Organisation Conference while still being pledged to destroy a member of the ILO, namely, Israel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is most important that the Australian people are given an explanation of the Austraiian Government’s attitude towards the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The building of the base, which is close to the area in which the national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movement of the people is being intensified, is a particular danger for the countries of South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It seems that sections of the Labor Party sympathetic to the acts of the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation have opposed an Australian peace keeping offer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I query the proposed payment by Australia again in this current financial year of the sum of $150,000-one cannot say that that is a large sum, but it is a significant sum- for the purpose of ‘humanitarian assistance to national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements in Africa’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Ryan also raised the question of the appropriation of $ 1 50,000 for humanitarian assistance to national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements in Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1974-75 Australia allocated $150,000 for mothers and children in Zambia under the care of a number of <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He spoke about the finance that was made available to the national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Government will look at this situation and the assistance that is given to these national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I would like to respond to a point made by the honourable member for Lyne  (Mr Lucock),  who preceded me in the debate, about humanitarian assistance provided by the Australian Government for national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements in Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Organisations such as the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund and the Red Cross provide humanitarian relief programs for those affected by the struggle for <span class="highlight">liberation</span> in a number of southern African countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1974-75 the Australian contribution funded assistance for mothers and children in Zambia under the care of a number of <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It stated that the honourable member for Lalor  Dr Jim  Cairns, was hobnobbing with the pro-Ustasha Croatian <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have noted the wide degree of recognition of the Popular Movement for the <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> of Angola, known as MPLA by African states as well as by states in Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, fears were held last year that the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation would not only be allowed into Australia but that the Labor Party’s love affair with a foreign power would blossom and that PLO offices would open here under the auspices of a Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A special maturity is required of progressive people, to realise that some of their colleagues who are workers or just of an older generation may not have had the opportunity to broaden their horizons far enough to really understand by say certain environmental concerns, or the <span class="highlight">liberation</span> of women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am moved to rise this evening by some remarks made by the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder)  who persists in the view that every supporter of a <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movement in Africa is in some way supporting the communists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two or 3 years ago the rest of the world supporting the <span class="highlight">liberation</span> of Angola, as surely as at that time the honourable member for the Northern Territory was supporting its enslavement by the Portuguese, recognised as the government- the government not only in exile but in liberated areas- the government of Holden Roberto of the FNLA. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He merged the cause of national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> with the goal of social revolution to overthrow the Chinese ruling class. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason was that the Treasurer in the provisional government that followed the <span class="highlight">liberation</span>- whatever you might like to call it- last year cancelled all of the advertising which we intended to undertake to explain to the people why and how the new tax scheme would work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fretilin heroism and the heroism of the Timorese people, their courage and the fine example of their leaders in defying 30 000 Indonesian regular soldiers has won the admiration of <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third matter I wish to raise relates to the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The debate is a slanging match between pro-Arab, proPalestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation forces and Zionists in the language of 1948. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many people believed that our main concern was for the minority of career-minded women with higher education; that we were interested in abstract questions of women’s rights and women’s <span class="highlight">liberation</span> rather than bread and butter issues; that the opportunities of professional women came before the needs of housewives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In its report the Committee was particularly concerned about the recruitment of British subjects in the armed forces of the National Federation for the <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> of Angola. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People came out of those countries and found themselves in another service overseas fighting ostensibly for the <span class="highlight">liberation</span> of a country which, for legal purposes, had been taken over in a friendly way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a possibility- though it may seem remote- that the oxygen supply may get out of control; this would lead to melting of the entire reactor and the <span class="highlight">liberation</span> of vast amounts of toxic gases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In December 1974, the previous Government contributed $ I 50,000 to UNICEF to assist in a UNICEF project in Zambia directed at providing humanitarian and educational aid to refugees there connected with a number of <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements, one of which was SWAPO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously  Mr Hartley  and his advocacy for the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation and the intrusions that he has made on the financing of the Australian Labor Party would seem to have prejudiced attitudes that members of the Opposition have in this place in this sort of cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770504_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Committee accepts such a concept in principle, it believes that Israel cannot be expected to allow a Palestinian homeland so close to the bulk of Israel’s population until such time as the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation accepts Israel’s right to exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While it opposed the establishment of a Palestinian <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation controlled West Bank state, it endorsed the concept of a Jordanian solution for the political expression of Palestinian rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regretably, I fear, this is probably what the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation really wants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real basis for negotiations is not the stance of the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation but the United Nations resolutions 242 and 338. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main difficulty, is the question of the recognition of the status of the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, whilst I do not express the views of the mission, it is public knowledge that the Arab states demand, firstly, that the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation be represented at the Geneva conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Israel must be guaranteed secure borders and the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation must accept that Israel has that basic right to exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Anyone reading this report and unfamiliar with the politics of the Middle East may well throw up his hands in despair at what appears to be the impossibility of finding a solution that will satisfy everyone-Egypt, Syria, the Lebanon, the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation and Israel, not to mention the many other neighbouring Arab countries which abound in the region and the two super powers that wield such influence there, the Soviet Union and the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation’s demand that there should be a ‘democratic secular state’ of Palestine incorporating Israel is guaranteed to bring a horse-laugh in Israel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During my visit in April to France I took the opportunity to spend Anzac Day at Villers-Brettoneux, in whose <span class="highlight">liberation</span> Australian forces played a major part 60 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Though some royalist emigres, in the context of the post war situation, advocated an independent status for Slovenia and described themselves as in favour of a ‘Free Slovenia ‘ as some form of constitutional monarchy, the only coherent war-time force dedicated to the <span class="highlight">liberation</span> and reconstitution of Slovenia was the ‘National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Anti-Fascist Front’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780523_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-11-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The background to these events is that the attack on Kolwezi was carried out by a group calling itself the Congo National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front- the group referred to in the honourable member’s question- which was apparently based on former Katangan secessionists living in Angola. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The building of the base which is close to the area in which the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movement of the peoples is being intensified is a particular danger for the countries of South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not know anybody in Ustasha and I have no sympathy for Ustasha, but I would never presume to defame every Palestinian as a member of the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation; I would never presume to defame every Irishman as a member of the Irish Republican Army. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the new technology is an instrument of <span class="highlight">liberation</span>, enabling them to do other things, to fill their life span more usefully, that is splendid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We talked to representatives of the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular we talked to George Habash and officers of the Popular Front for the <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> of <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Given that the <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movement in Zimbabwe has stated repeatedly that whites will be welcome to stay in that country and that they have important functions to perform in an independent Zimbabwe if they genuinely accept the principle of majority rule, I ask: On what grounds would the whites considered under the contingency plan be classified as refugees? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, talking to China, through you, I say: You should have been supporting Vietnam in its struggle for <span class="highlight">liberation</span> instead of making territorial claims to enrich yourself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>opposes the Soviet Union instead of uniting with it, opposes the People’s democracies instead of uniting with them, opposes the Communists, the proletariat and the People’s forces in all countries instead of uniting with them, opposes the national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements, instead of uniting with them and all the oppressed nations  . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>then one will, of course, unite with the United States and other imperialists, will of course line up with the imperialists, will of course line up with the imperialist camp, will of course fail to achieve national <span class="highlight">liberation</span>, will never accomplish anything in the cause of socialism, will of course make one’s own nation prey to the deception and aggression of the United States and other imperialists, with the result that one’s own nation will lose its independence and become a colony of the imperialists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Also, the Vietnamese Ambassador to Australia has been on record recently as stating that Vietnam will provide troops and weapons, if necessary, to assist <span class="highlight">liberation</span> forces in other parts of the world to relieve the burden of what he calls oppressed people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fifth comment I make is that conditions in Vietnam and other IndoChinese countries continue to be so appalling since the so-called <span class="highlight">liberation</span> that many of its citizens are prepare to risk their lives in leaving the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) I am advised that a Soviet citizen,  Mr Igor  Vyacheslavovich Ogurtsov, a co-founder and leader of an organisation known as the All Russian Social Christian Union for the <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> of the People, was sentenced in 1 968 to 1 5 years’ imprisonment, to be followed by periods in a labour camp and internal exile. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-48-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These reasons include the attitudes towards women’s <span class="highlight">liberation</span>, a community acceptance that many married women may work, and the higher education which has given women the ability and desire to participate more actively in community affairs and business and other related influences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, it is reported today that  Mr Robert  Mugabe, leader of the Zimbabwe African National Union- the section of the Front based in Mozambique- has strongly denounced the London conference and urged full concentration on a war of <span class="highlight">liberation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From the Battle of Burma to the <span class="highlight">liberation</span> of Singapore, his exploits were matters of the greatest concern for this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This came from an organisation calling itself the Jammu and Kashmir <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front, and suggested that the safety of the Australian cricketers would be endangered if the game went ahead at Srinagar as planned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Well firstly I didn’t speak on behalf of the Irish Republican Army, I spoke of a supporter of the Irish <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Forces of the Irish Republican Army, not a spokesman for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was not in Ireland specifically on a holiday, he was there most likely to gather information on the activities of the Irish <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Forces in that part of Ireland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A 79 year old man could be instrumental in gathering more information from the people of that particular part of Ireland on the activities of the Irish <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Forces than will say a much younger man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>-Did the Prime Minister, on 18 February or thereabouts, write to a senior Sydney businessman with Middle East government connections saying that not only is it no secret that he regretted the need for the Government decision on the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation visas but also if the PLO wishes to send representatives to Australia it should now make applications through Australian diplomatic posts? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></li>
