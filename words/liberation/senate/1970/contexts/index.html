<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Senator McManus  has said that all groups have their own <span class="highlight">liberation</span> fronts within Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What were the remarks made by  Mr Whitlam  concerning  Dr Cairns  and his invitation for the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front and Hanoi representatives to visit <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister subscribe to the views expressed by  Senator Wright  when representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the former Government, that any fragmentation of Yugoslavia as desired by certain members of the Croation <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movement would increase tension in Europe and provide an opportunity for the Soviet Union to pursue its expansionist territorial policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has his attention been drawn to newspaper reports-last weekend that the Palestinian <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movement has established a 20-storey headquarters in East Berlin? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Government rescind its decision to acknowledge the Soviet Union as the rightful government of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and support the continuing struggle of the Baltic people for national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> and self-determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Government aware of an organisation called Terrorist International which is the fraternity of national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements around the world? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Government also aware that organisations such as the Black September Movement, the Japanese Red Army, the Irish Republican Army and <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements which have been granted financial assistance by the Australian Government are members of Terrorist International? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Government concerned that its policy of granting financial aid to African <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements raises the possibility that Australia will become tainted by association with this terrorist group? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is unable to confirm that any of the African national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements are members of Terrorist International. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the proposals which are contained in the 1974-75 Budget are passed by the Parliament, aid to the African <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements will take the form of humanitarian assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has no fear that the proposed humanitarian assistance to African national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements will involve Australia by association with Terrorist International. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In giving such assistance Australia would be joining Canada, the Netherlands, the Federal Republic of Germany, Sweden, Finland, Norway and other countries who together with the specialised agencies of the United Nations give humanitarian assistance to the African national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>9 titled ‘Australia’s External Aid 1 974-75 ‘ allocated $ 1 50,000 for humanitarian assistance to National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movements in Africa; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>9 titled ‘Australia’s External Aid 1974-75’ allocated $150,000 for humanitarian assistance to National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movements in Africa; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that case, can the Minister explain why this money is not allocated specifically by description to, say, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees instead of National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movements in Africa? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Foreign Affairs say whether the Australian Government intends to recognise the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs: Does the Government intend formally to recognise the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Agriculture: Is it true as claimed by Sydney businessman  Mr Reuben  F. Scarf in Press reports that Australia’s cancellation of a visit by the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation has cost Australia a $20m meat contract with Iraq? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has nothing to do with the decision by the Government recently not to grant visas to representatives of the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the organisations said to be responsible for today’s event is the Popular Front for the <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> of Palestine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Marxist Palestinian Leader George Habash said today that his Popular Front for the <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> of Palestine would do all in its power to provoke a new Middle East war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That statement, taken in conjunction with the fact that that organisation is one of those organisations of which the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation is the umbrella organisation, prompts me to remind you,  Mr President,  that the leader of the PLO, Arafat himself, stated as recently as 12 March 1970: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the report that a visa has been issued for the entry to Australia of a representative of the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation correct? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, it understands the frustration felt by the <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movement in Southern Rhodesia in the face of the intransigence shown and the repression carried out by the illegal Smith regime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-56-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 1974-5 Budget included an amount of $150,000 for humanitarian assistance to national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements in Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-56-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This assistance is being provided through a United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF) project in Zambia involving the provision of educational, medical and welfare assistance for women and children under the care of a number of national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements who have temporarily settled in Zambia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-56-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>) Has the Government any objection to aiding victims of terrorist attacks by so-called <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-56-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government contributed to the welfare of members of the so-called <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-56-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Is a Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation super-frank appearing on letters originating in Saudi Arabia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, is this a revenue raising device by Saudi Arabia and apparently by the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation a beneficiary under the International Postal Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation been admitted as a member of the International Postal Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understood that the Labor Party policy in 1966 was that, as a means of bringing the war to an end, Australia should forthwith stop the bombing of North Vietnam, it should recognise the <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front as a party to negotiations and it should transform the operations in Vietnam into what are called ‘holding operations’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But with a change in events over the period we have now seen a cessation of the bombing of North Vietnam, a recognition of the <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front as a party to negotiations, and a transformation of the operations in South Vietnam to holding operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already one sees the propaganda and the pamphlets which are put out by the various bodies which espouse, for example, solidarity with the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point I make, lest people think that this is a far-fetched fantasy, is that in Melbourne we have a group that calls itself the Vietnam <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is a domino theory and if we are to chase the progress of the domino theory which is said to be the aspiration of the <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movement throughout South East Asia, then we will kill more than the 400 young Australians whom we have sacrificed already in the calamity that i,s Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have indicated in their Communist Journal, the ‘Tribune’, that they desire to make a specific contribution of solidarity with the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told that we went into this war in Vietnam in order to withstand the downward thrust of Chinese Communism: that behind the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front in South Vietnam stood Hanoi, and behind Hanoi stood the Communist Government in <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For my authority I take statements which have been made by the leaders of North Vietnam and the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A short while ago as a little exercise I took out some of the statements emanating from the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front and North Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The M  I-“  undertake^ lo  dereion the  <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Armed Forces with the aim of promoting the  people’s war, combining guerilla with regular warfare, wiping out as many live enemy forces, as possible, crushing the enemy’s will for aggression, and winning the final victory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It emanates from the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people who are now trying very carefully to divert this argument to one about the national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> forces &lt;bd the nag were the people who, during the debates in the Senate last week, accepted the principle that there was a right to protest against the Government’s policies on matters of defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not like seeing demonstrations and I would not take part in a peace demonstration willingly when there was a Vietcong flag ahead of me, but if someone ahead of me in a peace procession hoisted a National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front flag I would not take any action to get him out because I could not and 1 would not use force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason and because of the interest of the Vietnamese people in the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front in areas of South Vietnam that the NLF has controlled for up to 15 years, the Government cannot cope with the situation and is relying on its friends - the United States and ourselves - to hold the position by military means, which finally we will find will be incomplete and unsatisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among the demonstrators were people who said that they did not support the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact that the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front has been occupying large areas of north east Cambodia for years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of them was that he hoped that American forces would remain inside Cambodia until the time when they had won a complete victory over the forces of the North Vietnamese and the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front of South Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are Catholics in the leadership of the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it can be seen that the majority of deaths caused during the supposed massacre, the taking of reprisals and killings following the Tet offensive in 1968 were caused not by the Vietcong National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front armies but by American bombing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government also noted that part of the policy of the United Front is the recognition of the provisional government established by the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front of South Vietnam as the Government of South Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is one of the untruths which have been repeated continually by this Government, namely, that the Vietnamese Government in Hanoi and the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front in South Vietnam have been acting in some way in- defiance of the Geneva Agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front, whose armed forces were known as the Vietminh, whose leader was the late Ho Chi Minh, and whose seat of government was in Hanoi, were to be given jurisdiction over the northern sector of Vietnam, and the French, who then were the colonial power in Vietnam, were to be given jurisdiction over the southern part of Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That government refused to carry OUt the terms of the Agreements, and it was only when it became obvious that the United States and the puppets of the United States were not carrying out the terms of the Geneva Agreements that the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front in South Vietnam engaged in armed activity in order to see that the people of Vietnam would be able to conduct their own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As to whether or not 1 still maintain that there is no Ustasha terrorist Croatian <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movement in Australia, I think the honourable senator is aware that I stated in late July, after intensive investigations had been made into allegations that there was a Croatian terrorist organisation in Australia, that the police investigations, State and Commonwealth, had revealed no credible evidence that such  a  terrorist organisation existed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would not go so far as to say there are guerrillas in Croatia because that expression could be interpreted wrongly but I would say that money helps the Croats at home to raise their voice for <span class="highlight">liberation</span> of the country,. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I asked:  ls the Attorney-General aware that the  Croatain  <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movement magazine ‘Spremnost’ makes reference in its columns to the  Utasha  and has frequently written commendatory articles about its activities both in and out of Yugoslavia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister also aware that another senior member of the Croatian <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movement, a senior public servant,  Mr Kokic,  is employed by the Department of Labour and National Service Employment Counselling Service in Melbourne? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  started off to point out to  Senator McManus  that his friend, if he is his friend,  Mr Kokic  in Melbourne who is employed in the Commonwealth Employment Service is a member of the senate or committee of the Croatian <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can take honourable senators to any one national group and show them freedom movements, <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements which are of course endemic to the group, because they all live with the hope that one day the tyranny of the Iron Curtain will end and they can be free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But one can start with a basic assumption, namely, that the Croats and the Hungarians - and does anyone deny the Hungarians the right to have a <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do you deny them the right to have a <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movement, and the Czechs and the Poles? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have said that these men are leading members of the Croatian <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movement, and then the Labor Party spokesmen have said it is the Croatian <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movement which has caused this violence - that is what has been implied - and that these men are guilty men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, what  Mr Lovokivic  said tonight with the TDT interviewer trying to pin Ustasha upon him was this: T am an active member of the Council of the Croatian <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an essential paraphrase, but to suggest tha; from it the Croatian <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movement was said by  Mr Luvokivic  to be the Ustasha is to corrupt the whole basis of the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When  Senator Carrick  said that by accusing people of being members of the Croatian <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He said that they are members of the <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movement but he does not say that they are responsible for the violence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In Australia there is hardly any organisation of migrants from behind the Iron Curtain which does not have a <span class="highlight">liberation</span> front. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a difference between a <span class="highlight">liberation</span> front and a body which indulges in violence in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a <span class="highlight">liberation</span> front in this country which had members with names such as O’Byrne, Mulvihill, Cavanagh and McManus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Opposition senators know, there was a <span class="highlight">liberation</span> front, and the leader of their Party was one of the heads of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is nothing wrong in having a <span class="highlight">liberation</span> front as long as its members stand merely for the <span class="highlight">liberation</span> of a country and do not use violence or illegal methods to bring that about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People are allowed to have a <span class="highlight">liberation</span> front as long as it does not indulge in breaking the law or resorting to violence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator O’Byrne  is my authority for the the fact that the <span class="highlight">liberation</span> front therefore cannot be attacked I think that what has been said in this debate is completely ridiculous and does no credit to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He spoke about migrants and their feelings about <span class="highlight">liberation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It sickens me to hear  Senator Carrick  get up in this chamber and ask by rhetoric: ‘Are the Czechs entitled to have their <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movement here? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are the Hungarians entitled to have their <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movement here?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice that  Senator Douglas  McClelland did not talk about any tourist organisation; he talked about the Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood and the Croatian <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I daresay that if the Australian people were asked whether these foreign <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements that are operating in Australia were to be tolerated in this country they would have an overwhelming answer to that question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we had also the statements, from one or two members of the Opposition that all these people - and ‘all these people’ meant the 500,000-odd members of the Croatian <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movement - should be thrown out of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And what were  Senator O’Byrne’s  remarks while  Senator McManus  was speaking and pointing out that many of these people have come here as refugees from Communist countries and that we must recognise that in almost every one of these Communist countries there is a <span class="highlight">liberation</span> front? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator O’Byrne’s  interjection was: ‘What a great shame to have a <span class="highlight">liberation</span> front’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Leaders of the Croatian extremist organisations have said that they would be prepared to receive aid from any source, including the Soviet Union, for the <span class="highlight">liberation</span> of Croatia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720921_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the AttorneyGeneral been advised that the Yugoslav Government has asked the United States Government to curb Croatian terrorists because of its concern that the Croatian <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movement may gain world wide recognition and that the Yugoslav Government also has asked the Nixon Administration to suppress Croatian publications openly advocating revolution and the assassination of President Tito? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Also, in view of the Yugoslav action in relation to the United States of America, is it still believed that the Croatian <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movement is a myth in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What does the Attorney-General propose to do about the persons referred to in (1) and (2) who openly and actively associate with the Croatian <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Lovokovic, the Editor of ‘Spremnost’, is understood to be a leading member of the organisation known as the Croatian <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movement in Australia and he is a member of the Liberal Party Migrant Advisory Council in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Membership of the Croation <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movement does not, of itself, involve any offence against Commonwealth law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is therefore no action which I can take against a person merely because he is a member of the Croatian <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators have to take into consideration that the Croatian <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movement had this to say on the occasion of its 25th Anniversary: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report, which was sent to the Australian Government from the Yugoslav Government, goes on to say that the terrorists have received instructions in the use of mining devices at the Croatian Catholic Welfare Centre in Sydney; that they have received military training at a camp operated by the Croatian <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movement; that they have had training in the use of weapons and explosives; and that they have been supervised by members of the Regular Army at Wodonga. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ‘our country’ in this document is not Australia but Croatia -  is suffering and groaning in the fetters of SerboCommunist thraldom, a handful of uncompromising and fanatical Croatian patriots have formed the Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood; they were guided in their effort by the pure and decent idea of giving allout support to the <span class="highlight">liberation</span> of the Croatian people and to the establishment of a sovereign state of Croatia, based on the principles of social justice, as so splendidly expounded in the Fundamental Principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As to whether or not I still maintain that there is no Ustasha terrorist Croatian <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movement in Australia, I think the honourable senator is aware that I stated in late July, after intensive investigations had been made into allegations that there was <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he is an honest broker, not for China, as he is reported to have said, but for Australia he should have gone to China and said: ‘It is pre-eminently in the interests of the people of this region and the world that South East Asia should be stable; that countries like Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Burma should have the right to separate sovereignty and separate existence and not have the fear that by subversion, by the inducing of <span class="highlight">liberation</span> fronts, that they can be destroyed; that we as their good neighbours respect their right to co-exist. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The undersigned men and women of Australia vigorously protest against your Government’s reported provision of Government funds amounting to $150,000 to African <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movements this year, which amounts to contravention of United Nations Charter and is direct interference in internal affairs of African countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-My question to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs relates to a recent editorial which referred to possible aid from the Federal Budget for the African <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had some furtive report that the Government- I think that the Minister had to acknowledge this- is providing aid to the <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements in Africa to overthrow their colonial yoke and injustices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if this Government were consistent, if it believed in the right of self-determination, if it really believed in the role of self-determination, then it would be giving aid to the <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements in the Baltic States so that they could overthrow the savage yoke of the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently, the Government has one standard for the countries that have <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements that have Communist Chinese support and another standard for those countries that wish to overthrow the brutal yoke of the Communist countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Greenwood  conceded, the only hope that these Baltic people have of being independent of their present oppressors- I freely concede that the Russians are their oppressors; I do not mince words about that- is in the aftermath of some cataclysm which I trust none of us here is barracking for, because the consequences of such a cataclysm would be not only the <span class="highlight">liberation</span> of the Baltic peoples but also more likely than not the destruction of Western civilisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Government aware of the existence of an organisation called Terrorist International, which is the fraternity of national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements around the world? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Government also aware that organisations such as the Black September Movement, the Japanese Red Army, the Irish Republican Army and <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements which have been granted financial assistance by the Commonwealth Government are members of Terrorist International? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Government concerned that its policy of granting financial aid to African <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements raises the possibility that Australia will become tainted by association with this terrorist group? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The notes which were provided for me by the Minister state that in an article by Denis Warner in this morning’s Sydney ‘Morning Herald’- it may have been yesterday- the decision to give assistance to African <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements was attacked on the grounds that it would lead to support of terrorist movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In meeting these social and economic needs in areas such as medical assistance, education, agricultural extension services and temporary housing, Australia would be joining Canada, the Netherlands, West Germany, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Norway and other countries, together with the specialised agencies of the United Nations such as the Food and Agriculture Organisation, the United Nations Childrens Fund, the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation and the World Health Organisation in giving humanitarian assistance to the African national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is not the admission by the United Nations of the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation into a United Nations debate a regrettable recognition by the world body that international terrorism pays? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister read the description in the editorial of one of our Australian newspapers of the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation as responsible for more murderous terrorism outside Northern Ireland than any other organisation in the world? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He added that if a representative of the PLO had addressed one of those committees he would have been listened to just as closely, whether or not he was speaking for the whole of the Palestinian Arab <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movement and whatever views we may have about some of the methods of that Movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One area in which it seems that the agency may have some responsibility came up for discussion in the deliberations of Senate Estimates Committee B, and it was raised again during question time this afternoon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It relates to the line in the estimates which refers to the allocation of $150,000 for the <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movement in Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I have some doubts and questioning in my mind when sums of money are provided under the terms of international aid and which can be used for what are called national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements which could have a strong relationship with organisations of a terrorist or guerrilla nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could well be that national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements of varying kinds arise in our part of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the new agency when it is established recommend to the Minister of the day that aid be given to <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements in this, that or another country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister invite the agency to undertake research or inquiry into various countries where he feels that there might be some national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movement which is in sympathy with the government’s various political philosophies and then decide to give it some aid for what might be called humanitarian purposes but without too much difficulty can be related, one way or another, to purposes with which the Australian community may have some serious disagreement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish also to make a comment on this question of aid to national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well to express sympathy for the aims of some of these <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have seen what I believe is the disgraceful conduct of abstaining on the question of whether the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation should be represented at the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One that concerns me is Australia’s decision to support the right of the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation to speak at the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It reflects this double standard when we are willing to accept under any circumstances the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation with all that it stands for in terms of terrorism, torture and murder and its avowed aims which are the destruction of the State of Israel and the genocide of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation says that it will talk to anyone provided he accepts as a basic tenet that Israel must give in and give way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this decision to support any recognition of the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation is a disgrace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise in this debate only because I think we all respect in many ways the feelings of  Senator Baume  and other honourable senators who have raised this issue of the recognition of the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government either did not have the courage of its convictions or it was completely misled in regard to the voting at the United Nations on the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation where Australia abstained from casting its vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, refers to the growing threats to the future survival of the State of Israel arising, amongst other ways, from inflammatory statements by the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation and other Arab sources that Israel must be destroyed, and also to the increasing financial and military capacity of Middle East areas to mount substantially larger military campaigns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation has been recognised by the Arab countries as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does the Australian Government condemn the stated policy of the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation to eliminate Israel as a sovereign independent State? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation is not a state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a case of recognising the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister for Foreign Affairs believe that the Australian Government could, with any useful effect, call on the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation to renounce violence and terrorism so that a basis for peaceful negotiation with Israel could be established? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation and everybody else know where we stand on the question of violence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to his answer today in which he stated that he would welcome from the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation a statement that it is prepared to co-exist with Israel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation knows where we stand on it, as I think does every decent nation in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did it come to his notice by Press photograph following the appearance of Arafat, the representative of the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation, at the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York, that at the time Arafat addressed the Assembly he was wearing a holster for a gun and that in the course of his speech he stated- apparently metaphorically- that he was bearing a gun. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the Leader of the Government in the Senate seen the report in the Australian’ newspaper of today’s date that the Prime Minister has indicated to the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation that its representatives should be able to visit Australia soon? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the terrorists are from countries which already have diplomatic missions in Australia will the Minister urge on the Prime Minister the view that these missions are better able to publicise the views which might be expressed by the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation and that this group, which has been internationally condemned, has no place in this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Max Wechsler also relates that there are contracts between the Socialist Workers League and various revolutionary and terrorist groups throughout the world, and that the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation and the Japanese Red Army have had personal contact with members or supporters of the Socialist Workers League. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Weschler  believed that the Government was not concerned- as from the action it took with response to the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation and the Popular Front for the <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> of Palestine and the demonstration against the Shah or Iran, he saw that the Government was concerned about those matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Palestinian Arab people, in expressing itself through the armed Palestine revolution, rejects  every  solution that is a substitute for complete <span class="highlight">liberation</span> of Palestine, and rejects all plans that aim at the settlement of the Palestine issue or its internationalisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are criticised when we say we make contact with the other side, but when there is a fighting situation such as there is in so many countries of the world today- not the old wars that we grew up with, where half the world was on one side and almost half on the other- where we have wars of <span class="highlight">liberation</span>, and where we see guerrilla movements, it is quite impossible to be blaming one side and not talking to the other, isolating it, and driving it into a corner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What honourable senators do not seem to appreciate is that the very forces, the very people, the very leadership they now condemn were our allies in World War II, and that the Vietminh, which constituted the <span class="highlight">liberation</span> armies of Vietnam, were the people who collaborated with the South-East Asian command. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If  Senator Sim  is prepared to open his mind and his eyes and become intelligent he will find that former  President  Eisenhower in his memoirs said that if there had been an election at the time when the Geneva Agreement was signed the forces of Ho Chi Minh who was a communist and a popular <span class="highlight">liberation</span> leader, would have won 80 per cent of the popular support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The history of Vietnam has been told so many times: That Vietnam was once an independent country, a country very proud of its independence; that in the 1840s it became a French colony; that the resistance to the French colonialists did not cease through all the time it was a colony; and that when the Vichy French collapsed and did not fight, when the Japanese invaded Indo-China in 1942, our allies in resistance to the Japanese, the comrades in arms of Australian soldiers, were the Vietnamese National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front, the Vietminh under the leadership of Ho Chi Minh, who carried on the fight as our allies against the Japanese while the French colonial governors collaborated with the Japanese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the first papers that was issued by the United States Administration concerning its intervention in Vietnam referred to the weapons that had been captured from the forces fighting for the so-called Vietcong, the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front, and only 2V4 per cent of those weapons were manufactured in a country with a communist government, such as the Soviet Union, China or Czechoslovakia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The remainder of the arms either were primitive, home-made weapons, weapons which had been captured from the corrupt junta in Saigon, or weapons which had been handed over by the hundreds and thousands of troops in the Saigon army who refused to go on fighting for their corrupt bosses but who went over to the side of the people, the side of the National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Front. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The decision it took- apparently it is alleged to be a compromise between the moderates and extremists, whoever they are; it is sometimes difficult to disentangle them- is to the effect that the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation would be prepared to accept an independent Palestinian state on the west bank of the Jordan as a transitory step towards the complete demolition of the state of Israel and the establishment of one Palestinian state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What they have shown by this decision is that, despite the hopes which had been expressed by some people that there was a movement in the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation towards the acceptance of Israel on reduced borders as a sovereign state, it has now apparently been re-affirmed by all of them that they are still just as determined to destroy Israel as they ever were and that the only purpose that the so-called independent Palestinian state on the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is nothing for humanitarian assistance to national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements in Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At about the same time as that statement was made, one issue of the official paper of the ACFOA Education Unit, the  Development News Digest- I  am using one issue as an example- contained the following articles: Focus on <span class="highlight">Liberation</span>’, ‘Victory in Timor’ by Chris Santos, ‘Peace in Timor’ by Jill Joliffe, <span class="highlight">Liberation</span>’ by Germaine Greer, ‘Aid to <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Movements’, ‘Arukun Land Rights’ and interviews with a number of people including an article on the end of the Australian Development Assistance Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The most recent mail despatch from Saudi Arabia, received on 22 April 1977, did not contain any articles bearing indications of a Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation ‘superfrank’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But the case which is presented by every one of the Arab countries without exception- not one of them has ever said anything to contradict this- and the case which is presented by the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation, which apparently is now accepted as the spokesman for the Palestinians, and most recently by the Palestine National Council, the socalled parliament of the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation, which I regret to say is recognised as a parliament by the Inter-Parliamentary Union, is that the state of Israel has to be destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was meant to be a psychological warfare project against the <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movement in Thailand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The continuing fight for <span class="highlight">liberation</span> by the people of West Irian to a large extent has gone unnoticed due, I believe, to a couple of factors: Firstly, the attempted Indonesian blackout of the area; and secondly, because of our ignorance of the aspirations of our neighbours whom we still see to some extent as fuzzy wuzzys or primitive tribesmen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet changed circumstances have arisen which provide a new context for movements of <span class="highlight">liberation</span> and which made actions like that of the East Timorese possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps the white man is in greater need of <span class="highlight">liberation</span>, in greater need to be freed from fear and liberated from the threat which race and colour discrimination is to our future safety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A further $1,000 is going to the Democratic Republic of East Timor for the purpose of paying rent for buildings and facilities; $ 1,000 is going to the East Timor campaign; $500 is going to the Pacific People’s Action Front; $3,000 is going to the Antiapartheid Campaign; $500 is going to the Squatter’s Campaign in Melbourne; $1,00 is going to the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation; $500 is going to the Stop Omega Campaign; and $1,350 is going to various anti-uranium groups throughout the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As emerges from the Committee’s inquiries, to a very large extent the conflict which took place within the Lebanon was a conflict between members of the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation and other people- indigenous people- living within the Lebanon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation representing a number of Palestinian political organisations of some differing persuasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation itself and every affiliated organisation within the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation- whether it is the El Fatah or  Mr Yasser  Arafat or the much more extreme organisation, the Popular Front for the <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> of Palestine- however they may differ on the methods they would apply to the elimination of the state of Isreal all of them are united in their belief that the State of Israel has no right to exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nonetheless the fact remains that for as long as the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation and the Arab countries continue to say that they will not recognise the existence of that state and that it is their objective to destroy it, I do not believe that one can object in any way to the Israelis continuing to occupy the West Bank and refusing to negotiate with the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As yet, there is nothing clear and unequivocal to this effect in any statement which has been issued by the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation or the other neighbouring Arab countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, I suggest that it should be the goal of those people who are friends of Israel, people who wish well and who do not wish ill to the Arab population of the Middle East, people who are trying to avoid bloodshed and to achieve peace in the area, to do two things: We should be urging on the Arab countries, and by whatever influence we can have on those countries which in turn influence the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation, that there can be no peaceful settlement without their recognising the sovereignty of the state of Israel and its continued existence within secure boundaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proclaimed <span class="highlight">liberation</span> is synonomous with slavery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>From her involvement with various women’s <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements she has been in the forefront of some of this exploitation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throughout the world national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements have suddenly become respectable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a mixture of reasons, including, I think it is fair to say, the genuine humanitarian convictions of people such as  Mr Young,  the present United States Ambassador to the United Nations and probably  Mr Carter  and  Mr Mondale,  the United States feels sympathy for the various national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements in Africa- a sympathy which I do not doubt is accentuated by the fact that those people know that there is a 20 per cent non-white electorate inside the United States of America which would also have some views on this subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such organisations include the Irish Republican Army, the Palestinian <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation, the BaderMeinhof gang and the Ustasha. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the incident for which the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation has claimed credit and about which it actually received the right to speak over the Australian Broadcasting Commission’s national network last night, I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether he will consider the appropriateness of making representations to the appropriate organ of the United Nations to expel or cancel the recognition of the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation as an observer to that body while ever these tactics of terrorism are boasted to be the achievement of the PLO? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was it because it was a supporter of the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be very vocal but increasingly other women’s groups are coming to the fore to oppose the extreme viewpoints put forward by the Women’s Electoral Lobby, Women’s <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> and the radical feminists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A number of honourable senators may some day give information about Gail Cotton and her work with Bill Hartley in support of the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation and its terrorist activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the attention of the Minister to an article in the Melbourne  Age  which stated that Australia had abstained from a United Nations Human Rights Commission vote which declared that Israel was guilty of war crimes and supported Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation military action to gain its objectives, while the United States, Canada and Britain voted against the resolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bombing could have been perpetrated by an organised urban terrorist group such as the Baadar-Meinhof gang, the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation, the Red Brigade, the Japanese Red Army or any of those other extreme groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a highjacking of a plane and I think only last week there was a bombing attack on the United Nations for which a group calling itself ‘Croatian <span class="highlight">Liberation</span>’ or some similar name in fact took and claimed responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They were headed ‘Mothers’ <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> ‘ and urged mothers to leave the home and become part of the paid work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A famous Frenchman said recently that <span class="highlight">liberation</span> of women is freedom to choose between managing their homes and working in an office or factory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It appears to have been published by the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation and circulated in Australia by the Union of Palestinian Workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On top of all this, the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation threatened my life, which was not the most pleasant experience I have ever had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>According to the figures supplied to me by the Research Service of the Parliamentary Library, during the so-called <span class="highlight">liberation</span> war between North Vietnam and South Vietnam China helped the North Vietnamese by giving them $20,000m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Were any Australian aid projects in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam damaged or destroyed by the invading, occupying or withdrawing armed forces of the Chinese People ‘s <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Army? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very interesting indeed to notice that one of the other front runners in the stakes of national <span class="highlight">liberation</span>, the People’s Republic of China, has so far been studiously silent on this issue; studiously silent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our major task in dealing with these issues is to try to avoid these absurdly simple categories to which people have subscribed down through the years; that is, that people are either in favour of the West, which means that they support Smith or Vorster, or they are in favour of <span class="highlight">liberation</span>, which means they support any <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movement or any movement that has the word <span class="highlight">liberation</span>’ in its title, whether it be the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation or the Irish National <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Army. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, under resolution 33/41 of the General Assembly passed on 13 December 1978, all specialised agencies of the United Nations-that is, including the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund- were called on to increase their assistance to national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements recognised by the Organisation of African Unity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last report by UNICEF to the Economic and Social Council, reference is made to assistance to children and mothers cared for by <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This assistance was extended to refugee mothers and children under the auspices of the <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements in Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania and Zambia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, for example, the contribution in 1979-80 to educational, training and cultural assistance to national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements will be only 0.69 per cent of UNESCO’s total budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said on 1 1 September, in answer to another question, that a tiny proportion of the Budget provision of some United Nations agencies which receive Australian Government contributions is used to provide relief to South African refugee mothers and children who are cared for by <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think he asked a question about alleged assistance from the United Nations Children’s Fund to <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements in southern Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an extraordinarily uninformative statement and does not amount at all to any justification for the highly unfortunate, unwarranted and, I would believe, unconscionable decision of the Australian Government, after very large sums of money had been spent on initial preparation for that conference, to abandon it simply because of the prospect of a visit from a Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation delegation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer him to a recent statement by  Mr Farouk  Khaddoumi, head of the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation’s political department, that the Arab oil producing states would use the oil weapon to influence next year’s presidential elections in the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Government assure the Australian people that it would not allow itself in any way to be party to the kind of oil blackmail suggested by the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is worth noting, as it is clear from what the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation leader said, that the PLO has no control over the production or marketing of oil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can see no relationship between the answer I gave, which related to some report that the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation would use oil as a weapon, and whether or not good neighbour countries- OPEC countries- have made some attempt at reciprocal arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that according to an Australian Associated Press-Reuter message from Abu Dhabi yesterday, the  Chairman  of the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation, Yasser Arafat, plans to put proposals later this month to an Arab summit meeting for the use of oil supplies as a political weapon? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the extent that there was any public or private speculation at the time as to why the Congress had been cancelled, let me point out that the reason was apparently the possible attendance at the conference of an observer delegation from  the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Did the Government have knowledge at any stage that a delegation was proposed to be sent from the Palestine <span class="highlight">Liberation</span> Organization? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Government was aware of the provisions of the Rules of Procedure for the Congress which provide for participation in the Congress by delegations of States and by other participants and observers, including observers from organizations that have received a standing invitation from the General Assembly to attend certain United Nations meetings, observers from national <span class="highlight">liberation</span> movements invited to the Congress, observers from United Nations organizations and related agencies, inter-governmental organizations and non-governmental organizations, and individual experts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
