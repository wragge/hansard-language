<ul>
  <li>
    <p>1 suggest to the honourable member that it is Opposition supporters who are doing all the <span class="highlight">protesting</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They may not have been <span class="highlight">protesting</span> to the honourable member for Wakefield but they have been <span class="highlight">protesting</span> to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent years I have written two or three letters to the Chinese Foreign Minister and two or three letters to the Russian Foreign Minister <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against and arguing against the conduct of those nations in nuclear testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they wish to continue <span class="highlight">protesting</span> in the normal way, they will be quite entitled to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government support the Seamen’s Union’s ban on French ships entering and leaving Australian ports as a means of <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against the French nuclear tests in the Pacific? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are <span class="highlight">protesting</span> now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when the honourable member for Hunter sees 50 or 100 people gathered together - and this is a failing also of the Australian Labor Party - he suggests that it is the whole Australian community <span class="highlight">protesting</span> and that the whole Australian community supports him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no good the honourable member <span class="highlight">protesting</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know this because of a number of telegrams I have received from southern meatworks <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about the concession that was given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Prime Minister has received the reports and noted the further march by 3,000 <span class="highlight">protesting</span> farmers in Perth, will he tell the House what specific action he intends to take to end the economic deep freeze in the countryside contrasting with the Treasurer’s overheating? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700408_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have also received copies of letters from fruit growing organisations <span class="highlight">protesting</span> vigorously against the decision of the Loxton District Council to favour Dartmouth dam alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700408_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Adelaide  (Mr Hurford)  spent much time <span class="highlight">protesting</span> that South Australia needs water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700408_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what we are <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about today and tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 24th February a petition bearing 115 signatures and <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against the slaughter of kangaroos was presented to the Australian Embassy in Brussels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said: When not <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about the possible loss nf professional freedom the less well informed members of the profession, and this seems to be a majority, protest that the present direct doctorpatient financial relationship is hallowed by centuries, if not millennia of sacred tradition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When not <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about the possible loss of professional freedom the less well informed members of the profession, and this seems to be a majority, protest that the present director doctorpatient financial relationship is hallowed by centuries if not millennia of sacred tradition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, there is no monopoly of a desire for peace amongst those people who are <span class="highlight">protesting</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He asked the Minister for External Affairs  (Mr McMahon)  to make an example by approaching  President  Nixon and <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about the death of 4 young people at Kent University a day or 2 ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there any agitation in Moscow from this peace front, <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against the use of Soviet troops in those theatres? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the various State Ministers be <span class="highlight">protesting</span> if they had not reason to believe that the Australian Minerals Council would have been continuing its discussions in February? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would have been no basis for <span class="highlight">protesting</span> that we have to balance the water grants to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Western Australia the amount of time some school children would spend travelling each day would be equivalent to the amount which some honourable members are <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about spending weekly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, for example, an honourable member <span class="highlight">protesting</span> at the disgraceful level of pensions in this Budget will be accused of wishing to cut back on, say, defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had numerous letters, telegrams and personal calls to my office <span class="highlight">protesting</span> at the inadequacy of the 5()c a week increase in pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is here <span class="highlight">protesting</span> on behalf of a worker, some poor innocent lad who is a plumber’s apprentice, a builder’s labourer or somebody who has committed an offence.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is using every form of intimidation under the guise of law and order to try to stop people from <span class="highlight">protesting</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation wanted photographs of these sinister people who were <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against the meagre increase in pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It shows a Liberal senator’s daughter being bundled out of the Sydney Town Hall because she was <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about the Communist Party Dissolution Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what I am <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about tonight, because I feel that this is the major health problem for every nation, particularly a nation involved in a destructive war as we’ are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#debate-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A department necessarily, if it is to be sympathetic and flexible, must have a certain degree of discretion; otherwise the letter of the law, against which the honourable member quite rightly was <span class="highlight">protesting</span> a few moments ago, becomes inflexible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They can lie on the tarmac or do many other things in <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about whether their needs have been adequately considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a speech to this House last June he said he is not too happy at the fact that every time a movie is shown in which sexual exploits occur he or his Department receives hundreds of letters from <span class="highlight">protesting</span> parents, yet do not receive any letters at all about violence in movies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not only the professors, the pedagogues and the politicians who have been <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about this situation but also the Press. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make this request for the simple reason that I sit near the honourable member for Sturt and when I start <span class="highlight">protesting</span> I am called to order by the  Speaker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that only a lack of understanding can explain the fact that State politicians, who claim they are short of resources to service their own urban areas, are not <span class="highlight">protesting</span> a proposal to hand over an equity worth over $100m to the lessees in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have in front of me a copy of a letter sent by the honourable secretary of the Ringston-Narrabundah Returned Services Club in Canberra <span class="highlight">protesting</span> at its rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again in America in 1966, in the case of Bond versus Floyd, a coloured man was convicted of a crime of <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against the Vietnam war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are decent law abiding citizens who are <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against an obnoxious law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These days people are <span class="highlight">protesting</span> and demonstrating against what they claim are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless the Government can provide some legitimate and reasonable excuse for adjourning the Parliament on that day, I believe the Opposition is carrying out its responsibility to the people of this country by <span class="highlight">protesting</span> in the only way we can protest when the Government introduces a motion of this nature to suspend the 11 o’clock rule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 rise to participate briefly in this debate to add my views to those of honourable members on this side of the House who are <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against this Liberal-Country Party Government’s method of tariff making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710428_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some time now it has been known to all authorities, in particular to the Minister for Civil Aviation  (Senator Cotton)  and the Department of Civil Aviation, that residents in my electorate of Swan and in adjacent electorates have been <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about the noise nuisance associated with the Perth airport, which is situated in the heart of a growing residential area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have in my possession a petition from a number of growers in South Australia <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against the Government’s action in imposing an excise duty on wine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During July, while Labor members, together with unionists and left wing students, were <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about the internal affairs of South Africa - the vast majority of them never having seen the situation there - T spent 3 weeks moving freely throughout that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are <span class="highlight">protesting</span> because the servicing requirements will add very significantly to the costs people will have to pay for land in those areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are so many matters which could reasonably be said to come under this head that I. am almost forced into the position of the honourable member for Wills in <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about those terrible people who cut down the speaking times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the right honourable gentleman indicate any statement by himself or his Ministers <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against America’s policy on this matter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the source of that potential danger comes from the Government’s present policy towards Africa which can best be described as a low profile, middle course policy; a policy of polite restrained relations with the black African countries and quite an intimate relationship with South Africa, <span class="highlight">protesting</span> at the same time as we properly do that we find apartheid abhorrent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711110_reps_27_hor75/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may have been 3,000 or 4,000 people in the great underground parking area at the Miranda Fair <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against the proposal to establish the airport at Towra Point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the members who are <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about its being overthrown then have said it was immutable - that it should stand like the laws of the Medes and Persians? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I issued a statement <span class="highlight">protesting</span> at the increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we stop <span class="highlight">protesting</span>, that Post Office will be closed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When there were particular instances in my electorate 1 sent telegrams to the PostmasterGeneral <span class="highlight">protesting</span> strongly about the closure of those post offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this case he wished to contrast his own attitude of ‘responsible concern’ about apartheid with the alleged irresponsibility of those who were <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against the  proposed  sporting tours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth has been forced, <span class="highlight">protesting</span> and reluctant, to take an increasing role in the planning of rail and road networks, health and the whole field of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yesterday, people in my office in this building drew my attention to 2 bundles of letters which had been received <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about the health insurance scheme - one from, I think, Bundaberg and the other from Gympie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his <span class="highlight">protesting</span> too much I think the honourable member reveals why the Government is pressing this Bill through with indecent haste- that is, that the system, as the honourable member for Port Adelaide pointed out, works against certain Labor electorates with the percentage of informal votes, and what is being dressed up in the cause of a very democratic and just procedure is really something that Labor wants to alter in some ways because it can see some advantage to itself in these alterations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  endeavoured to hurry this Bill through this Parliament 5 minutes before the adjournment during the dying hours of the previous session and, due to the acceptance of a motion to adjourn discussion on this Bill, people are now beginning to realise the full ramifications of this legislation as is being shown by the vast amount of correspondence <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against this Bill arriving on members’ desks daily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Shortly after the passage of that legislation I realised that the then Department of Trade and Industry, and particularly its head, would want some sort of an all day sucker to keep it quiet and to keep it from <span class="highlight">protesting</span> too much about the private organisation bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am not suggesting to the Committee that it is beyond possibility that in very extraordinary circumstances it might be necessary for a government at some stage in the future to do it, but what I am <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about and what the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  protested about is a blanket Executive warrant being given by this Bill to the government of the day by a blunt action to close down any one of the stock exchanges of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The facts, as I understand them, were that a gentleman was alleged to have brought some friends home to his house and invited them to have intercourse with his wife, telling them that they were not to be put off by her protests because that was her way and that she really enjoyed <span class="highlight">protesting</span> and the act of intercourse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was amazed to listen to the honourable member for Robertson  (Mr Cohen)  this evening complaining that members of the Opposition originally were critical on the one hand of the Regional Employment Development scheme and yet on the other they supported the principals of our parties in the States in <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against its cessation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I recently lodged with the Consul at the Russian Embassy a petition containing 2500 signatures <span class="highlight">protesting</span> at the harsh treatment meted out to Soviet Jewry, decrying the discrimination against them and highlighting the consistent refusal of the Russian authorities to grant exit visas to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that perhaps the major reason why he is <span class="highlight">protesting</span> at this given time is the event that is going to take place in New South Wales on 1 May when the people of that State will be going to the ballot box to cast their votes for a State government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We saw on the ABC television news on Thursday night- no doubt it is kept on videotape- the  Chairman  of the Commission <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against political comment by the Prime Minister of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
