<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Government in the Senate aware that hundreds of thousands of workers throughout Australia today stopped work and that workers and pensioners attended mass rallies <span class="highlight">protesting</span> at the injustices and economic discrimination of the Budget? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the Prime Minister has written to  President  Nixon <span class="highlight">protesting</span> at  Mr Nixon’s  failure to give him advance warning of the announcement of the President’s proposed visit to Peking? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make the point that the draft card burners are not so much <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against the quality of this law as they are objecting to the rule of law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hear the law and order gang opposite <span class="highlight">protesting</span>, but we saw what its attitudes and its sympathisers did in the United States in connection with students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, months ago I wrote to the Auditor-General <span class="highlight">protesting</span> that the action purported to be made by the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  to allow members of Parliament a travel allowance quite apart from the electorate allowance allowed by statute was illegal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am delighted to hear you are at last considering <span class="highlight">protesting</span> to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights over the violation of human rights, but perhaps you should be warned of the fate of those who live in glass houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  protests suggested that there might have been some guilt which he thought could be overcome by his <span class="highlight">protesting</span> and shouting in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many years I have been <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about the downgrading of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When they have stopped <span class="highlight">protesting</span> - if I may use the microphone to over-ride them and to continue - I shall point to something such as the Bien Hoa hospital which none of them has visited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wherever  Mr Wilson,  the Prime Minister of Great Britain, has gone in recent weeks, he has found big demonstrations by farmers <span class="highlight">protesting</span> at the position of the primary industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I then wrote to the Stock Exchange in Perth, <span class="highlight">protesting</span> that I was given no chance in the original issue through Blacks handling of thecase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I again wroteto the Stock Exchange <span class="highlight">protesting</span> their attitude, and my protect was once again rejected - copy of this is also attached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about the late delivery of Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No, it is concerned with this Bill because I am strongly <span class="highlight">protesting</span> that this Bill is not taking the precautions which it ought to take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about the Bill, she points out that her committee expresses its concern that the Act, while providing a subsidy on capital expenditure, makes no provision for subsidy on the maintenance of the assets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think wc all recall the full page advertisements which appeared in the daily Press <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against this decision of the Tariff Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that this is a striking indictment and condemnation of the view of those people who organised a disruption of industry for the purpose of <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against a parliamentary budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Wine and Brandy Co-operative Producers Association of Australia Incorporated has sent a letter of 2 foolscap pages from Nuriootpa, <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against the increased excise on wine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only the pensioners of this country are <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about the Government’s actions and its niggardly treatment of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teachers and parents are <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about the inadequacies of our education system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well as the sections of the community to which I have referred, our artists and writers are now <span class="highlight">protesting</span> and are demanding the right to employment in their own industry, in their own profession, in their own country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the people who are <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against the Government’s policies and against its inability to suggest remedies for the present situation which faces farmers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If my proposals were adopted the demonstrating and <span class="highlight">protesting</span> by pensioners before a Budget is brought down would be eliminated and these people would not be subjected to such ignominy and humiliation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to say a few words about Government Business taking precedence over General Business, because from the time I entered this chamber I have been <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against the taking away of rights of individual senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is it very tame cat in its approach to <span class="highlight">protesting</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This followed upon Tuesday’s meeting of unionists <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against the Federal Budget, which is now under consideration in Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s no one left <span class="highlight">protesting</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of preface, I refer to a report in the ‘Canberra Times’ of 19th March of a meeting by the Minister for the Interior with a deputation representing the Australian Capital Territory Study Group on Environmental Quality, which was <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against the erection of a television tower and restaurant in the Black Mountain area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710401_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people are prosecuted today for burning their draft cards and others are not.. Is it any wonder that there are people today who are <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against the unfairness of these laws and the administration of them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is manifesting itself not only here but also in the United States of America, the United Kingdom, many parts of Europe and even in Japan, where the youth are <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against their lack of national purpose and their lack of something in which to believe and for which to strive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe, in the first place, that the reason why the youth of this country are disillusioned and are <span class="highlight">protesting</span> lies in our political system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are <span class="highlight">protesting</span> in various ways to show that they are not satisfied with the way in which our society is operating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evans was convicted although <span class="highlight">protesting</span> that the murderer was Christie, who had given evidence against him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is known that the people who have been standing outside Parliament House for weeks <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against the Vietnam war and who want to go peaceably through the streets of the capital cities do not own the television stations, the newspapers or the radio stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have sensed as I have been saying that that  Senator Wheeldon  has been <span class="highlight">protesting</span> that that is not his point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If people were <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about the Vietnam war, or whatever else it was, and had the same number of people in the streets as they do at the time of the Moomba Festival and they were stopping people from passing by, it could be said that this is unreasonable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there might be another person who says: ‘Here is an assembly that is <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about apartheid, or something of that nature, and he may say: ‘Well, I agree with that, and I will go along with it, too.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those people might be just there <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about what is happening in South Africa, and they might invite that person to join them, so he does so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government take note of the fact that a Government senator has presented a petition <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against the weapons used by Australia and her allies in the Vietnam war? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Prime Minister written to  President  Nixon, <span class="highlight">protesting</span> at his failure to give  Mr McMahon  advance warning of the announcement of his proposed visit to Peking? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711026_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no detailed information of any action that has been taken by honourable senators or other people in <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against the increased price of flour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How far should we go in <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about this matter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711208_senate_27_s50/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Amalgamated Postal Workers’ Union of Australia has received telegrams from Unions all over the world representing 20 million Public Service and Post Office employees <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against the McMahon Government’s Bill amending the Public Service Arbitration Act to provide for greater penal powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Webster  refers to an incident which occurred some time ago when many Australians were <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against the- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was pushed to a car <span class="highlight">protesting</span> that he was not the man whom they were seeking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was <span class="highlight">protesting</span>, it seemed to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was obvious that the young man was <span class="highlight">protesting</span> as he was being led to the car and entering the car. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not hear what was said and I do not pretend that I know what was said, but  I  did hear him <span class="highlight">protesting</span> at that time that there was no warrant for his arrest and that he was not Wood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Minister in charge of Racing,  Sir Gordon  Chalk, K.B.E., by the Licensed North Queensland Racing Association Bookmakers <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against the action and attitude of the Queensland Bookmakers Council; 7. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Comment on the Queensland Bookmakers Council in the Cairns ‘Post’ of 14th January 1972; 8, A letter from the Mackay Bookmakers Association to the North Queeusland Racing Association <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about being forced or bound in any way to  join the Queensland Bookmakers Council; 9, A new document - a statement of receipts and payments for the period from 1st October 1969 to 31st October 1971, duly audited by B.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who now is <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about that action? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The demonstrators were <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against Communist domination of Croatia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of his problems, oddly enough, is that the Communist Party in Croatia - this is something to which 1 recommend honourable senators opposite should pay more than passing attention - has been <span class="highlight">protesting</span> so much about the economic and political rape of the country that Tito’s main problem has not been with Croatian insurgents and terrorists and this sort of people; his main problem has been with the Communist Party in Croatia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On this issue, let me just say that on Australia Day, 26th January, the Aborigines erected a number of tents on the lawns in front of Parliament House for the purpose of <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against deprivation of Aboriginal land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The actions of Australian citizens or organisations in <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against the carrying out by the French Government of atmospheric nuclear tests in the Pacific have to be understood in the light of the open disregard by France of the ruling of the International Court of Justice and the relative effects on the Australian environment of fall-out from French and Chinese tests (see the answer given in the Senate on IS May 1973 to Question No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have to inform honourable senators that the Principal Parliamentary Reporter has received a letter from the Government Printer <span class="highlight">protesting</span> at the quality of material sent to him for incorporation in  Hansard  during the sitting on Thursday, 21 October. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what the Opposition is <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 25 February the  President  of the Haasts Bluff Council sent a telegram to the Prime Minister <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against the action of the Government as a repudiation of its election policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that they are the operative words, and that is why I am <span class="highlight">protesting</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the Minister for Social Security received a letter from the NOW Centre in Melbourne <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about her withdrawal of the welfare rights officer grant from the Federation of Italian Labourers, Emigrants and Families? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Minister receive a telegram from the Australian Council of Furniture Manufacturers, an employer organisation, and the Federated Furnishing Trade Society of Australasia, an employee organisation, <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against this decision and offering to pay the air fares and any accommodation required by the commissioners? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that  Senator Harradine,  in <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against that and saying that there is a section of the trade union movement which would regard that as an inducement to anarchy, is not speaking the language that we know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That person could be, for example, a student <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against some injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That person could be a consumer <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against dishonest business practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We had very oppressive legislation put through this Parliament some months ago in the form of the Commonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) Bill to prevent Commonwealth employees from even <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about the conditions under which they have to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me that is a travesty of justice, a travesty of democracy, which leads to the very thing about which churchmen in Queensland are <span class="highlight">protesting</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Daily Telegraph  said that the Liberal Party was <span class="highlight">protesting</span>, but the distribution commissioners made an in depth study and they were standing firm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I remember <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about this matter last year, in this Bill or in recent months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs aware that 40 Aborigines were recently expelled by the Yarra Bay Sailing Club in Sydney and that the expulsions were carried out because some Aborigines had taken up a petition <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about an alleged assault on an Aborigine by an officer of the club? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they had wanted to protest against the infringement of States’ rights or, more importantly in my view, the gross and scandalous infringements of the rights of the individual and the denial of the most fundamental principles of AngloAustralian jurisprudence, they should have started <span class="highlight">protesting</span> 25 years ago about the Atomic Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without documenting the situation any further, I simply say that when we sat on the celebrated Townley Committee- the Minister knows about this, although probably he was not quite as involved as others of us on the Committee were with our different attitudes- we learned that it would be completely wrong for these people who are <span class="highlight">protesting</span> to claim that they are being persecuted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Tonkin  has gone on record <span class="highlight">protesting</span> vigorously about the dangers for the River Murray if a paper pulp mill is built near Wodonga. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since April this year, the political detainees have been <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against these persecutionary measures, staging sitdown protests after each visit because prison authorities have refused to discuss the issue of foodstuff brought in by the families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It cannot afford to pay any more and it is no good <span class="highlight">protesting</span> to this Government because it will not take any notice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for this reason that we join with all those other people in the community who are <span class="highlight">protesting</span> at the cuts in the Commonwealth subsidy for this important, humane and vital area of home help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Council on the Ageing, the Pensioners’ Federation and Professor Henderson as well as local government bodies are all <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about these proposed changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Social Security field officer does not get you there is a strong chance that the law will, and if you become politicised and show your disapproval of the way this Government is handling your life by <span class="highlight">protesting</span> and marching there is a strong chance ASIO will have you on file. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In common with a number of honourable senators, I have received many letters <span class="highlight">protesting</span> at this piece of legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I know that it is of no use our standing here and <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against this measure, because we are not going to get the support of honourable senators opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One example was that of a mature aged trainee teacher, not a member of the Communist Party or any of its multifarious offshoots, in West Germany whose offences apparently were twofold: First, to organise his fellow trainee teachers when they were threatened with a salary deduction, to threaten a strike- not actually to carry it out- against the authorities; and, secondly, to sign in company with a number of other people who were communists- I repeat that apparently he was not- an open letter <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against the violation of the Constitution in Chile. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Ryan  keeps <span class="highlight">protesting</span> that the people I name are satisfactory, representative and the sort of people who ought to be on the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These people are <span class="highlight">protesting</span> because they feel the film belittles the concept of all that the Polish people believe in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>But the Polish people are <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about the manner in which their national anthem is prostituted in this film and things like that which grate on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Having been approached today, quite spontaneously, by dried fruit producers- people whose names were not known to me, people I have never spoken to before- who were <span class="highlight">protesting</span> not about the intention in the four Bills which are before the Senate but about the fact that the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  has failed adequately to consult with the producers concerned, I feel that I must register a protest on their behalf in addition to the protest that I have already stated on behalf of members of the Senate collectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-91-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, I would like to say only this: All those progressives, all those people who continuously speak about human beings and human rights, all those people who so recently marched in the streets <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about the cruelty of war- any war- have forgotten that wars are still going on in which the same people, the same human beings, are being killed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that at the Blackburn North Baptist Church on 1 1 August and again at the Robert Blackwood Hall at Monash University on 12 August this year, Australian citizens <span class="highlight">protesting</span> against the Indonesian invasion and continuing presence in East Timor were kicked and punched by staff attached to the Indonesian Embassy, resulting in injuries to these citizens? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is a fine line between the rights of a person to protest about some government decision that they object to and the rights and privileges of people in the community to be able to go about their normal day’s work while they are objecting and <span class="highlight">protesting</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It did not consult them in that it brought forward the proposals for this legislation at the National Labour Consultative Council, at a time when it well knew that the peak union councils would not be represented because they were <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about a specific failure of the Government to communicate and consult with them on  the proclamation of another very controversial piece of legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why then has not  Senator Webster  issued a statement <span class="highlight">protesting</span> about the naming of these five people and, indeed, three or four other people, in another report tabled yesterday in the New South Wales Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
