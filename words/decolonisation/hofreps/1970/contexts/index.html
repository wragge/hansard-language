<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I refer him to a number of resolutions adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 14 December 1972, dealing with <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> and racial discrimination, which Australia supported and voted for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister knows very well however that in the case of voluntary <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> as opposed to revolutionary and enforced <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span>, the key decisions have to be made by the colonial authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I were to conduct a survey in this House and ask all honourable members what has been the dominating feature of the 20th century, I suppose I might be told it was the holocausts of World Wars I and II; but I suspect that it may be the view of many of us that it has been <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span>, the breaking up of empires where dominions swept across whole continents, with new nations came into being. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this conference was to formulate a constructive program of peaceful action to facilitate and hasten the process of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> and the elimination of apartheid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those of us who have had such experience know that <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> in other parts of the world has been both depressing and disastrous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia rejoined the Committee in January 1973 because resumption of membership was consistent with the Government’s policy of demonstrating Australia’s continuing concern for the problems of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-36-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This change of regime has sparked off a process of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> involving the dismantling of the last of the great Western European empires. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is already clear that the present status of Timor as an overseas province of Portugal will change as a result of the process of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span>, which is expected to get under way in one or two years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, in our attitudes towards the <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> process in Timor we have a record to uphold; and to ignore the fate of this territory, in spite of its smallness and strategic unimportance, would be to risk our diplomatic integrity among the many small nations of the South Pacific area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first of these parties, however, favours an interim period of some form of association with Portugal while the second, which is more radical in its outlook, favours full independence after a minimum period of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The positive course for both Australia and Indonesia would be to accept the challenge of helping the process of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> in these Portuguese territories, preferably in a cooperative effort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For cultural, ethnic and historical reasons an integration of the territory into Indonesia would represent valid <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> and the most natural source to that end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We support a measured and deliberate process of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> in Portuguese Timor through arrangements leading to an internationally acceptable act of selfdetermination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation which I now introduce- this Bill and the next 4 Bills which I shall move be read a second time- is historic for Papua New Guinea, for Australia, and for the European civilisation from which we Australians spring, for this is almost the last episode in the great postwar, post-imperial exercise of European <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our view, the program mapped out at Macao, providing for steady forward movement towards <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> and free elections for a constituent assembly, went a long way towards the objectives we support for the territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nonetheless, the Government understands that Portugal is to make an attempt to retrieve some lost ground by sending a negotiating team with a view to persuading Fretilin and UDT to stop fighting and to agree to negotiate new arrangements among the Timorese parties for orderly <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reality is that we should have been commenting, if only amongst ourselves, on the changes this would have wrought in Portuguese Timor, on a policy of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span>, a policy shown in Angola and Mozambique and soon to be shown in East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He says that all the leaders were in Macao, but I doubt whether the Fretilin Party was participating actively there- providing for steady forward movement towards <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of great regret to all the governments that the process which was being worked out for the <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> of Portuguese Timor, self-determination of the territory in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants of the territory, has come unstuck. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Of course the situation in metropolitan Portugal has made the process of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> of the Portuguese Empire- the world’s oldest- particularly difficult in Angola and now in Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to do all we can to see that there is an orderly <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> and a proper self-determination in Portuguese Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throughout the period leading up to the events which have followed the show of force by the Timorese Democratic Union on 10 August the Government has been very much aware of the difficulties which were likely to accompany the <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> process in Portuguese Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We welcome the <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> program for Portuguese Timor, known as the Macao program, which was promulgated on 10 July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The process of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> of Portuguese Timor was thus very delicate and the prospects were always that it would run into difficulty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United Nations <span class="highlight">Decolonisation</span> Committee- the Committee of Twenty-four- has not met to discuss recent events in Timor, but  Dr Santos  has discussed possible action with members of its Bureau. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to see an end to the situation where rival factions are destroying each other and the chance of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> in an orderly manner and self-determination in a proper manner in that territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I endorse the Bills and the Opposition supports them, I have to note that I was somewhat disappointed that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in his speech on this legislation spent so much time on selfcongratulatory language about the role of the Australian Labor Party in allegedly decolonising Papua New Guinea and that by his incorporation in  Hansard  of lengthy statements from 1970 he proffered the oft-quoted view that it was he, as the then Leader of the Opposition, who really brought about this <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At first sight these proposals would appear to bear some relation to an earlier program of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> announced by the Government of Portugal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the honourable member that there was a very real forum in which this matter could have been raised when he was in government, not just at the United Nations General Assembly but at the Committee of Twenty-Four, which is the committee on <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span>, when it met in July of 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government still believe, as he stated on 20 July, that ‘the broad requirements for a satisfactory process of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> in East Timor have not been met1? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Journalistic speculation aside, it is a matter of record that the  President  and I agreed that <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> should proceed on the basis of self-determination, that is, in accordance with the wishes of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Dutch had to quit West Irian and when the British had to dispose of Borneo and now that the Portuguese have abandoned Timor they have bungled every question of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> in our region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1973 Australia has played an important role on the <span class="highlight">Decolonisation</span> Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the events that have occurred in Portuguese Timor since August of last year Australia has witnessed perhaps the worst example of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> since the process began in its modern context after the Second World War. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be recalled that it was on 20 July this year that the Foreign Minister described the process of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> in Timor as unsatisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the circumstances Australia cannot regard the broad requirements for a satisfactory process of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> as having been met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of raising the matter in his speech to the United Nations <span class="highlight">Decolonisation</span> Committee in September, he chose to ignore the issue of East Timor entirely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-21-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 26 August 1975 the former Prime Minister made it quite clear in this House that Australia would refuse to participate in a peace-keeping role in East Timor and would not co-operate with the <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> of that territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the coalition parties had adhered steadfastly to the set of attitudes with which they had become identified before the <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> process began in earnest and before South Africa was forced to leave the organisation, Australia’s membership of the Commonwealth might indeed have become uncomfortable for us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United Nations Committee on <span class="highlight">Decolonisation</span>, in its report of 10 August, welcomed the initiatives taken by the Government and noted with satisfaction the Government’s policy of assuring the political, social and economic development of the Cocos people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> process was stimulated by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But he failed to note that every case examined by him derives from the failures of the Western powers in the <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each of the problems is the direct outcome of Western failure in <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>France, the United States and Australia, prevented an orderly <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> process in Vietnam and produced, therefore, a generation of war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reference has been made to the U.N. <span class="highlight">Decolonisation</span> Committee, whose report was brought down and debated in New York in the last 24 hours or so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
