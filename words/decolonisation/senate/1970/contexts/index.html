<ul>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Decolonisation</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this conference was to formulate a constructive program of peaceful action to facilitate and hasten the process of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> and the elimination of apartheid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is not a party principal to the <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> of Portuguese Timor but it is concerned that in that process the best interests of the people of the territory should be of paramount consideration, and Australia has always acted with that viewpoint in mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that it would be helpful to comment further at this stage on what is obviously a delicate and difficult situation, beyond saying that it remains the Government’s strong hope that the political forces in the territory can compose their differences to the extent that they can co-operate peacefully in its further <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our view, the program mapped out at Macao, providing for steady forward movement towards <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> and free elections for a constituent assembly, went a long way towards the objectives we support for the territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nonetheless, the Government understands that Portugal is to make an attempt to retrieve some lost ground by sending a negotiating team with a view to persuading Fretilin and UDT to stop fighting and to agree to negotiate new arrangements among the Timorese parties for orderly <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this is almost the last episode in the great post-war, post-imperial exercise of European <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For this is almost the last episode in the great post-war, post-imperial exercise of European <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Interest has also been shown in the matter by the United Nations, and this culminated in the Government’s invitation to the United Nations to send to Cocos a Visiting Mission from the Committee of Twenty-Four- the ‘<span class="highlight">Decolonisation</span>’ Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister assure the Senate that Australia will support any Portuguese initiative and request which would assist in the <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> of East Timor based on the principle of self-determination and free from Indonesian intervention? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will support any proposals which we consider will lead towards <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> of Timor and the right to self-determination of the Timorese people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These developments bear out the Government’s long and firmly held view that the best means of resolving the problems posed by the <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> of Timor is by talks between the political parties in the colony. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would urge all parties to put behind them the acrimony that has developed over the past few months and to join the Government of Portugal in talks aimed at reaching a solution that would permit the restoration of peace and order and a revival of the process of peaceful <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It reflects, above all, the immaturity of Timor’s own aspiring political leaders, who in less than eighteen months have succeeded in wrecking Portugal’s <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> program, sharply polarising political opinions through the territory, and finally plunging the territory into violent civil war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fretilin has cetainly now said that it continues to recognise Portuguese sovereignty and the right of Portugal to preside over the <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in this situation of drift, of Fretilin’s refusal to accept that UDT or Apodeti has anything further to contribute to the <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> process, and of Portugal ‘s regrettable inability to reassert its authority in the territory, that we view the various policy pronouncements, newspaper reports and the like from Jakarta and Timor itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 2 Foreign Ministers, in their communique, were also reported to have agreed that in the implementation of the <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> of Portuguese Timor it would be essential to safeguard the legitimate interests of the countries in the region, particularly Indonesia’s interest as the nearest neighbouring country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that the talks now foreshadowed will lead to the restoration of a <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> program like that agreed earlier at Bacan in which the claims of all political parties could be satisfactorily decided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The joint communique expresses the support of the Governments of Portugal and Indonesia for the ‘principles of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> as enunciated in the pertinent resolutions of the United Nations’ and for the ‘scrupulous safeguarding of the principle of respect for the will of the people of Portuguese Timor’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The communique notes the 2 Foreign Ministers’ agreement that ‘fundamental responsibility for the <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> of Portuguese Timor’ lies with Portugal which is to pledge itself to the ‘speedy and orderly implementation of the act of self determination by the people of Portuguese Timor’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was further agreed that there should, ‘at the earliest possible time’, be a ‘meeting between Portugal and all the political parties of Portuguese Timor’ aimed at ‘ending armed strife and bringing about a peaceful and orderly process of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The communique noted agreement that in the process of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> it would be essential ‘to safeguard the legitimate interests of the countries of the region, particularly the interests of Indonesia as the closest neighbouring country’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs aware that a special committee of the United Nations dealing with <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> last year decided to send a mission to investigate the situation in East Timor? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We became the guests of the Portuguese authorities who had begun the process of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span>, preparing the people for the act of self-determination and for independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the subsequent period of approximately 15 months the Portuguese authorities in East Timor began a process of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In October 1974, only 6 months after the people of Timor had been given the opportunity to be involved in the process of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span>, the Indonesian Security Council decided to set about the process of undermining and subverting the nationalist and independence movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>accordingly Australia appreciates Indonesia’s concern over the future of the territory and shares its belief that voluntary union of Portuguese Timor (with Indonesia) on the basis of an internationally accepted act of selfdetermination would seem to serve the objective of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> and at the same time the interest of stability in the region?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nations <span class="highlight">Decolonisation</span> Committee for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One was to ensure that the Portuguese authorities who still hold legal responsibility for the territory were given resources to assist in the policy of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Angola we have witnessed nothing less than an outrage against the process of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> as it has been accepted internationally for more than a decade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#debate-65">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Winspeare-Guicciardi) and to the United Nations <span class="highlight">Decolonisation</span> Committee for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-69-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They invited a sub-committee of the Committee of Twenty-Four- the so-called <span class="highlight">Decolonisation</span> Committee of the United Nations- to send a mission to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the other document which was referred to by the Minister in his reply- he said that it was a document entitled ‘The Process of <span class="highlight">Decolonisation</span> in East Timor’- is a document which the Minister himself said is a publication issued by the Indonesian Department of Information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Indonesian spokesman,  Mr Malik,  in a reply to the Committee of Twenty Four of the United Nations concerned with <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> said on 12 June 1975: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My delegation hopes that the process of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> in Portuguese Timor will be carried out with the broadest participation of all segments of the indigenous population on a non-discriminatory basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fair to say that the Australian government has been more outspoken than any other Western government in support of an orderly process of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> in East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When that coup took place, the Portuguese set about the problem of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> in Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They seemed to be keen and looking forward to the <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> process which was taking place there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In September Fretilin wanted the Portuguese to return to institute the <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> process which it had started. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During September and November the Fretilin Party waited in vain for the Portuguese to return and continue with their <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack said in his contribution, there then began a process of <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> or decay of an old colonial empire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Sir Magnus Cormack, in relation to South Africa, has failed to understand that the United Nations, by an overwhelming majority and in many cases by votes in excess of ninety with a small number of countries abstaining and with one or two countries in opposition- often countries like Spain- called upon the rest of the United Nations organisation to assist in <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> and in the movement for independence in Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United Nations Committee of TwentyFour, commonly referred to as the <span class="highlight">Decolonisation</span> Committee, sent a mission to Cocos in August 1974 at the invitation of the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, the situation-  above all, the immaturity of Timor’s own aspiring political leaders, who in less than eighteen months have succeeded in wrecking Portugal’s <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> program, sharply polarising political opinions through the territory, and finally plunging the territory into violent civil war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I must say that undoubtedly Australia and particularly the Cocos-Malay community should be indebted to the ‘<span class="highlight">Decolonisation</span>’ Committee of the United Nations- the Committee of TwentyFourwhich went to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in November 1974 at the invitation of the then Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that each June the Australian Government has had to report to the ‘<span class="highlight">Decolonisation</span>’ Committee on the steps that it was taking to achieve political and social reform for these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that Australia and the Cocos Malay community owe a debt of gratitude to the ‘<span class="highlight">Decolonisation</span>’ Committee or the Committee of Twenty-four. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the ‘<span class="highlight">Decolonisation</span>’ Committee of the United Nations had visited the Cocos (Keeling) Islands the Australian representative on the Committee of Twenty-four,  Mr Duncan  Campbell, made a statement to the Committee in November 1 974 setting out the then Government’s policy so far as the Cocos (Keeling) Islands were concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that the Fourth Committee, that is, the <span class="highlight">Decolonisation</span> Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, last considered the Cocos Islands as recently as November and December 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the editorial headed ‘<span class="highlight">Decolonisation</span> fails in Timor’ in the  Courier-Mail  of Monday, 8 December 1 975 we will see that it states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Indonesian invasion is really the culmination of the failure of a <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the unfortunate aspects of the failure of the East Timor <span class="highlight">decolonisation</span> from the Portuguese empire is the lack of neighbourhood initiatives in trying to reach a peaceful solution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
