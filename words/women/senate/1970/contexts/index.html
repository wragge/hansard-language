  <li>
    <p>First of all, I answer the honourable senator by saying that he is charging men and <span class="highlight">women</span> dedicated in the service of this Department who work untiringly to do their best for ex-service people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700407_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate whether his attention has been directed to a statement by  Mrs Gwen  Benzie, Secretary of the Australian <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Basketball Association, in today’s Melbourne ‘Age’ in which she is reported to have said:  lt  was understood but nol specifically mentioned that  no  team  of  coloured players would go  to  South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the many church appeals by all denominations for winter relief for the poor, stressing particularly the needs of deserted wives and children, will the Minister appoint within his Department in each State a representative in the form of an ombudsman with the finance and power to act immediately with church or relief organisations to give assistance to any persons, particularly <span class="highlight">women</span> and children, found to be suffering from hunger, cold or poverty during this coming winter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the situation in which people could go out armed for the purpose of killing for personal gain and there is the situation in which innocent people - children or <span class="highlight">women</span> - could be subjected to harm and death in a way which I feel has to be met with a rather harsh and strong penalty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Too many young men and <span class="highlight">women</span> are dying today as a result of the road toll or in unexpected aeroplane crashes for us to be complacent or undisturbed about these events, lt strikes fear into one to read of the death of these young people, some of whom are of very tender years and others of whom are in their young manhood or womanhood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact the growth in female pemanent staff and the removal of the barrier preventing female officers pursuing their careers after marriage combined with a principle of promotion based on merit have resulted in an increasing number of <span class="highlight">women</span> reaching positions in the service at a higher level than formerly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This question should be directed to the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Council of the Amateur Basketball Union of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 15th January 1973. the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Council of the Amateur Basketball Union of Australia wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs asking for a considered opinion concerning its proceeding with a visit to Taiwan by the Australian <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Basketball team and for advice whether the Government could grant any financial assistance for a visit to China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is hoping for an expansion of Australian-Chinese contacts at all levels and a visit to China by the Australian <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Basketball Team would fit in well with this, but again it was for the Council to decide whether to arrange such a tour or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Additionally, realising that next year is International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year, in conjunction with the Prime Minister’s Department my Department has agreed to convene an international seminar for people engaged in the media, the title of which will be ‘<span class="highlight">Women</span> in the Media’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister consider including single fathers and widowers in a scheme similar to that which now covers <span class="highlight">women</span> who find themselves in similar circumstances, with a view to allowing them to be retrained in an occupation which would allow them to spend more time with their children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result, a survey was undertaken by the officers of my Department among voluntary organisations in the homeless persons field, the men and <span class="highlight">women</span> in their care, and the Advisory Committees on Homeless Persons in each State, on the services and facilities provided to the homeless in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In these 20 years there has been this great change in the pattern of the Australian Labor Party so that instead of being filled with representatives of the people - men and <span class="highlight">women</span> - who were of the people and were part of the people, the men who sit on the Opposition benches in the Parliament are men who belong to a so-called self-elevated elitist group who believe that the mass of the people are bridled and saddled waiting to be ridden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is completely wrong when speaking of the excesses of the past to assert, for instance, that only wealthy squatters were responsible for the degradation and prostitution of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">women</span>, lt is probable that the responsibility lay more with people with whom as a trade unionist I would have had a greater affinity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind the Government that the boys who are being sent to Vietnam are not only sons of members of the Liberal Party or of members of the Country Party or of members of the Democratic Labor Party but also they are sons of members of the Labor movement - sons of men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who are violently opposed to participation in the war in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Massacres such as the one alleged to have occurred at My Lai gave the soldiers momentary illusion that by shooting people equated with the enemy - even babies, <span class="highlight">women</span> and old men - they were finally involved in a genuine military action, he said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now that the position of the Parliamentary Draftsman is to be considerably elevated in status - with the appointment of 2 assistants who will occupy particularised positions - the job could present itself to young men and <span class="highlight">women</span> as a viable administrative Public Service career which has at the end of it a rewarding position not only from the point of view of the financial return but also the status it holds and the work it presents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700423_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the majority of Vietnamese, poor peasants in the defoliated countryside and destitute workers in the city slums, it is what they have been witnessing for a long time: the search and destroy missions; the ‘free zone’ strikes; the BS2 saturation bombings; the Phoenix operation which from December 1967 to December 1968 killed 18,393 civilian Vietcong cadres; the Song My (‘Pinkville’) type of breakfast massacre in which an American infantry unit allegedly shot down some hundreds of men, <span class="highlight">women</span> and children in  a  captured village in the early morning of 16th March 1968; the atrocities regularly described in national United States magazines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In respect of 2 halls of residence - the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Hall of Residence at the University of Tasmania and a hall of residence to be known as Roberts Hall at Monash University - unavoidable delays in planning meant that the amounts of State funds expended on these projects up to 31st December 1969 were insufficient to attract the full Commonwealth grant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the immigration of skilled workers, and with new developments to increase the work force by the greater use of married <span class="highlight">women</span>, the Government is doing its best to cope with a work force situation which is, in the words of the Treasurer  (Mr Bury)  during the course of his Budget Speech becoming ‘very tight’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I shall deal firstly with that part of the question which referred to a purported remark by a judge who was obviously a guest  speaker  at a Liberal Party branch meeting or <span class="highlight">women</span>’s rally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700827_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the Government’s proposals mentioned in the Budget Speech is to train married <span class="highlight">women</span> to re-enter industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The training that the Minister has proposed should be undertaken by industry, but so that industry will not suffer a loss in absorbing a woman in employment the Government has undertaken the burden of training <span class="highlight">women</span> so that they will be efficient when they re-enter industry, the cost of such training to be met by increased indirect taxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Young <span class="highlight">women</span> living in country and smaller urban areas also experience difficulty in obtaining employment because of the narrower range of job opportunities available to them locally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is simply a scheme to train <span class="highlight">women</span> to meet the requirements of industry not, I venture to suggest, so much for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">women</span> who will get a job as for the benefit of industry which will receive yet another subsidy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Subsequently when they find themselves widowed or deserted they take part in this so-called fantastic scheme of the Government because they hope they can qualify or retrain to fulfil a reasonable role in society and obtain something better than the miserly handout that is given to young <span class="highlight">women</span> in these circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So in the main most of these pensioners are men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who have blazed the trail, worked hard for very little and never had an opportunity of accumulating any money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Keeffe  has grievously insulted all those <span class="highlight">women</span> who are in receipt of assistance and aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is one thing to be enthusiastic about the question of pensions and to try to help people to gain more, but it is another thing to suggest that any one of these <span class="highlight">women</span> would lend her body, 1 or 2 nights a week, as he said, to supplement her income from the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To make a statement such as that is most unfair, most unjust and irresponsible, and it is a grave reflection on those <span class="highlight">women</span> throughout Australia who are receiving aid under the social services vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators can take my word for it that hundreds of <span class="highlight">women</span> pensioners club together and put in 20c each to buy food. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a very serious matter and one which naturally reflects very gravely upon the whole body of <span class="highlight">women</span> who are in receipt of that type of pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We realise that repatriation benefits result from promises made by governments of varying types and at various times - when recruiting for a war, while men and <span class="highlight">women</span> are fighting in the war - and from representations that continue after the war when the ravages and results of war become known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Minister and the Department have every right to make their own decisions in this matter and that, if what I propose is legal and considered to be required in Tasmania, ‘ the Commonwealth and the Commonwealthowned repatriation hospital should take advantage of the many benefits which would accrue to the Commonwealth and to ex-servicemen and <span class="highlight">women</span> if the scheme were adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As South Africa will be entering an all white <span class="highlight">women</span>’s team in the Federation Cup tennis series to be held in Perth in December, despite the fact that South Africa has been expelled from the International Lawn Tennis Federation, will the Government take advantage of the occasion to inform the South African Government that in future the refusal of permission to any Australian of non-European origin to enter South Africa would be resented by the people of this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701013_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they had the opportunity of seeing the <span class="highlight">women</span> of this country refusing to use any cosmetics at all or any scents or any of the normal preparations they would probably be reduced to the stage of deciding that they ought to remove sales tax altogether and perhaps pay a bonus for the use of these things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-49-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Government consider that directors whose negligence or downright dereliction of duty is so plainly shown in their failure to detect the shocking position now revealed, or their deliberate acquiescence in a perpetuation of the same, are fit and proper persons to remain in control of such a vast aggregation of the savings of men and <span class="highlight">women</span> with small resources? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710315_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>respect of other inquiries 1 have made, 1 find that the only time when any of these <span class="highlight">women</span> were on the floor is when they were being dragged out or lifted out of the Department of Labour and National Service into the hallway where they could be arrested legally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not like her politics, but I hate to think that we have laws in this country that put 5 <span class="highlight">women</span> into Fairlea prison but allowed a federal member of Parliament to get away with committing the same offence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>AH I am asking is: Why did the Government allow others to get away with breaking the same law that the 5 <span class="highlight">women</span> broke? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the basic philosophy is accepted that a law considered as bad should be broken by the person who holds that view, we have no law; we have no law on public order; no law on property; no law on the rights of man; no law against rape; no law to protect <span class="highlight">women</span> and children and the weak in our community and no law even against murder itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Two misguided brothers who, because they were alleged to be intelligent young men doing university courses, should have known that a visiting dignitary such as a  President  of the United States would be accompanied by armed guards to protect his security in an intensely crowded area, by their actions ran the risk of those guards opening fire on them thus involving <span class="highlight">women</span>, children and babes in arms around them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In determining this level of assistance the Government has taken into account likely increased pressures on technical training facilities arising from demands of such schemes as the retraining  of  married <span class="highlight">women</span>, the retraining of farmers displaced under the rural reconstruction scheme and from the public service and industry for higher technician courses, which would have an effect on the programme  of  the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I pointed out in my speech on the motion for the second reading of the Bill, the law took its course against <span class="highlight">women</span> who were unlawfully in Commonwealth offices - I did not agree with what they were doing - but it did not take its course against others who did the same thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I say that by allowing such an elastic provision to be introduced into the law I think the Government will get itself into the difficulty where it will not be able to prosecute or it is going to have people putting it in a difficult position, such as the 5 <span class="highlight">women</span> who went to Fairlea prison. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr President,  I stand here tonight a senator elected by the people of Western Australia for one express purpose - to convince this Government that it is high time that the death tax laws throughout Australia should be abolished or drastically revised because they are causing hardship, distress and humiliation to thousands of Australians, the majority of whom are <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was a very shrewd and sensible gentleman, because if a man did not have to pay death taxes until his wife died he would not have to pay them at all, as our <span class="highlight">women</span> live longer than we do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it would be agreed that  Sir Arthur  Lee could not be described as a radical, but he has seen fit to refer to the fact that it is in the period of life of this Government, the last 20 years, that there has been an erosion or a devaluation of the pension entitlements of ex-servicemen and <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators and members of the other place are constantly taking up cases on behalf of ex-servicemen and ex-service <span class="highlight">women</span> to whom the Commission has refused repatriation entitlements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A vast improvement is needed in the attitude adopted to applications for repatriation entitlements lodged by the remaining few ex-servicemen and <span class="highlight">women</span> of the Boer War and World War I. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If society is to protect itself as an ordered society, not for cowards but for courageous men, and equally courageous <span class="highlight">women</span> and children, it must protect the man who must go against a criminal gang in the line of law enforcement and could be murdered when carrying out the obligation of the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But America responded and it was because of that response that we continue to enjoy the freedom and liberty which we have and for which so many noble men and <span class="highlight">women</span> made the supreme sacrifice in many theatres of war during World War I and World War II and in Korea and Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point I want to make is this: How can anyone who has a conscientious objection to serving in Vietnam but who will serve in any other theatre of war - he does not agree with what is going on in Vietnam; he does not agree with napalm bombing of children and <span class="highlight">women</span>; he does not agree that it is other than a war of aggression in Vietnam; he does not agree that we should force a system of government on Vietnam - put his name to an alternative type of service which provides that if the Government declares a state of emergency which is approved by Parliament he shall go to Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 think this is a matter in which there should not be any repudiation or delay and in which the Australian Government has a responsibility, as these <span class="highlight">women</span> are wives, of Australian citizens, to see that they receive the same satisfaction as is often received when there is some . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711012_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I say this on behalf of the men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who are on what might be termed working holidays: They do not want to feci that the boom will suddenly be lowered and that they will be told: ‘You have to pack up your bags and go’, lt is all right to talk about idle speculation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711012_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This legislation expresses the Government’s recognition of the rapidly increasing proportion of married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the labour force and of the consequences of this phenomenon for the care of their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since 1961 the proportion of married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the labour force has increased from 17 per cent to over 35 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is evident that, for a wide variety of reasons, an increasing number of married <span class="highlight">women</span> are choosing to remain in or return to paid employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What endeavours, if any, has the PostmasterGeneral made to ensure that <span class="highlight">women</span> are given an equal opportunity to serve in higher levels of the Department and the various bodies within his area of responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of men and <span class="highlight">women</span> holding senior positions is as follows - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Australia, as in other advanced countries overseas, married <span class="highlight">women</span> - including those with children of pre-school age - are entering regular employment in increasing numbers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, in the decade 1960-70 the number of married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force almost doubled - from 9.3 per cent to 18.3 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We wish to ensure that the children of these <span class="highlight">women</span> have every opportunity for the fullest development in both the emotional and physical sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The principal objective of the Commonwealth is set out clearly in a pamphlet entitled ‘<span class="highlight">Women</span> in the Work Force’ which was published by the Department of Labour and National Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, this must be said to represent the Government’s viewpoint -  is interested in the developing role of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force and is concerned with encouraging the best possible use of the talents and abilities of Australian <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true, and I think it can be established across the board, that some <span class="highlight">women</span> find the need to work for their own mental stimulation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we should also consider the granting of a special allowance to mothers of children under 3 years old, as is done now in some of the more advanced countries such as Hungary and Austria, so that the financial pressures which force <span class="highlight">women</span> to work during this period are eased, if not removed altogether. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are just as much concerned with the issue of <span class="highlight">women</span> in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For too long men in legislatures such as this Parliament have been prepared to compel <span class="highlight">women</span> to stay at home and occupy themselves with domestic duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While most <span class="highlight">women</span> who work are forced to do so for purely financial reasons, large numbers of them are seeking employment for other than financial reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Every assistance must be therefore given to <span class="highlight">women</span> wishing to break out of the traditional housewife role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, it is disgraceful that the commencement of any initiative has not occurred until the end of 1972. lt may seem ridiculous to be talking about <span class="highlight">women</span>’s rights in 1972, but it is even more ridiculous that there is a need to do so in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <ul>
      <li>I wish to use the somewhat limited time available at this stage of the session to comment on the Child Care Bill because it concerns an aspect of social matters which has had my close, attention and the close attention of many <span class="highlight">women</span>’s organisations in Australia for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></li>

  <li>
    <p>It should be noted that since 1961 the proportion of married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force has increased from 17 per cent to 35 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has been the increasing social change which has had the attention of the thinking <span class="highlight">women</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the influence of the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s organisations was responsible for the establishment of the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Bureau in the Department of Labour and National Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bureau has also given close attention to many aspects of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s employment and I feel it has been the forerunner to this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is not an inducement by the Government to encourage <span class="highlight">women</span> with preschool age children to enter the work force, but rather I see it as a Government reaction to the social change which has already occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we wish to use the full potential of Australian <span class="highlight">women</span> some of whom are professionally or commercially trained, some of whom wished to be career <span class="highlight">women</span> exclusively and some of whom wish to combine the dual role of homemaker and parent and to be gainfully employed, we would want the oportunity to exist for these <span class="highlight">women</span> to have the right to choose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was interested in the comments about Hungary and the home care allowance which is given to <span class="highlight">women</span> there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My recollection of the statistics in relation to that country, where <span class="highlight">women</span> have been working and perhaps working without choice for a very long time, is that with the introduction of a home care allowance some 75 per cent of the <span class="highlight">women</span>, or an even greater percentage, elected to accept the home care allowance rather than employment outside the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to think that the research which is undertaken will show the attitudes of Australian <span class="highlight">women</span> towards their dual role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We might find an election by many Australian <span class="highlight">women</span> - who work purely for economic reasons - to stay in the home if a home care allowance were provided for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was of great interest to me to have, the opportunity to talk to someone who had been engaged in the supervision of the Government’s child care centres in Finland for some 30 years, I think, and to hear of her experiences and her understanding of this facility which has been provided in that country where the proportion of married <span class="highlight">women</span> who work and have pre-school children is very high indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In one sense perhaps they are part of the social change which <span class="highlight">women</span> have demanded for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think <span class="highlight">women</span> have the right to evaluate the way in which they interpret this social change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we see the role of the mother as being a fundamental ethical and cultural influence and if, at the same, time, we wish to allow <span class="highlight">women</span> to exercise the right of choice which I mentioned, then I believe that a Bill such as the one which the Government is now introducing is necessary for Australia at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 hope that <span class="highlight">women</span> will be protected in their responsibilities and given some choice as to the way in which they see their role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some <span class="highlight">women</span> find a marvellous destiny in dealing with 6 or 7 different personalities in a developing country which requires far greater intelligence than is required for the manufacture of shoes or handbags or for stitching a tag on a shoe or a bit of lace onto a dress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A woman may be stitching lace onto the same type of dress all day; yet people talk of careers for <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today she can work in a factory or a shop or in any of the 99 per cent of vocations which are open to <span class="highlight">women</span>, leaving aside the specialised vocations, such as a fashion career or medicine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the <span class="highlight">women</span> in these specialised vocations do not constitute the great mass of <span class="highlight">women</span> who are working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in actual fact, as we all know, the whole proposition stems from the question of the entry of married <span class="highlight">women</span> into the work force and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is a Government initiative in which we are acting to solve a serious community problem which has evolved as a result of the present community’s activities, and is reflected in the rising proportion of married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the labour force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Most of these <span class="highlight">women</span> have to make arrangements for the care of their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I had previously dealt with the first matter when in response to a question placed on notice on 11th May 1972 by  Senator Mulvihill,  I gave an assurance that Commonwealth Police and Immigration officers had not been used in a sordid battle of call-girl cartels and that the records of the <span class="highlight">women</span> concerned, who were not residents of Australia, made it quite clear that they should not be granted extensions of stay (Hansard, page 137). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is concerned not to encourage, by these measures, more married <span class="highlight">women</span> to go out to work rather than to remain at home but is concerned to provide a remedy to meet a need for an existing situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>100 in Hansard tomorrow they will find that the term ‘remuneration’ which relates to equal remuneration for men and <span class="highlight">women</span> workers for work of equal value includes the ordinary, basic or minimum wage or salary and any additional emoluments whatsoever payable directly or indirectly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact of the matter is that under the guise of claiming that they are helping decent Australian working people - men and <span class="highlight">women</span> - and under the unqualified promises in the policy speech regarding extra leave, equal pay and extra maternity leave, there now emerges the proposition that you must read the policy speech together with the platform; that all these matters are qualified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Government which .cynically exploited the second preference votes of the Australia Party, the Defence of Government Schools party, the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Electoral Lobby and others, will now discard them in case the preferences of those parties should turn against them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have a great respect and regard for the Public Service as such and for the men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who work in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister for the Media yet had an opportunity to read the report on daytime television produced by the Media <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Action Group and the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Electoral Lobby? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have read the report to which the honourable senator refers and 1 have had discussions with two of the <span class="highlight">women</span> who were responsible for the compilation of the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot really ask honourable senators to try to imagine that they are old age pensioners - old <span class="highlight">women</span> and old men living on their own - but if they were, would they not want a doctor to call to see them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The classes of <span class="highlight">women</span> to whom the new benefit will be payable under this Bill are (a) unmarried mothers, including deserted de facto wives and de facto wives of prisoners’, (b) married <span class="highlight">women</span> not living with their husbands (deserting wives) or wives who have been separated for various other reasons, provided that the <span class="highlight">women</span> be living with, and have the custody, care and control of a child or children of whom she is the mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">women</span> are those who are not at present eligible for a widow’s pension under the Social Services Act and who, with their children, have been subject to discrimination in the level of assistance available to them in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As with widows pensions, the supporting mother’s benefit will not be payable if the <span class="highlight">women</span> return to live with their husbands or if they are living with any man on a de facto basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the moment, these <span class="highlight">women</span> will continue to be the responsibility of the States for the first 6 months, and the States will continue to receive assistance from the Commonwealth under the States Grants (Deserted Wives) Act during that period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will, however, be some <span class="highlight">women</span> who will become eligible for the supporting mother’s benefit who have not received State assistance because they would have been excluded by the State means tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am hopeful that when these talks are finalised benefits payable to <span class="highlight">women</span> through these proposed amendments will be paid immediately instead of requiring a 6 months lapse as is necessary now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that we aim to end these anomalies but the important thing about this Bill is that it is a clear demonstration of this Government’s determination to bring an end as quickly as it can to the discrimination that existed against <span class="highlight">women</span>, and in this case certain classes of <span class="highlight">women</span> such as unmarried mothers, deserted wives or wives who have been separated for other reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Its effect will perhaps be felt mainly by the children of the <span class="highlight">women</span> concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not possible to estimate the exact number of <span class="highlight">women</span> who will benefit from the proposed legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is expected that around 3,200 <span class="highlight">women</span> will be affected each year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It takes account of representations on the matter put forward by the Council of Commonwealth Public Service Organisations, and will be applauded by those <span class="highlight">women</span> in Government employment wishing to reconcile domestic responsibilities with a career in the Commonwealth Service or other Government instrumentalities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The ILO Convention is concerned that the existence of maternity benefits should not result in discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span> in employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It therefore provides that the individual employer shall not bc individually liable for the cost of such benefits due to <span class="highlight">women</span> employed by him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government recognises that it has a role and responsibility, as Australia’s largest employer, in promoting the status of <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill will also help <span class="highlight">women</span> endeavouring to pursue their careers on the same terms as men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by reminding the Senate that this Bill not only provides improved conditions of employment for Australian Government employees but also facilitates the retention of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of these <span class="highlight">women</span> are experienced and expensively trained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When it comes to our overseas image, our sportsmen and <span class="highlight">women</span> are probably our best advertisement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the advertisement was in the singular, BHP had 12 vacancies as tally clerks which were open to <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also considered that the offers of reimbursing travel and removal costs from interstate sources and the availability of housing fall well short of what could be considered an added inducement to undertake arduous work in hot and dusty conditions in a remote location with little in the way of employment for <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government received representations that an exception from the 10 year rule should also be made for short term endowment policies that are taken out independently of superannuation funds by people who are within 10 years of the common retiring ages of 65 years for men and 60 years for <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister whether any action has been taken regarding the fixation of this set of salaries because I think - I am not quite sure of this, I am speaking from memory - that the salaries of these men and <span class="highlight">women</span> were before the Senate last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to refer to the attitude of the Government in this matter because it does give the impression that the granting of these maternity leave provisions has fulfilled somehow the promise to the <span class="highlight">women</span> of Australia that this Government understands the situation in which <span class="highlight">women</span> see themselves in this time of social change while it seeks to give a discriminatory benefit to only those <span class="highlight">women</span> who are employees within the Commonwealth Government instrumentalities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cash and medical benefits shall be provided either by means of compulsory social insurance or by means of public funds; in either case they, shall be provided as  a  matter of right to all <span class="highlight">women</span> who comply with the prescribed conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any contribution due under a compulsory social insurance scheme providing maternity benefits and tax based upon payrolls which is raised for the purpose of providing such benefits shall, whether paid both by the employer and the employees or by the employer, be paid in respect of the total number of men and <span class="highlight">women</span> employed by the undertakings concerned, without distinction of sex. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In no case shall the employer be individually liable for the cost of such benefits due to <span class="highlight">women</span> employed by him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pose the question: How does the Government see itself to be implementing something which is to be an elimination of discrimination when under this particular Bill it gives a higher benefit to <span class="highlight">women</span> who receive a high salary and a lower benefit to <span class="highlight">women</span> who receive a low salary and no benefit at all to those <span class="highlight">women</span> who are not employed by the Commonwealth Public Service? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should it be society as a whole or should it be the industry where the <span class="highlight">women</span> are employed or should it be part of the whole social service pattern so that some maternity benefit is paid to all <span class="highlight">women</span> who have a maternity condition and who have the responsibility of the expenses of confinement and other matters related to the birth of the child? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is not this part of the convention which we would want to adopt dealing with discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that so many more Australian <span class="highlight">women</span> are now seeking to combine employment with their role of motherhood and home maker has brought us to the need for revision of many of our attitudes and to the stage where there will need to be  a  revision of many of what have been our conventions in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are talking about the way in which a woman should have the freedom of choice to exercise whether she wishes to be wholly engaged as a home maker or to combine this with some career for her own fulfilment and for a national contribution to our economy, we need to consider that perhaps Government assistance will be required in the form of incentives to employers to provide more flexibility in hours and types of services in which <span class="highlight">women</span> may work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We repeatedly hear about the higher percentages of <span class="highlight">women</span> who are engaged m the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have all sorts of statistics to show us how many more of these <span class="highlight">women</span> are married and who have children of pre-school age, yet it has been some years since the first Gorton proposal, that the Government would create child care facilities for the children of working mothers was announced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we hear all of these statistics about <span class="highlight">women</span> who are in the work force in Australia, we really do have to ask: Where are they at the top level in our professions and in our commercial activity? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been lack of opportunity for <span class="highlight">women</span> to find the range of occupation which their capacity would have allowed them to reach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they are not yet at the top level in their chosen professions, whatever employment they have sought, we must then take up the point that was made at the end of the Minister’s speech when introducing the Bill, when he said that these <span class="highlight">women</span> would be making a contribution because they had had the facilities of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we regard education and training as a national investment, surely we should allow the aspirations which will flow from that to reach the top level in all of the chosen professions of the <span class="highlight">women</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There undoubtedly has existed in the past a social, sexual, psychological and political discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the activist <span class="highlight">women</span>’s organisations of Australia are pointing somewhat militantly at present to this discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been gaps in opportunity for <span class="highlight">women</span> and the fulfilment of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s aspirations has not yet been reached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to think that this Government or any government in Australia would see the whole question of <span class="highlight">women</span>, their opportunities, the facilities for them to fulfil their professional careers and the ideal way in which the family structure should be protected, as part of a whole national institution and not one in which a single Bill is sought to give a discriminatory benefit only to those <span class="highlight">women</span> who are Commonwealth Government employees and then to have, as a rider to that, the fact that the Government would intervene if this principle were to be introduced in the ordinary, commercial sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have to support a Bill that gave any benefits to <span class="highlight">women</span> in their employment situation, but I question the way in which this Bill gives a handout only to the <span class="highlight">women</span> of Australia who are in the Commonwealth Public Service and discriminates against those who are in other commercial employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should we really not be asking who should bear the cost of what should be a national policy in order to allow <span class="highlight">women</span> to have their right of choice in the future, namely, whether they combine their role of motherhood with a career which they may wish to pursue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It amounts to a special privilege for <span class="highlight">women</span> in the Commonwealth Public Service solely because the Government has a focus as narrow as its own <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate it for recognising its capacity to deliver to the <span class="highlight">women</span> in the Commonwealth service the benefit of 3 months’ leave as for their maternity requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For our own employees we will apply the International Labour Organisation Protection Conventions going back to 1919 which guarantee <span class="highlight">women</span> leave with full pay and benefits for 6 weeks before and 6 weeks after confinement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Webster  raised what is obviously a very pertinent question as to whether the Government ought not to consider the question of providing this social service benefit to all <span class="highlight">women</span> in this situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to the present proposal the Government has a liability as a Commonwealth Government to provide funds for those <span class="highlight">women</span> who would be employees of the Commonwealth Government and who would be entitled to the benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I particularly put up a plea for <span class="highlight">women</span> in the armed Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I deal with the position of unmarried <span class="highlight">women</span> who are in the defence forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I am unable to see why the position of single men or single <span class="highlight">women</span> in the Parliament should be denied acceptance and acknowledgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It amazes me that over the years so little consideration has been given to the single men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who serve in the Parliament and who contribute to this scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The married members of Parliament - both men and <span class="highlight">women</span> - now have been very well catered for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The married <span class="highlight">women</span> had to fight for some time to obtain these benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The husbands of the married <span class="highlight">women</span> who have been in this Parliament may have been in quite good positions but the trustees sponsoring the fund eventually recognised that they had rights because of the contributions made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the only area that is now neglected is that of the single men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who serve in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Men, <span class="highlight">women</span> and children are now able to go about their lawful avocations only because of the efficacy of our prisons and the efficiency of our police force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Custom, tradition, the thoughts of men and <span class="highlight">women</span> are such that a Bill is introduced, the Minister makes a second reading speech and when thi debate is resumed the Opposition, the Country Party, the Democratic Labor Party and the independent group each have the right to have at least one of their senators speak. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Calley, a mass murderer who has destroyed <span class="highlight">women</span>, children and babies is still living in comfort in the United States and being treated as a hero, I suppose, makes a mockery of all the pretentions of the rest of the world to introduce humanity into war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Considering the fact that after a thorough investigation by the United Nations the Associated Country <span class="highlight">Women</span> of the World still retains its status with that organisation and works in close harmony with its specialised agencies, does the Government’s refusal to allow the mixed racial Rhodesian delegates to the conference to enter Australia contravene the United Nations General Assembly’s resolution of approval? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then some idea crept into the oddity of mind that conceived this scheme to say that if a partnership were composed of a husband and wife, it would get only one payment of $1,500; and that single <span class="highlight">women</span> sharing in a partnership or a company were to qualify for assistance only if actively participating in orchard activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister indicated that the Government had agreed to repeal these provisions in the Public Service Act which could be said to discriminate against <span class="highlight">women</span> but which had become redundant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I said then that there must be no doubt that this Government is determined to improve the CMF, that it will give this country an Army Reserve which is attractive to the young men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who wish to serve in it, and which, with the Regular Army, will also provide a viable base for expansion should this be necessary in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I am submitting to this House, therefore, is a record of achievement in regard to the nation’s defence capability; major improvements in conditions of service of our servicemen and <span class="highlight">women</span>; greater efficiency and economy in defence organisation and spending; and a prudent and responsible defence posture for present circumstances and the future strategic prospect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The thing that impresses me about <span class="highlight">women</span> at the moment is that one-third or more of our work force is made up of <span class="highlight">women</span> and that the commercial world, it is obvious, could not get on without them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So, the Government brought into effect maternity leave so that <span class="highlight">women</span> could take time off work before and after the birth of their babies if they wanted to continue working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So often these days with so much glib talk about <span class="highlight">women</span>’s lib <span class="highlight">women</span> feel that they have not contributed anything and that they are in some ways useless because they have stayed at home, had babies, looked after them and did not go out and build bridges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If mothers are to go out to work-it is obvious that they are going to go and nothing is going to stop them, be that right or wrong-we, as people who have some conscience and some role to play must make sure that the children who are born of these <span class="highlight">women</span> learn things that they would have learned from their mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are <span class="highlight">women</span> and children in Melbourne who, if they wake up in the night, have no recourse to the services of a doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is no wonder that in some areas of Australia <span class="highlight">women</span> have been forced to set up their own health centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe in <span class="highlight">women</span>’s lib so we will tax the one million working wives in this country as well’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is being done by these people who talk about looking after the <span class="highlight">women</span> of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So here we have a scheme which will cost more, which will penalise all working <span class="highlight">women</span> and young single people, which will provide for only standard ward accommodation and which will shrink the number of private hospitals - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that same year the Income Tax Assessment Act was amended to make pensions and similar benefits payable to people of pensionable age (65 years for men and 60 for <span class="highlight">women</span>) taxable as from 1 July 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that I speak not only on behalf of the <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australia who seek to have a greater participation in our economic activity but also on behalf of those <span class="highlight">women</span> who need the child care facilities to enable them to give members of thenfamily what has been established now as the average standard in education and opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps we can talk at some later stage and at greater length of child care programs and of those initiatives which the <span class="highlight">women</span> of Australia hope to see. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why has the Minister not discussed the matter with the men and <span class="highlight">women</span> of the Territory who know? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My Party is made up of a great number of men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who have been involved in social welfare programs, in local government and with many other planning problems associated with the great developments of our cities in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There can be no doubt that since coming to office this Government has sought consistently to remove all forms of discrimination from our laws, whether it be discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span>, Aborigines, migrants or in the various other forms that it appears in our statutes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is the attitude and conviction of men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who look upon the Senate as a chamber of frustration and who misunderstand its historic role and its purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He reminded me of all the campaigns in history and of all the occasions on which people have opposed every attempt to change any social situation- from putting the Plimsoll line on ships to the 40-hour week, to giving people the vote at 21, to giving <span class="highlight">women</span> the vote at all and to the roads of ruin of which politics are always so full. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that the students had legitimate grievances and these included greater student participation in course design, freedom of choice of the means of assessment, reduced class sizes and the introduction of a <span class="highlight">women</span>’s study course? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are conscious of the fact that the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  found it necessary to contact many organisations in the Australian community, in particular <span class="highlight">women</span>’s organisations, to seek their support for the consumer protection part of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The consensus of the working men and <span class="highlight">women</span> with respect to the fundamental institutions of a free economy will be secured, for strong and vigorous unions will continue to exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The undersigned men and <span class="highlight">women</span> of Australia vigorously protest against your Government’s reported provision of Government funds amounting to $150,000 to African Liberation Movements this year, which amounts to contravention of United Nations Charter and is direct interference in internal affairs of African countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That whereas our constitutional parliamentary democracy was clearly developed as a Federation to preserve for all time to the Australian people their cherished right to live as free men and <span class="highlight">women</span>, enjoying complete liberty of worship, assembly, speech, movement and the communication of knowledge and information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-6">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that within our traditional male chauvinist society it did cause a little confusion that the Government was at least recognising the fact that there were men who were placed in the position, which has traditionally been ascribed to <span class="highlight">women</span>, of having the responsibility of looking after children without the assistance of the mother of the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the war years, she worked with the Family Welfare Branch and the AIF <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs aware that finance has been requested by the National Council of Aboriginal and Island <span class="highlight">Women</span> for the payment of rental for the headquarters of the Council which is presently at 99 <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In my position as Minister I receive many applications from the National Council of Aboriginal and Island <span class="highlight">Women</span> for financial assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the honourable senator will find that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Council of <span class="highlight">Women</span>, through its Secretary,  Mr Briggs,  is especially thankful for the Australian Government’s contributions to the organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, concerns International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is the international seminar which the Minister for the Media announced a short time ago would be arranged as part of International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year a charge against the grant? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this seminar to be arranged by the Status of <span class="highlight">Women</span> Commission of the United Nations or by the National Advisory Committee or by the Department of the Media? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As at least 2 members of the National Advisory Committee have stated that crisis referral and counselling centres for <span class="highlight">women</span> are typical of urgent community needs, is it envisaged that the $2m will be spent in the establishment of these services? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If recognition is given to this urgent need and if the initial grant is rapidly absorbed in the establishment of such centres, will the Government assist with further funds to enable the diversity of voluntary organisations to express their priorities to accent the needs and achievements of the <span class="highlight">women</span> of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this the way the Government looks after <span class="highlight">women</span>’s interests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is not to sanction this sort of action that this Government has appointed a special adviser on <span class="highlight">women</span>’s affairs, or does this Government believe that by donating $2m to International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year it will silence vocal <span class="highlight">women</span>’s organisations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet for the sake of paltry short-term savings, as the price of losing the time and talent of men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who have agreed to serve their country, judges, academics, State public servants and businessmen our opponents propose to throttle these new activities; they intend to cut off the source of expert and public advice so essential to any planning for the effective, efficient, most humane and least expensive ways of dealing with Australia’s accumulated social and economic problems for the rest of this century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of child endowment payments it was alleged that this would bring about all sorts of promiscuity and <span class="highlight">women</span> would have babies just for the sake of being paid this benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It needed more bodies than the baby stakes were providing and therefore management started to tempt <span class="highlight">women</span> back into the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the morals appropriate to that action, industry wooed the <span class="highlight">women</span> back to the work force without a care or thought for the fate of the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For many <span class="highlight">women</span> in that area the rent is not paid and the furniture is not paid for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such <span class="highlight">women</span> find that all sorts of debts have accumulated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As honourable senators are aware, men receive the age pension at 65 and <span class="highlight">women</span> receive it at 60 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As <span class="highlight">women</span> become eligible for the age pension 5 years earlier than men, why could not the Government abolish the means test for <span class="highlight">women</span> over 70 years of age? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told in the Budget Speech that next April the Government will abolish the means test for men and <span class="highlight">women</span> over 70 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why could the Government not abolish it for <span class="highlight">women</span> over 65 years of age? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should there be this difference when <span class="highlight">women</span> are paid the pension 5 years earlier than men? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer announced in the Budget Speech that eligibility for service pensions would be extended to ex-service men and <span class="highlight">women</span> of Commonwealth countries who had theatre of war service in wars or warlike situations in which Australian forces were involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed legislation will apply not only to British exservice men and <span class="highlight">women</span> but also to ex-service men and <span class="highlight">women</span> from other Commonwealth countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, Indian ex-service men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who now reside in Australia also will be eligible for those benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal is that Commonwealth ex-service men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who had theatre of war service in these conflicts will be eligible for the same service pension entitlements as Australian ex-service men and <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I may add something to this, I am at the present time having inquiries made to see how it will be possible for us to extend these benefits not only to Commonwealth ex-service men and <span class="highlight">women</span> but also to ex-service men and <span class="highlight">women</span> of other allied countries who were engaged in wars or warlike conflicts alongside the Australian forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to Commonwealth ex-service men and <span class="highlight">women</span>, they will become eligible for the benefits as soon as the appropriate legislation has been passed through the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the Bill does become law, Commonwealth ex-service men and <span class="highlight">women</span> will be eligible for the benefits and they will be able to obtain them by applying to the officers of the Department of Repatriation and Compensation in their respective States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The eligibility of Commonwealth ex-service men and <span class="highlight">women</span> will be widely advertised throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been reference to <span class="highlight">women</span>’s rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably it will be money well spent because the products of the labours of these <span class="highlight">women</span> will be future taxpayers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say unquestionably that under this concept of the new family life where for various reasons <span class="highlight">women</span> return to work after a period of years, the provision of pre-school child minding facilties is a must. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These days it is most essential to bring <span class="highlight">women</span> into the calculation because a very big percentage of the work force is <span class="highlight">women</span>, and they will be hit- stunned would be a better word- by this tax on unearned income if Caucus permits it to be brought into legislative form in the next few weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the same year the Income Tax Assessment Act was amended to make pensions and similar benefits payable to people of pensionable age, that is, 65 years for men and 60 for <span class="highlight">women</span>, taxable, as from 1 July 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who offend against the laws of society, as we accept them, must pay for their social sins but we have no right in a so-called civilised society to treat those who have been deprived of their liberty and personal freedom with physical punishment and undignified procedures that label them as less than animals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, cases have arisen where Australian <span class="highlight">women</span> have been widowed on account of desertion or divorce while residing overseas and, upon their return to Australia, have had to wait a period of 5 years before becoming eligible for widow’s pension, notwithstanding that they may have lived in Australia for most of their lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During this speech I shall be using the term veterans to describe those exservicemen and <span class="highlight">women</span> who are covered by repatriation legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1960- the latest figures I have- 6 per cent of <span class="highlight">women</span> and 7 per cent of men only were unmarried in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remarriage rates in the U.S. and U.K. are high (local figures are not available), with around 75 per cent of U.S. divorcees being remarried within five years of divorce, and the divorced-not-remarried group representing at any one time around 2 per cent of the population for men and around 3 per cent for <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In an era when <span class="highlight">women</span> are asserting more and more successfully and more justifiably their equality before the law and in all respects with men, I suggest it is not appropriate that marriage should be regarded as constituting a right to permanent support no matter what the circumstances and no matter whether or not a woman is capable of taking her place in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this question which is embedded in the modern debate on the relationships between men and <span class="highlight">women</span>, on authority- Professor L. Neville Brown- had this to say on the general philosophical question of maintenance:   . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In certain parts of the country opportunities for work are too few and industry too one-sided to enable employment to be provided for all the <span class="highlight">women</span> who want to undertake gainful employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, whilst I think we can look forward to a social consciousness developing which will eliminate the notion of maintenance altogether, at the present stage of the development of our institutions, having regard to the fact that there is still a large generation of <span class="highlight">women</span> who have undertaken as their sole life work the upkeep of a home and the nurture of their children, account has to be taken of these people with these attitudes and in this situation in life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our Committee was very conscious of the situation of such <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real causes of the disintegration of marriage, I suggest, are to be found in such things as increasing urbanisation, increasing industrialisation, greater social mobility, the emancipation of <span class="highlight">women</span>, the weakening of religious sanctions and, I suppose we could say, the increased all-round prosperity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That law is peculiar to this country, but the relationships between men and <span class="highlight">women</span> tend to be more universal and more important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the patients to whom I have spoken in the last few years- young men and womenhave impressed me with the morality of their relationships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, each of us understands, whether we are men or <span class="highlight">women</span> in terms of our genetic make-up, that we are caught in a situation in which we see our functioning in terms of our being male or female. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">women</span> become better educated and liberated they may wish to return to the work force, and the men in society may have to take over more of the role of home making and child rearing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to protect the institution of marriage, if we are to stop <span class="highlight">women</span> being slaves, caught in the home, and men being free and able to work, we may need to look at this social aspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> have been liberated and have different expectations, not only because their attitudes are different but also because their education is better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Modern contraceptive practice has enabled <span class="highlight">women</span> to control child bearing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there are smaller families rather than larger families, and <span class="highlight">women</span> are tending to return to the work force in their mid-thirties whereas previously they worked in that brief period between school and marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one examines the death rates, sickness rates and psychiatric illness rates of married men and single men and married <span class="highlight">women</span> and single <span class="highlight">women</span> one will find that married men are healthier than single men and have lower mortality rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One will find also that married <span class="highlight">women</span> are worse off than single <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Marriage, as it exists at present in Australia, has a very marked medical disadvantage for <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a lot of concern in society that many <span class="highlight">women</span> would be disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is fair to say that <span class="highlight">women</span> will be potentially disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am anxious that we should get justice for the <span class="highlight">women</span> who have been a disadvantaged group in our society up to now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that this tells me is that there is an area of potential hardship for some <span class="highlight">women</span>, especially ibr the mature woman to whom  Senator James  McClelland referred who may have had only a brief period in the workforce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very keen to ensure that under this Bill we do not create the situation where a whole generation of <span class="highlight">women</span> who have contributed to family life and to the bringing up of children are now left with nothing but the chance to go back and work for subsistence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the kind of factors taken into consideration will enable these <span class="highlight">women</span> to get adequate protection for maintenance, because I again draw your attention to the comments on the British divorce Bill and to the actions which followed it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see them operating to offer therapy to people at a time of crisis, to help children through a period when they are likely to get very disturbed, and to help men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who have to make decisions about their own worth and future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point that I want to emphasise early in this speech is that the Minister and, I presume, the Government have initiated and put into the record the term ‘veterans’ which the Minister defines as those ex-servicemen and <span class="highlight">women</span> covered by repatriation legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the conflict of interest of <span class="highlight">women</span> who assert that there is economic value in the work that they do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This must raise the question: Does the Minister have some intention or do his advisers have some intention of instituting some sort of assistance on a basis different from the assistance given to <span class="highlight">women</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have talked much in public and in the Senate today about equal treatment for men and <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am in fact sorry, in a way, that there has been specially privileged treatment given to <span class="highlight">women</span> in this area in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think it has done the <span class="highlight">women</span> of Australia any good to have this special privilege in the area of widows pensions because it makes it look as though it is a problem germane only to <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australia instead of what it truly is, namely a family problem in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may be special mitigating circumstances in the case of <span class="highlight">women</span> in terms of their earning capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think in the case of a man who wishes to stay at home to care for his children full time or who wishes to take a part-time job and receive a part-time pension, there should be no difference made between him, in that reduced earning capacity, and <span class="highlight">women</span> who have been in that capacity traditionally for a long time in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While I am waving the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s lib banner, let me point out that even some of the younger wives are not trained to earn their living and do not expect to go out into the work force, and it is hardly fair of us to force them out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those who do work generally work in the lower paid jobs at the moment, and many <span class="highlight">women</span> in professions are more lowly paid than the men in those professions are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I feel that society is placing more and more pressure on people at the moment, and it is certainly placing more pressure on <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Senate to acknowledge that, although our society is changing, the cry of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s lib is not an excuse for bypassing social and economic justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government sees this measure as being of such importance to the Australian community that we have welcomed any views which any person or organisation, including representatives of the insurance industry, <span class="highlight">women</span>’s organisations, trade unions, and of course the Opposition parties in this Parliament, wish to place before us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think <span class="highlight">women</span> in that position must be very much more adequately protected than this Bill would provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One would assume from the argument of those people that the Victorian era with its low divorce rate was a period of unparalleled marital bliss, but today few men and <span class="highlight">women</span> would wish to return to those days when a wife was frequently just one of her husband’s chattels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The change from the extended biological family we had in the past to the more fragile nuclear family, the increase in the breadth of education for <span class="highlight">women</span> in our society and the changing role of opportunities for <span class="highlight">women</span> have all made marriage a more stressful situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that honourable senators have to take account of the fact that provided reasonable protection is given to any party to a marriage which has broken down, we have to acknowledge the fact that social mores are changing and that more and more <span class="highlight">women</span> in fact are undertaking lives which are independent of the home, of their family and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Much debate is yet to take place at the Committee stage but there are a number of points that I would like to make generally as to how this Bill affects or will affect the <span class="highlight">women</span> of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am a little concerned at some of the pressure that has been put on the <span class="highlight">women</span> of the community in relation to this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had many approaches from <span class="highlight">women</span> who have expressed their concern, not necessarily for their own cases, but for what they believe to be the potential of this Bill and its possible effect on <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many personal contracts are undertaken between individuals in our society and between men and <span class="highlight">women</span> which are voluntarily broken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President,  I wish to speak at quite some further length on the effects of this aspect on children and on the potential effects of this Bill on the status of <span class="highlight">women</span> in our society, as a reflection of their status and on just how we can hope through a Bill which deals with personal relationships to come to a fair law which will enable reality to be reflected and will enable people to live believing that they have been justly treated, knowing that they have behind them what is regarded as a social failure but also knowing that they at least have an equal chance of living a decent life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the Family Law Bill takes into account the changing roles of <span class="highlight">women</span> in modern society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-0-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>First, I draw attention to the fact that in October 1974 the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee circularised all doctors in Australia, drawing attention to a possible association between the use of a drug and the development of cancer of the breast in <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the cause of much distress and considerable mortality among Australian <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I would wonder why if we have a situation in which there is even a hint that a drug used for the treatment of a common condition and a drug not unique in its properties might be causing cancer or might be contributing to cancer in Australian <span class="highlight">women</span> we do not seek the voluntary withdrawal of the drug by the appropriate drug company until the facts are known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is even a suggestion from those studies that there is a possible association between a common cancer in <span class="highlight">women</span> and a drug used for a condition for which other treatment could be effective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the virtue in protecting the <span class="highlight">women</span> of the United States of America and not offering the same protection to the <span class="highlight">women</span> of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But here we have a situation where we are being warned by the Drug Evaluation Committee of a complication which could mean the death of <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is the kind of contraceptive arrangement which is often used for <span class="highlight">women</span> who cannot afford to use the oral contraceptive pill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the kind of complication which, if neglected, could lead to the death of these <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should let <span class="highlight">women</span> have part of the say when they attend a doctor and when a choice is made of a proper contraceptive device for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly there will be problems, teething troubles, at the start, but I am sure that, with co-operation between the regions and the various charitable and voluntary organisations that work in every State, it will be in the best interests of those people in the community who are less fortunate than others in difficult times, particularly <span class="highlight">women</span> and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Experience has shown that the definition of aged person in the principal Act- namely men aged 65 and over and <span class="highlight">women</span> aged 60 and over- is somewhat arbitrary and that people in younger aged groups often suffer from handicaps or disabilities which result in them also needing accommodation of the type provided under the Aged Persons Homes Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 30 October  Senator Melzer  referred to the situation of <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She referred to whether this BUI reflected or in fact determined the status of <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the Senate that for all that many honourable senators have said, <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australia today are not equal and it is not the province of the Family Law Bill, this Bill being basically a divorce BUI, to determine the status of <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This sort of BUI can only reflect the status of <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australia today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian <span class="highlight">women</span> are not equal in the sense that many honourable senators argued when they rose to speak to this BUI. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said a minute ago that in fact the Family Law BUI can only reflect the situation of <span class="highlight">women</span> and children in society today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I suggest to the Senate that Australian society, having been what it is for so long and only so recently undergoing change, does not put Australian <span class="highlight">women</span> generally in the same economic situation as men are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be nice if the theory could be carried out that <span class="highlight">women</span> did not need maintenance and that child maintenance were the only sort of maintenance we needed to consider. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to recognise that in Australia in 1974 when we talk about <span class="highlight">women</span>’s economic and social status we are dealing with conditions which were set 20, 30 or 40 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not dealing with conditions which are currently being set for the advancement of <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australian society nor with conditions as recent as 5 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australian society today who are in a particular social and economic position as a result of very different attitudes which overwhelmingly obtained for a long period of time and indeed until just very recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The dependent members of our society who have been put in the position of being dependent because of those attitudes- basically the <span class="highlight">women</span> and children of our society- must be guarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government- this Government or any future government- brings forward legislation which will genuinely enable <span class="highlight">women</span> to be more independent, particularly economically, then I shall welcome it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there has been very little recognition given to the fact that the overwhelming majority of <span class="highlight">women</span> who have undertaken what we call home duties, who have occupied the traditional social role of wife, housewife and mother, have had a very large bearing in many cases on their husband’s earning capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many examples of cases such as this where, through their supportive dependent role, <span class="highlight">women</span> in our society have enabled the men to reach a higher degree of proficiency and a higher earning capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our laws have treated <span class="highlight">women</span> very badly in this respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the Senate that there will be no real equality for <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australia until there is some coming to grips with the economic status of this type of woman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we must recognise- as against groups such as the Divorce Law Reform Association which want to see the pure theory followed without looking at these sorts of mitigating facts- that until other laws which actually determine the economic and social role of <span class="highlight">women</span> are changed, this Bill if and when it is passed must reflect those other facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general statement can fairly be made that most <span class="highlight">women</span> between the ages of 25 and 40 withdraw from the work force because they become mothers and they have to care for their children to the stage when they feel the children are old enough or independent enough to look after themselves and where harm will not be done to the families if the <span class="highlight">women</span> do go out to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is important that the Senate recognises and that Australian society recognise the very simple fact which is known to anybody who has pursued a career, either man or <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">women</span> or the individuals who withdraw from the work force at age approximately 25 years and attempt to re-enter at 40 can make some progress in their professions but they can never make the sort of progress which compensates for losing those crucial years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned before that there has been a conditioning of <span class="highlight">women</span> in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation has changed rapidly, but the fact is that very many young <span class="highlight">women</span> in their late twenties and early thirties are now in the position that they left school at the age of 1 3 or 14 years, possibly did a 6 months’ training course in business studies to teach them shorthand and typing, if they were lucky. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">women</span> are not now fit to go out into the work force and earn anything like a reasonable income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have encountered many <span class="highlight">women</span>, just a little older, who never went to work at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would apply to many <span class="highlight">women</span> now at about the age of 40 years who, when they finished their primary school, did not go to work at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have very many <span class="highlight">women</span>, and not necessarily even middle aged <span class="highlight">women</span>, who are in no situation at the moment to go out and start earning anything like a reasonable living income in today’s society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision that there be some special maintenance to enable <span class="highlight">women</span> in that situation to achieve a reasonable degree of job skill which would enable them to live decentlynot just to survive- is a very important one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have always known that there were battered wives and battered children in Australia, but only recently have enough of these <span class="highlight">women</span> come forward, had access to groups like <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Electoral Lobby and others which have made their mark in this area, for us to start to count just how big a problem this is in Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Previously these <span class="highlight">women</span> were too ashamed to admit that this was their way of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is appropriate that there be some sort of safeguard in this Bill for <span class="highlight">women</span> and children in that situation whereby they can be protected promptly through a court injunction so that they may be given some hope of getting out of this absolutely appalling situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there dignity in clause 5 1 which seeks, at a time when <span class="highlight">women</span> are being moved more and more to full equality within the law and within society, to set back <span class="highlight">women</span>’s rights in this community by centuries? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If clause 51 were passed I would advise all young <span class="highlight">women</span> approaching marriage to so equip themselves professionally before entering marriage and to so keep up by refresher course their professions that they can waterproof themselves against dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What an extraordinary situation in a government which professes to believe in equality for <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fundamentally, it is a Bill which discriminates wickedly against <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must surely ask ourselves what this legislation contributes to the betterment of the relationships between men and <span class="highlight">women</span> in the total Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Further,  Mrs Whitlam  said, with regard to marriage, that she thought that within a period of about a quarter of a century there would be fewer marriages, that marriage would be less common but would be more secure, and that marriage would be confined more to <span class="highlight">women</span> who were in their thirties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In recent times, along with many other members of this Parliament, I have had an opportunity to meet and to mix with a large number of people, men and <span class="highlight">women</span> of varying religious and political attitudes, and it has become more and more evident to me that in reference to this piece of legislation there is in their minds a determination that they need a full measure of time to examine something which is basic to them, something which must come with a measure of change but something which they are not prepared to admit in its present immense and virtually unresearched form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Family law, as I understand it, is the law which governs the relationships between men and <span class="highlight">women</span> and parents and children and particularly when that relationship is governed by the institution of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Men and <span class="highlight">women</span> may marry when and whom they will, provided that they are sufficiently mature to undertake the commitment … <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that in our community are some older <span class="highlight">women</span> who never expected to enter the work force or who have never been trained to enter the work force and who may not reasonably be expected to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was disquieting to hear earlier in the debate that in the marriage situation men are bad for <span class="highlight">women</span> but <span class="highlight">women</span> are good for men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I point out to the Senate that most of the major wars in history have been fought over love between men and <span class="highlight">women</span> or the want of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In emancipating <span class="highlight">women</span> it has brought them to a position where they are able to philander in much the same way as men have been able to do always. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a single justification were needed for the level of expenditure we propose, it is given by the fact that the 1971 census recorded that some 67 per cent of men and some 80 per cent of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the workforce claimed no formally recognized post-school qualification of any kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, on 26 February 1973, the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  established a working party to examine and report on the problems of homeless men and <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the occasion he said that the Government had decided to introduce a program to help meet the material needs and raise the dignity of homeless men and <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The homeless men and <span class="highlight">women</span> to be assisted are in poverty in the sense that they have few independent resources and lack a conventional home with most of the social or economic supports a home normally provides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to assist eligible organisations engaged in providing temporary accommodation and personal services for homeless men and <span class="highlight">women</span> and, in one-parent family situations, their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who will benefit from the improved services for the homeless are now receiving income security benefits at rates and under conditions which, in accordance with the Government’s enlightened and progressive policy, have been liberalised dramatically since the end of 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The measures proposed within the Bill are based on a compassionate understanding of the needs and very real problems and homeless men and <span class="highlight">women</span> and of their alienation, their loneliness and their despair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know of girls and <span class="highlight">women</span> working in offices who are renting flats and homes and the increases have already been passed on to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people whom I know of who are paying these increased rents are girls and <span class="highlight">women</span> who are not receiving the minimum that is allowed in this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I deplore this type of legislation which imposes upon thrifty people additional taxation which, as  Senator Greenwood  has pointed out, can be passed on to girls, <span class="highlight">women</span> and young men who are renting flats from people who will have to pay this additional tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 21 November (Hansard, page 2630)  Senator Scott  asked me, as Minister representing the Prime Minister, a question without notice concerning International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am informed that the submission by the Co-ordinating <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Group requires elaboration before an assessment can be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian National Advisory Committee on International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year has consequently requested more details from the  Chairman  of the Group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-6">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I invite all members of the Senate, men and <span class="highlight">women</span>, to join us at a small function this evening without any great prolongation of this adjournment debate if the Leader of the Opposition, as I am sure he will, and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition will permit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-100-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate compliments the Government on recognising 1975 as International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year, and asks the Government to take urgent and immediate steps to eliminate all forms of discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australia  and to actively encourage the elimination of discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span> in all parts of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-6-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular can the Minister advise why the police bashed <span class="highlight">women</span> and children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among those who were allegedly battered in this confrontation were a number of <span class="highlight">women</span> and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Northern Development and the Northern Territory been drawn to newspaper reports that the <span class="highlight">women</span> of Darwin are pressing for a bigger say in the reconstruction of the city because the old city had ample resources for male leisure and recreation but little for <span class="highlight">women</span> and children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As <span class="highlight">women</span> under 40 and children made up 60 per cent of the city’s population will the Minister assure the Senate that every step will be taken to consult both with the <span class="highlight">women</span> of Darwin and with professional <span class="highlight">women</span> such as architects and designers and, further, to use the expertise and assistance of all these people on the various bodies and committees set up to handle the reconstruction of Darwin? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-On behalf of the Minister I ask: How could anyone help but hear the voice of the <span class="highlight">women</span> on reconstruction or anything else? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">women</span> of Darwin have been active in making their presence felt when seeking some say in the reconstruction of Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have established an advisory group for reconstruction which, I think, includes  Dr Stack  as the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s representative for the purpose of presenting the viewpoint for the <span class="highlight">women</span> of Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators can be assured that at a time when <span class="highlight">women</span> are receiving equal pay- as they have done gradually over the last year or two- the cost factor, especially in the textile industry, obviously had to be much greater. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been a significant factor in ensuring that a lot of those <span class="highlight">women</span> unfortunately have been laid off as, indeed, have many males. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The year 1975 has been declared as International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year and $2m has been allocated to fund <span class="highlight">women</span>’s groups and promote <span class="highlight">women</span>’s causes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister understand the frustration and dissatisfaction being experienced by the National Council of Aboriginal and Island <span class="highlight">Women</span> when large sums of money are to be allocated to other <span class="highlight">women</span>’s groups in Australia and it has not received any finality in relation to its submission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-With the funding of hundreds of organisations and various activities one cannot keep track of any particular case., The National Council of Aboriginal and Island <span class="highlight">Women</span> has put in a yearly budget which is to be processed by my Department to ascertain what funds will be made available and for what activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and Immigration whether an investigation is contemplated into the circumstances in which 9 Chilean migrant <span class="highlight">women</span> were dismissed at the W. D. and H. O. Wills (Australia) Ltd tobacco factory in Sydney, particularly in view of the evasive attitude of the company which was compounded by the arrogant attitude of the personnel manager,  Mr Reidy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a result of the sacking of the Chilean <span class="highlight">women</span> the case was brought to the attention of  Mr Grassby,  the special consultant in community matters, who has been preparing a report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is possible in such an evacuation when <span class="highlight">women</span> and children are being carried it is devoutly to be desired that commercial aircraft, and not Hercules or Starlifter aircraft, be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Presently, and instantly there is employment for a number of <span class="highlight">women</span> and also school leavers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The hospital bureaucrats decided- it is a very mundane subject- that the <span class="highlight">women</span> operatives would have to fend for themselves as far as toilet facilties were concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a pretty poor situation when <span class="highlight">women</span> who have been only 6 months in Australia, many of them coming from Latin America, are confronted with this type of treatment by a Gorgonian matron or rather peculiar foreman working for the contractor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem to which I have referred was compound by the fact that the State Factory Welfare Board was not doing its job, as it should, in this International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year, by providing adequate toilet facilities in some of our big industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Will the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation tell the Senate what <span class="highlight">women</span>’s rights are under the existing repatriation legislation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the answer is no, and if he has not already done so, will he take action to ensure that any discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span> is eliminated, particularly during International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation: If there is this discrimination, be it against men or against <span class="highlight">women</span>, will he make recommendations for it to be removed, particularly during International <span class="highlight">Women</span> ‘s Year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, in most recent times reference has been made to equal pay for <span class="highlight">women</span> and 4 weeks annual leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They involve human emotions; they involve human happiness; and they involve the quality of life of some 35,000 men, <span class="highlight">women</span> and children in or near the affected area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister inform the Parliament of the amount spent with his Department by organisations advertising events associated with International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Department paid for or otherwise funded any advertising program for <span class="highlight">women</span>’s organisations in Australia in connection with Internationa] Woman’s Year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think an amount of approximately $2m has been set aside by the Government for the promotion of International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One <span class="highlight">women</span> is the organiser of the Socialist Youth Alliance and uses the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Abortion Action Coalition as a front to attract <span class="highlight">women</span> into the Socialist Youth Alliance and the Socialist Workers League. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an organisation which asked for $20,000 for International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year, as  Mr Weschler  said, so we can have 6 full-timers’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Was the Prime Minister’s adviser on <span class="highlight">women</span>’s affairs,  Ms Elizabeth  Reid, instrumental in drawing up the list of persons, including Truganini, without any reference to the Post Office Stamp Advisory Committee? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I also said that another $4,000 had been received from the organisation established under the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, to deal with International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750415_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I thought there was quite an imbalance between the number of men and the number of <span class="highlight">women</span>, and I suggested that my Department should take action to employ more <span class="highlight">women</span> journalists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I simply remind people of the important role which the average Australian can play because the War Memorial can be built up by a consciousness in the community that this sort of action would be to the benefit of the War Memorial and to the memory of those servicemen and <span class="highlight">women</span> and other people associated with the Services who lost their lives during the various actions in which Australia has been involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to draw the Senate’s attention to a letter I have received from the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Abortion Action Campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750417_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Abortion Action Coalition is simply, as the name implies, a number of <span class="highlight">women</span>, joined together in the  hopes of repealing the laws limiting abortion in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750417_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that some of the <span class="highlight">women</span> are connected with the  SYA  and  SWL. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750417_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We were not the main organising force behind the International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Day march, and we have not been organising large public meetings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750417_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We combined with many other <span class="highlight">women</span> s groups on International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Day to organise and take part in the march. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750417_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We object to being labelled as an innocent <span class="highlight">women</span>’s group being manipulated by the SYA and  SWL <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750417_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That person had indicated that those bodies were Trotskyist bodies and that the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Abortion Action Group, to which  Senator Melzer  referred, was one of the bodies which these Trotskyist organisations regarded as their own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750417_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I would be interested to know whether this <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Abortion Action group repudiates the Socialist Youth Alliance and the Socialist Workers League, particularly as it is conceded that some of the members of the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Abortion Action group are in fact members of those organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750417_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we got from him tonight was that a person told him- there is no identification of that person and no verification of whether a person ever did tell him- that someone who was a member of the Socialist Youth Alliance and the Socialist Workers League was also a member of the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Abortion Action Coalition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750417_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that rightfully the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Abortion Action Coalition has protested at the allegation that it was associated with those other groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750417_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It does not matter whether they are <span class="highlight">women</span> with an ideal who are demonstrating, if they can be used for his cause  Senator Greenwood  will use them without verification of or justification for the utterances he makes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750417_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Greenwood  accepted this newspaper’s highly coloured story of this man going to bed with <span class="highlight">women</span> in order to get their secrets from them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As it is International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year, I wish to draw the attention of the Senate to various incidents which show how diligent a government must be and how difficult it is, until one actually has legislation to enforce an idea, to bring people to realise that they have a blind spot and that when it comes to matters such as discrimination between the sexes, unfortunately, a deal of discrimination still exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter that I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate concern discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As this year has been designated International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year, it is well for governments to realise the extent of that problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been brought to my attention that in some areas the people who are interviewing <span class="highlight">women</span> for this retraining scheme are getting very close to the knuckle by asking those <span class="highlight">women</span> for personal details about themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am afraid that in many instances in which government departments appoint officers overseas <span class="highlight">women</span> find it very difficult to secure such overseas appointments and married <span class="highlight">women</span> find it practically impossible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many instances, in interviews for such appointments <span class="highlight">women</span> applicants are asked whether their husbands are happy about the prospect of their going overseas, whether it is the husband’s wish that the woman should go overseas and whether the husband will find suitable work and be happy in the country to which the appointee will be posted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Perhaps I should have; perhaps a number of other <span class="highlight">women</span> in the community should have this matter brought to their attention, whether they like it or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If <span class="highlight">women</span> who work for the Board of Works marry they have to resign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The same Board of Works lays down conditions of dress for its <span class="highlight">women</span> employees to wear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless the <span class="highlight">women</span> wear the uniform that is picked out for them they are liable to be sacked because it is said they are not amenable to discipline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">women</span> wear a blue dress and a blue cardigan probably because the members of the Board, being men, think blue is the loveliest colour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously this employer does not take into account the fact that so many families now are 2-income families and that so many <span class="highlight">women</span> do not work to fill in idle hours; they go to work because they have to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These examples give some idea of the immense problems that still have to be faced by this Government because for a long time nobody has worried about the real equality of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force or in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We look forward with confidence to the day when <span class="highlight">women</span> go forward, not as someone’s daughter, wife, mother or secretary but in their own right as whole and complete human beings with much to offer this world in general and our country in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will be aware, of course, that discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span> is nothing new in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is perhaps best described as a ‘hangover from medieval times’ when <span class="highlight">women</span> were considered less valuable even than the household animals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, it is not long ago, it is claimed, that <span class="highlight">women</span> were given the vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Financial institutions tend to regard <span class="highlight">women</span> less favourably than their male counterparts when they want to borrow money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet I put it to you,  Mr Deputy President,  that a lot of <span class="highlight">women</span> in this day and age would be more financially stable than their male counterparts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A group of <span class="highlight">women</span> desired to have a drink in a bar of a hotel and they were told that it was a public bar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A public bar is for the use of the public and yet this group of <span class="highlight">women</span> was told by the management that it was for males only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> were required to drink in another part of the hotel where they also had to pay more for their liquor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we are looking at discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span> in general we cannot bypass what happens in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Mr Deputy President, I put it to you that any male who would make such a fatuous statement as that would never have seen <span class="highlight">women</span> at work in a supermarket. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any man who says that a woman is incapable of lifting heavy loads and files of paper must have rocks in his head when one considers the work the <span class="highlight">women</span> do in the supermarket. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Things are really bad in Australia- 200 000 declared unemployed are official, but unofficially 100 000 more, especially <span class="highlight">women</span> have not registered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It refers to the fundamental human rights, the dignity and rights of a human person and the equal rights of men and <span class="highlight">women</span>, and of nations large and small. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That little union of prejudiced men and <span class="highlight">women</span> practising as doctors, aided and abetted by conservative governments, denied any opportunity to these people, who were more eminent in many respects than those who were practising medicine in this country, solely because they were displaced persons from war-torn Europe, to carry out their profession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand it was basically a march of <span class="highlight">women</span> by <span class="highlight">women</span> for <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You see this happening time after time in respect of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s fashions and how they look after their faces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People come here and say that the skin of Australian <span class="highlight">women</span> is the worst in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister tell me whether there is any difference between the benefits enjoyed by men who served with any of the defence forces during the last war and those enjoyed by <span class="highlight">women</span> who served in any of the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s auxiliary services during that period? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is one difference which I think I pointed out some time earlier this year in answer to a question by  Senator Coleman  about repatriation benefits, and that is that the widows of male veterans are entitled to war widow benefits whereas the widowers of deceased <span class="highlight">women</span> veterans are not entitled to similar benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They began at a time when it was quite uncommon for <span class="highlight">women</span> to be earning incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These changes include a growing number of families where both parents work, and of single parent families, as well as a frequently increasing sense of isolation affecting <span class="highlight">women</span> looking after children at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will permit those intentions to be translated even further into action and it will be yet another example, and a major one at that, of the recognition by this Government of the rights of <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is with conviction that we are taking steps to introduce this legislation during International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been given emphasis by people who question opportunities in education and who question the role of <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would see the Curriculum Development Centre as having an opportunity in this area to do some national project work- the sort of work that would place emphasis on the fact that it is preferable that a society sees the need to develop to the full the talents and skills of all its people and does not segregate them into traditional roles or limit the opportunities which some of the <span class="highlight">women</span> of this country may find ahead of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She attacked the whole problem of racial discrimination on the basis of sexualism that is to say, <span class="highlight">women</span> are a deprived element in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Racial discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span> as a sexual problem will not be remedied by passing laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am dealing now with arguments put by <span class="highlight">women</span>’s lib organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the father leaves to go walkabout he knows full well that the <span class="highlight">women</span> and children will be looked after by the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He would also no doubt be aware that the program is produced and presented entirely by <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister tell the Senate whether this is a genuine attempt by the ABC to involve <span class="highlight">women</span> in all aspects of program production and presentation, or is it just a sop to International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The show apparently has resulted from a <span class="highlight">women</span>’s workshop program within the ABC which has been designed to give any female ABC staff member a chance to participate in all aspects of program making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One basic aim of the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s workshop program is to involve <span class="highlight">women</span> in more technical fields with the result that typists, librarians and other staff engaged in that sort of activity will become producers, technical operators and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An ABC <span class="highlight">women</span>’s co-operative has been formed to organise the venture with workshop results being channelled into a weekly radio program that  Senator Melzer  has referred to as ‘The Coming Out, Ready or Not Show’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am told by the Commission that 2 female staff employees have been seconded from their usual work to co-ordinate the project and that they will be travelling to other States to encourage <span class="highlight">women</span> to form similar workshops elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am told that as a result of this co-operative over 200 <span class="highlight">women</span> are attending radio workshops, 50 of them on a television course, and that there is a steadily growing waiting list. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, the Australian Government, which is committed to a policy of housing all Aboriginal families, whatever requirements they meet, within 10 years from the time of elections, has provided funds to the Western Australian Government for a housekeeping service whereby <span class="highlight">women</span> who are employed for the purpose will visit the homes and try to instruct the tenants as to how properly to look after a European home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is most appropriate in International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year to honour her as a great Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Convention to which I have referred takes up this reference to the community’s role and the role of men and <span class="highlight">women</span> in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have become angry young men and angry young <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of past discrimination and things that have happened in the past, a group of young Aboriginal men and <span class="highlight">women</span> could become angry, and outside this place they could shout, ‘Down with the whitey ‘, or something about some race of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main impetus for their establishment has been that there has been a requirement for <span class="highlight">women</span> in the workforce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been modified in the last 10 years or so by the increasing exercise by <span class="highlight">women</span> of their right to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ‘<span class="highlight">Women</span> in the Workforce’ series released in the late 1960s by the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Bureau of the Department of Labor, which was a Bureau established by  Mr Snedden  when he was the Minister, was a step in the right direction but this has not been followed through subsequently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst we are not in any way denying the right of <span class="highlight">women</span> to choose to work, nor are we failing to recognise the need for many <span class="highlight">women</span> to work, we wish to remind the Government of the importance to a child of having its mother able to look after it rather than having some substitute care provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister said also:   it will be yet another example, and a major one at that, of the recognition by this Government of the rights of <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To take a somewhat gratuitous approach to the rights of <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australian society during International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year is perhaps not something that is welcomed by the thoughtful <span class="highlight">women</span> of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To relate any provision of child care simply to the <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australian society overlooks the fact that both parents have equal responsibilities in the care of their children and that the children have the fundamental and essential rights which are part of the Declaration of Human Rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government claims that the establishment of a Children’s Commission is a further recognition by the Government of the rights of <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not saying that the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s place is in the home, but I am saying that she should not be forced out of her home by government mismanagement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, on the reverse basis, for <span class="highlight">women</span> in that condition, subject to the viciousness of cruelty, drunkenness, misbehaviour physically, perversion or any of those things, to have to wait for 12 months after a separation before getting a sufficient remedy is a very great injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other aspect I was about to get on to  is  from the woman’s point of view, which is of particular interest to me from the humanitarian angle, and thinking of not every <span class="highlight">women</span> being one of those liberated people who can earn $lm whenever they feel like it, or so they say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> will have equal employment rights and opportunities as men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I strongly supported the Prime Minister when he said that the Government will encourage the AGIC to extend to <span class="highlight">women</span> the same opportunity to take out policies as men now enjoy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Many men and <span class="highlight">women</span> devote their working lives to the railways and they have collectively formed some of the finest traditions in any government service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Transport  (Mr Charles Jones)  is also arranging for detailed discussions with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and officers of the railway unions to establish methods of consultation and liaison which will ensure all railwaymen and <span class="highlight">women</span> are fully informed on the progress of the transfer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable senators, I present a report on a survey conducted for the Young <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Christian Association by Robin Anderson with assistance from Sheryl Ward entitled: ‘Leisure- An Inappropriate Concept for <span class="highlight">Women</span>?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This situation in Australian society is tending to become reversed in that the Public Service, with great respect to a body of fine men and <span class="highlight">women</span>, is tending not only to receive higher pay and higher benefits but also to retain better security of employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>37 to clause 83 when <span class="highlight">women</span> throughout the world are having to fight for recognition as equal human beings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senators on the benches opposite are the very people who will try, by fair means or foul, to turn all <span class="highlight">women</span> back into pumpkins at the end of International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The staff ceiling limit that was imposed was later eased and accordingly some months ago one of the two <span class="highlight">women</span> remaining, who was previously on part-time only, was advised that she would be appointed permanently to the vacant full-time position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Productions like Seven Little Australians’, ‘Marion’, ‘Rush’ and now ‘Certain <span class="highlight">Women</span>’ have all been sold on the export market, which seems to evidence that these things can be done when shows are properly and effectively produced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is one very good reason why the ABC has been able to increase its .list of successful productions such as ‘Seven Little Australians ‘, ‘ Rush ‘, ‘ Marion ‘, ‘ Certain <span class="highlight">Women</span> ‘-to name a few- all of which have been sold by Australia on the export market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister confer with the Attorney-General to determine whether the same remissions can be extended to <span class="highlight">women</span> and minors in prison in Australia, also as a gesture of leniency in recognition of International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) I am aware that a number of reports suggesting an increased incidence of spontaneous abortions and congenital malformations of offspring of pregnant <span class="highlight">women</span> exposed to volatile anaesthetics in operating theatres have appeared in medical literature over the last few years; the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) is currently reviewing the subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She was also vitally involved in the role of <span class="highlight">women</span> in politics and in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was she who first suggested that the Government should set up a <span class="highlight">women</span>’s secton within the Department of Labor and Immigration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This honour has been accepted by <span class="highlight">women</span> from both political sides of Federal Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She had been active, of course, in the Australian <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s National League and in the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s sections of the Liberal Party after the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s National League disbanded in 1945. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She was, I think, one of the first <span class="highlight">women</span> chairmen of committees appointed by the Australian Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>She has written into the history of the Liberal Party and I think it will be recognised that she has written into the history of <span class="highlight">women</span> in political activity in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She knew that <span class="highlight">women</span> needed to be integrated into the political system if they were to have the influence that we believe Australian <span class="highlight">women</span> should have in political life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to place on record her long service as  President  of the Australian <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Liberal Club, which was very active during her presidency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I have spoken on this subject a number of times I feel constrained to do so this evening in this debate because I am the only <span class="highlight">women</span> who will be speaking on this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular I question whether <span class="highlight">women</span>, who make up more than 50 per cent of the total population of this country, are aware of some of the discriminatory clauses in most of those policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Young <span class="highlight">women</span> can and do mature- physically at least- as early as 1 1 or 12 years of age, and that is a perfectly normal occurrence . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For an insurance company, or anyone else for that matter, to deny <span class="highlight">women</span> their rights because of that normal maturation process is nothing short of criminal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one appears to have complained about it, except a handful of <span class="highlight">women</span> who are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already said that more than 50 per cent of the entire population of this nation are <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are bound to be some who have or could develop some disability resulting from pregnancy or childbirth, or even both; but all <span class="highlight">women</span> are not in that category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet all <span class="highlight">women</span> are penalised by the restrictive clauses in insurance policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat: That clause is included in a personal accident and illness insurance policy dated this year, this enlightened year, this International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year, 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at another aspect of insurance and discrimination as far as <span class="highlight">women</span> are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, we <span class="highlight">women</span> are the weaker sex. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  has said, in addition to referring to employment opportunities for <span class="highlight">women</span>, that the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government will encourage the AGIC to extend to <span class="highlight">women</span> the same opportunity to take out policies as men now enjoy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many <span class="highlight">women</span> do work in that way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are a professional who is paid a fee for service, if you are a musician, an artist or a singer or if you work in the area of advertising- if you work not for a full 12 months but on a fee for service basis- and on top of all those things or any of them you have the audacity to be a woman, at the moment you need not expect to be able to get coverage from an insurance company because the policies specifically state that <span class="highlight">women</span> are excluded if they work on a commission, fee for service or part time basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder just how many <span class="highlight">women</span> who earn their living as doctors and are paid a fee for service are aware of those discriminatory clauses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet it is only the <span class="highlight">women</span> who are excluded from insurance cover if they work on a part time basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many <span class="highlight">women</span> work on a door-to-door commission sales basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> who operate the party plan system throughout our communities are paid either a fee or on a commission basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A male who works on a door-to-door sales commission basis can obtain insurance coverage, but the <span class="highlight">women</span> are not entitled to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am rather shocked and disturbed to find that many <span class="highlight">women</span> do not even appear to be aware of the discriminatory clauses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am shocked and disturbed that the men who work with those <span class="highlight">women</span>, who live with those <span class="highlight">women</span> and who rear those <span class="highlight">women</span>, have not done much about the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us examine the formal discrimination that is normally shown to <span class="highlight">women</span> when, among other things, they want to take out insurance policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very few <span class="highlight">women</span> have ever been able to become more than an officer, which is slightly higher than a clerk, but is possibly considered to be a reasonably high appointment for a woman in the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think approximately three or four <span class="highlight">women</span> have actually been able to become actuaries and are still operating in that capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that more <span class="highlight">women</span> will have the opportunity to be in on the decision making side of insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She would seem to me to be somewhat of a latter day Germain Greer because she has been expounding the cause of <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the view that there are some areas in which <span class="highlight">women</span> are discriminated against and I believe that those matters ought to be corrected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a high regard for <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that <span class="highlight">women</span> have a very important role to play in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously honourable senators on the other side do not regard <span class="highlight">women</span> as I regard them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe very strongly that the 8 million policy holders, many of whom would be <span class="highlight">women</span>, would be very anxious to preserve the capacity of those insurance companies to invest their money in order to provide policy holders with the bonuses to which they are entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words the Liberal-Country Party Opposition seems to take the view that it is just too bad for those who suffer a disadvantage as a result of any experience, any unforeseen circumstance, any accident of any illness, which  Senator Coleman  referred to yesterday as specifically applying to <span class="highlight">women</span>, if in fact the insurance companies say: ‘We will not cover such an eventuality’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of the evidence presented, does the Minister believe that the prescription of such preparations by medical practitioners needs to be reviewed, and that in association with this, more educational information needs to be provided for <span class="highlight">women</span> who are using oral contraceptives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-64-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">women</span> were exposed to significantly greater numbers of a variety of hormonal preparations given for various reasons during pregnancy, compared to the exposure suffered by a control group of mothers having normal children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-64-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That an Australian Government Insurance Corporation will benefit all Australian <span class="highlight">women</span> and men by offering equal opportunity for employment and insurance cover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-1-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill will also remove the discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span> wage earners which is in the present legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister whether he is aware that very little material concerning the <span class="highlight">Women</span> in Politics’ conference has been distributed among <span class="highlight">women</span> in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islands communities in Queensland? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he aware that Queensland Aboriginal and Island <span class="highlight">women</span> have organised their own International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year seminar to be held at Townsville this weekend? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I address my question to the Special Minister of State who I understand is the Minister administering the financial aspects in regard to International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister able to provide the Senate with a detailed account of the items on which moneys have been expended or authorised to be expended as part of the Government’s allocation of $2m for International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact that my Department provides the administrative support for the National Advisory Committee on International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year which as a body is responsible to the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year some $2m was made available by the Australian Government to that committee for purposes of International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister would be aware that the Government sent a delegation to the United Nations Conference on <span class="highlight">Women</span> that was held in Mexico this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ex-servicemen and <span class="highlight">women</span> can expect this year to have expenditure on health costs increased by $12. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also refused to recognise for treatment cancer which had been contracted by ex-servicemen and <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the men and <span class="highlight">women</span> in the Services will retain their separate entities but will be responsible to the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, if the Committee itself seeks out and finds defects, are we not men and <span class="highlight">women</span> enough to look at those defects and to correct them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not go out for migrants, <span class="highlight">women</span>, Aboriginals or 2-headed goats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, one would think that a Liberal-Country Party government would have taken into account that there are children, that there are parents and that there are <span class="highlight">women</span> who live in extraordinarily isolated circumstances and who have as much right to a good education and to converse with their fellows as has anybody else, but what did it do about it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are Opposition senators suggesting that pensions paid to ex-servicemen and <span class="highlight">women</span>, which have risen in the comparative 3 year period by some 54 per cent, or the war widows pension, which has risen by some 80 per cent, or the single rate age and invalid pension, which has risen by 93 per cent, or the married couples pension, which has risen by 87 per cent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also know that last year and this year $2,300,000 has been voted for International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year and for the gabble that is going on around this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody who saw  Monday Conference  the other night would wonder just why those <span class="highlight">women</span> are here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The way they are talking, one would think that there was a great division between men and <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one who has always had a very high appreciation of <span class="highlight">women</span> because of the wonderful mother I had, it disgusts me to hear the sort of nonsense they go on with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What has this <span class="highlight">women</span> Reid, who is the chief adviser to the Prime Minister on <span class="highlight">women</span>’s affairs, done for the money that she is getting? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the type of woman who is appointed as the chief adviser on <span class="highlight">women</span>’s affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Sometimes these people are called the ordinary men and <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the present Conference on <span class="highlight">Women</span> and Politics needs no better demonstration of how the Australian Press and the Opposition are unwilling to judge a woman on her merits and how they seek to sensationalise the routine appointment of <span class="highlight">women</span> to public jobs on the basis of totally irrelevant matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before 1 January of this year the Anzac Agency of the British Commonwealth War Graves Commission had responsibility for the care and maintenance of the graves of Australian servicemen and <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that these proposed arrangements for the care of the graves of Australian servicemen and <span class="highlight">women</span> have been favourably received by the various veterans organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the Media, and indeed the Minister representing him in this place, would be aware that because this is International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year the Australian Broadcasting Commission made time and facilities available to <span class="highlight">women</span> employed in the ABC to produce a radio program entitled  The Coming Out Ready Or Not Show. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The decision to establish the radio program  The Coming Out Ready Or Not Show  was taken by the Australian Broadcasting Commission itself in conformity with the general conception that this year is International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that a seminar is intended to be conducted by the Department of the Media on the role of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the media in this year, International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It teaches that the wealth of a society should be administered in the interest of all; that every one of us, men, <span class="highlight">women</span> and children, has an equal stake in our community, and equal duty to it- to do our best- and an equal right to share in its fruits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position is grossly understated because the Government does not include in the figures <span class="highlight">women</span> married to an employed breadwinner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps they were concerned that <span class="highlight">women</span> in New South Wales might be enlightened enough to take some action against the publican. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They might have thought that the following Saturday afternoon <span class="highlight">women</span> would go to the saloon bar of the Stop and Rest Hotel; decide to stay there; refuse to leave and not go into the lounge where they would be required to pay more; and have a sit down strike especially as the female bar attendant who would serve them had had the audacity under instructions, presumably from the licensee, to request that another member of her sex leave the house or that part of the house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for the Media: How many <span class="highlight">women</span> employed in the Australian Information Service now represent Australia overseas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is a statement of the previous Minister for the Media that more <span class="highlight">women</span> will be posted to Australian Information Service posts overseas as soon as they have completed language training in accordance with the policy of the present Minister for the Media? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I was Minister for the Media I was commencing to institute a system whereby <span class="highlight">women</span> journalists in the employ of the Australian Information Service would be posted to Australian Information Service posts abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Minister for the Media has advised me that he is in complete agreement with the policy of posting overseas <span class="highlight">women</span> serving in the Australian Information Service but that no <span class="highlight">women</span> are presently employed in language training courses as a preparation for overseas appointments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is expected that in the near future some <span class="highlight">women</span> will be posted to English speaking countries where a second language is not required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is the first occasion on which I have spoken in the debate on the motion that the Senate do now adjourn, but I feel obliged to seek this opportunity to put on record a few facts in relation to some statements which have appeared in the newspapers over the last couple of days on the subject of the Queensland Government and the <span class="highlight">women</span> of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Glaring headlines were given in the newspapers yesterday and more coverage was given again today to a statement by Miss Elizabeth Reid, the former adviser of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  on <span class="highlight">women</span> ‘s affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a pity that they are being written off by people who are not prepared to acknowledge the contribution of <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Miss Reid stated also that  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  had not enabled <span class="highlight">women</span> to hold high places or high office under the policies of the National-Liberal Government in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If she has made the activity of the Queensland Government in the area of legislation on <span class="highlight">women</span> her business, she did not reveal it in the Press statements that appeared Australia wide yesterday and today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1973 the Minister for Justice in Queensland,  Mr Bill  Knox, set up a Commission of Inquiry into the Status of <span class="highlight">Women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While many <span class="highlight">women</span> welcomed it, it was not in response to any specific pressure or request from <span class="highlight">women</span> or from any group within the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This commission of inquiry was asked to recommend to the State Government areas in which legislation or policy initiatives were needed, which would combat any complaint based on fact about disadvantage to <span class="highlight">women</span> in Queensland, insofar as the State Government is capable of legislating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That commission had 4 members- 2 men and 2 <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most controversial, probably so far as the public and the Parliament were concerned, but which was carried by an overwhelming majority, was a Bill to ensure that <span class="highlight">women</span> are not required to state their marital status on legal documents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall take it as implicit that the ladies and gentlemen of this chamber realise the significance and the great importance of that Bill to <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Queensland <span class="highlight">women</span> have served on juries for a number of years, but they were able to claim certain special exemptions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> in Queensland serve on juries, in response to their stated desire, on exactly the same terms as men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since that legislation was passed there have already been several juries in Queensland comprised entirely of <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its election promises the Government also committed itself to a policy of ensuring that <span class="highlight">women</span> would be appointed to all Government boards and advisory bodies, wherever there is a woman in the State who is capable of contributing to such a board or such a body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So much for Miss Reid ‘s statement about reluctance to have <span class="highlight">women</span> in high places. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consumer affairs is an area in which <span class="highlight">women</span> are particularly involved since they are major consumers on behalf of the families in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More recently the Government took another initiative which was not a recommendation of that commission of inquiry but which was a very important one and one which has been welcomed by all <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The area of estate duty has been one which has been particularly cruel to <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its implementation has shown the poor recognition that previous governments have given to the economic status of <span class="highlight">women</span> in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Queensland is the State which leads the way there and recognises that in that area some very simple justice is due to <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably one of the most important initiatives, in my opinion, and one which refutes Miss Reid, was the setting up by the Government- again as a direct result of a specific recommendation of the Commission of Inquiry into the Status of <span class="highlight">Women</span>- of a body called the Council of Queensland <span class="highlight">Women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the principal advisory body to the Government on issues as they affect the <span class="highlight">women</span> of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">women</span> work with the State Government to advise it and they are not therefore, as somebody might suggest, lackeys of a National Country Party-Liberal government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the contrary, when the Government moved to set up this Council it invited any <span class="highlight">women</span> of Queensland who were interested to serve on the Council and, who thought they may have qualifications to assist the Council’s deliberations, to nominate themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government did not select those <span class="highlight">women</span> whose opinions it knew would conveniently fit in with its own opinions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did not require that groups should nominate the <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It recognised that there are many <span class="highlight">women</span> in the community who have much which is worthwhile to contribute and who have opinions which are valuable, particularly in the area ofthe needs of the family in our community and who do not necessarily, as a direct result of those commitments, have the time to become heavily involved in community groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the many hundreds of <span class="highlight">women</span> who nominated themselves the State Government made a choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion it has made a quite successful attempt to get together a combination of individuals in employment, the professions, the arts, politics, community and welfare activities and <span class="highlight">women</span> who just occupy the traditional role of homemaker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It sought to ensure that <span class="highlight">women</span> from all parts of the State were represented on that Council, which is particularly important in a State such as Queensland where size and distances can invoke very particular problems for special regions of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not propose to give all the names of the <span class="highlight">women</span> on the Council because I do not have all the individual names. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the <span class="highlight">women</span> were not nominated by groups it is interesting to look at the sort of groups to which the <span class="highlight">women</span> who are now on that Council belong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is the State  President  of the Liberal <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are <span class="highlight">women</span> from the Queensland Country <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Association and from the National Council of <span class="highlight">Women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the  President  of the Queensland Status of <span class="highlight">Women</span> Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a representative from the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Employment Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are representatives from the Business and Professional <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Club, Quota Clubs, the College of Ophthalmologists, the Good Shepherd Lodge, and the Girl Guides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hoped that she would succeed in her job and that the <span class="highlight">women</span> of Australian would reap some benefit from it, but I was critical of the administrative tactics of the Government in this type of appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the reasons that I think some <span class="highlight">women</span> in the community have criticised Miss Reid, sometimes unfairly, is that they feared that one person’s opinion was to be foisted on all <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> have a characteristic in common with the community at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not saying that Miss Reid has necessarily tried to do that but I contrast it with the very genuine attempts by the Queensland Government to try to gather together the opinion of <span class="highlight">women</span> in Queensland in a way which would benefit all <span class="highlight">women</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been no objection to the composition of that Council of Queensland <span class="highlight">Women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been welcomed by <span class="highlight">women</span> of all groups and of all political persuasions in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He provoked Miss Reid by some outrageous statements concerning the variety of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s organisations which have been sponsored and assisted by this Government since it came to power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely  Senator Martin  will not deny the initiatives which this Government has take on behalf of the rights of <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They advocate the sale of <span class="highlight">women</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>We only need to recall that  Senator Martin  was here to answer an allegation which was patently stupid and false, namely, the work which the NationalLiberal Party Government in Queensland has done in the area of <span class="highlight">women</span> and their advancement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-On 27 August 1975  (Hansard  page 274)  Senator Keeffe  asked me, as Minister representing the Prime Minister, a question without notice concerning Aboriginal <span class="highlight">women</span> and the recent <span class="highlight">Women</span> and Politics Conference in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751007_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-55-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Information concerning the <span class="highlight">Women</span> and Politics Conference was sent through the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to Aboriginal <span class="highlight">women</span>’s groups and to those Aboriginal organisations in country areas which were considered to have a particular interest in the Conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751007_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-55-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In many cases the organisations were also contacted personally by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to encourage the participation of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751007_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-55-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The development of those programs has been greatly assisted by nearly 1000 experts, both men, and <span class="highlight">women</span> from all over Australia who have given their time and energies freely to the work of those committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the sexist organisation of our society has many more important ramifications than the fact that there are not many <span class="highlight">women</span> members in Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Until very recently, <span class="highlight">women</span> in our society, through a variety of formal barriers, traditional prejudice, and sheer neglect by policy makers, were denied equal access with men to education, health care, job training, employment, wage justice- in all, to the possibility of real independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 1973, the Henderson Inquiry into Poverty estimated that there were approximately 132 000 fatherless families- that is, families supported by <span class="highlight">women</span>- in Australia at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, half the families supported by <span class="highlight">women</span> were poor or very poor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Figures from the 1971 census showed that 80.7 per cent of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force had no qualifications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But 1.9 per cent of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force have trade qualifications as compared with 20.3 per cent of males. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The child care survey in 1973 showed that a quarter of a million <span class="highlight">women</span> with dependent children aged 12 or under were in the work force and about 125 000 <span class="highlight">women</span> with dependent children under 6 years of age were in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These few statistics should remind honourable senators who need to be reminded that in education, training, employment and income, most <span class="highlight">women</span> have been seriously disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When setting about the immense task of creating a just society based on an equitable distribution of power and resources, the Labor Government did not overlook the inequities suffered by <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For the first time all <span class="highlight">women</span> who, for any reason, were the sole support of children were entitled to a modest level of government assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it ironical and very disappointing that this long overdue measure- the first step towards giving supporting mothers a modicum of independence and dignity- has been questioned by some adherents of the Liberal philosophy on the grounds that it may be creating an unhealthy dependency in these <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More than half the applicants under this program have been <span class="highlight">women</span> thus demonstrating to honourable senators on the other side of the chamber who need to have this pointed out to them that <span class="highlight">women</span>, when given the opportunity, are in fact anxious to acquire skills that lead to independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The application of the means test introduced by the present Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations,  Mr Tony  Street, and the reduction in training allowance represents a positive disincentive to retrain for <span class="highlight">women</span> of low dual-income families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such <span class="highlight">women</span> are usually the first to be retrenched. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Minister will give further thought to this anomaly and that he will re-establish positive incentives for training, particularly for <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1974 the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission extended the minimum wage to <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The injustice to <span class="highlight">women</span> implicit in the concept of the male breadwinner, which was first applied by Justice Higgins in the Conciliation and Arbitration Court in 1907, has finally been removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I point out that in speaking of working <span class="highlight">women</span> I am not speaking of a small group or of a group of recent origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Working class <span class="highlight">women</span> have always worked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, between 1904 and 1910 <span class="highlight">women</span> constituted about one-third of the employees in factories and workshops in the Sydney metropolitan district. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under the Whitlam Government <span class="highlight">women</span> were given access to wage justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But a number of steps remain before wage justice becomes a reality for all working <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have mentioned those of relevance to <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But honourable senators may agree that improvements in education, training, legal aid services, welfare services and child-care, benefit the whole of society and not just <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many thousands of men and <span class="highlight">women</span> throughout Australia give one and sometimes more days a week to local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We all have a great admiration for those men and <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us turn our attention to <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What does the Speech say about <span class="highlight">women</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government is firmly committed to furthering the equality of opportunity for <span class="highlight">women</span> in education, employment and in public life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will encourage the full participation of <span class="highlight">women</span> in all aspects of Australian life u&gt; ensure that their contribution of skills and talents is used lo the full. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth Public Service Superannuation Scheme to be introduced shortly has been amended to make better provision for <span class="highlight">women</span> employed by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What about the majority of <span class="highlight">women</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What about the most discriminated against of all <span class="highlight">women</span> in this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Married <span class="highlight">women</span> should have a true freedom of choice but they should not be forced through economic circumstances- and that is the situation at present- to go out to work in order to maintain a decent standard of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why were married <span class="highlight">women</span> forced into the workforce? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a deliberate plan by the employers and the then government in the 1 960s, together with the Department of Labour and National Service, to recruit married <span class="highlight">women</span> into the workforce as a source of cheap labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the trade union movement- nobody else, but the trade union movement- won the true equal pay case in 1973, a situation developed where, because minimum wages had not been raised to acceptable levels many of those <span class="highlight">women</span> remained in the workforce simply to maintain family economic standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It must be remembered that people in this category are not all elderly pensionersit includes <span class="highlight">women</span> with small childrenand the public hospital may be a long way away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many people, particularly <span class="highlight">women</span> with small children in the household, go to their doctor with some regularity and are given many prescriptions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We sat under the trees at the Aurukun Mission surrounded by some 500 or 600 Aboriginal people- men, <span class="highlight">women</span> and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there are some of these unscrupulous men and they go on to the Aboriginal community, which is a group of 700 unsophisticated simple-living people, with flagons of wine and with certain thoughts in their minds and they do take advantage of some of the young men and perhaps some of the young <span class="highlight">women</span>, what protection are the Aboriginal people going to have from that kind of behaviour? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall refer to the cuts that are being made in just some of the schemes that are dear to my heart because they have done something for that depressed area of Australia’s population- the <span class="highlight">women</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a scheme that was designed to provide training for varying types of people- not only <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was another scheme that was designed to deal just with getting <span class="highlight">women</span> back into the workforce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gave some hope not only to <span class="highlight">women</span> who had been out of the workforce and who wanted to go back and be retrained but also to <span class="highlight">women</span> who knew that they were going to have the responsibility of raising their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of them were <span class="highlight">women</span> who were on their own and who were going to have the responsibility of raising their family and some of them were <span class="highlight">women</span> who knew that, because of the type of man to whom they were married, they would always have to accept part of the responsibility of looking after their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To so many of these <span class="highlight">women</span> for so long the earning of some money was better than earning no money at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were even single <span class="highlight">women</span> who were keeping their children and who wanted to go on keeping their children without having to do what perhaps their mothers had done and go out and shop for a husband. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So many of these <span class="highlight">women</span> cannot possibly go on in that area existing on some $24 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was said in some areas that a Federal pension could make many young <span class="highlight">women</span> permanently dependent on welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole manufacturing and industrial section of this country would come to a standstill if those <span class="highlight">women</span> stayed at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To demonstrate how many <span class="highlight">women</span> are engaged in the workforce at the moment I would like to quote from a document entitled  Girls, School and Society,  which was a report to the Schools Commission, in which it is said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A quarter of a million <span class="highlight">women</span> with dependent children aged 12 or under were in the labour force in 1 973 - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know the figures have gone up since then-  and about 12S 000 <span class="highlight">women</span> with dependent children under 6 were in the labour force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am waiting with interest to see what the Government does about equal pay for <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It introduced equal pay for <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some allegations were made during the last Federal election campaign, and never denied, that confidential talks had taken place with employers who employed large numbers of <span class="highlight">women</span> and that certain things had been said about terminating equal pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say to them: You just try to knock back equal pay and take us back to the days when <span class="highlight">women</span> received 60 per cent of the male wage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of claims by the so-called  Deputy  Governor of the Indonesian-held areas of East Timor that 60 000 people, mostly <span class="highlight">women</span> and children, have been massacred by Indonesian troops or so-called volunteers, I ask: What protests have been made to the neo-fascist Government of Indonesia by the Australian Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-47-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In an interview given to several Indonesian newspapers in Jakarta on 12 February,  Mr Lopez  da Cruz, a leader of the UDT party in East Timor, was reported as stating that there had been some 50 000-60 000 casualties since the outbreak of fighting in East Timor, many of them <span class="highlight">women</span> and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-47-5">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If my mathematics are correct, 4 Ministers from the Liberal Party and 3 Ministers from the National Country Party are employing <span class="highlight">women</span> in top positions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the labels which are occasionally placed on people, I thought that I ought to make available the names of Ministers who currently employ <span class="highlight">women</span> in top jobs in ministerial offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like now to speak briefly about some matters affecting <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I replied then, and I still maintain, that <span class="highlight">women</span>’s issues are Australia’s issues and Australia’s issues are <span class="highlight">women</span>’s issues and any problems must be dealt with by all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We <span class="highlight">women</span> are not an underprivileged minority group as the radical feminists would have us depicted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australia are equal with our menfolk, and only those who wish to denigrate our sex would have us believe otherwise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, one thing we must fight is not our male population but ourselves; for the only things standing in the way of <span class="highlight">women</span> are the psychological barriers we ourselves impose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But we cannot change society’s attitude overnight, and to try to do so only harms the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are now drawing to the end of International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing is certain: It has brought <span class="highlight">women</span> to notice more than any other single event has ever done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To me, the conference in Mexico City was successful in that it pointed out the diverse problems of <span class="highlight">women</span> all over the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> from the underdeveloped nations were quite at a loss to understand the militant western <span class="highlight">women</span>’s attitude to matters they thought were trivial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">women</span> from the western world were unable to comprehend, far less sit and listen, to such simple demands; for here in Australia we already have this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So the feminist activists have in our country turned the full circle and are no longer interested in assisting <span class="highlight">women</span> in the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here I would like to quote Elizabeth Reid, the former adviser on <span class="highlight">women</span>’s affairs to the previous Prime Minister, who said that to assist <span class="highlight">women</span> in the home: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>is one of the most backward steps that could happen to the <span class="highlight">women</span> ‘s movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It’s one of the most effective means of keeping <span class="highlight">women</span> where the fascists think we ought to be- in the house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This statement expresses more clearly than anything else could the lack of comprehension of some of the <span class="highlight">women</span> activists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Governments have, over the years, assisted <span class="highlight">women</span> to enter the work force through subsidies to child care centres, maternity leave and retraining schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is this meagre allowance that induces <span class="highlight">women</span> to put their children into child care centres and join the work force to keep up with the Joneses- the working sisters with their ever-increasing financial commitments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">women</span> are to remain in the home they need to be given realistic endowment so that they have money of their own and can feel the same independence as that of their working counterparts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s stated intention of continuing financial assistance to voluntary welfare organisations will be welcomed by the Young Men’s Christian Association, the Young <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Christian Association, the Northern Territory Council for Social Services and other agencies at present operating in the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Guilfoyle  said- I agree with this-that it is futile to expect <span class="highlight">women</span> who are working in factories all day and at home all night to go out to night school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations will be aware that many men and <span class="highlight">women</span> presently training under the National Employment and Training Scheme are about to be forced to take a wage cut- in fact, a cut of approximately $68 or $70 in their weekly income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many young men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who have a tertiary education probably are unable to obtain a job in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the debate on the Address-in-Reply a few remarks have been made about <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Debates have taken place in this chamber about the role of <span class="highlight">women</span> in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that  Senator Walters  made a very interesting and worthwhile contribution- interesting because in my experience it certainly reflected the attitudes of many Australian <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember that  Senator Walters  said something about the need for an increase in child endowment to enable <span class="highlight">women</span> to stay at home, if they so choose, to look after their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator O  ‘Byrne would need to have a little more contact with Australian <span class="highlight">women</span> if that is his opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps he thinks that the majority of Australian <span class="highlight">women</span> in that role are fascists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> in Australia, the wives and mothers of our society, face a very difficult situation at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their theory was to arrange the economy so that it would be just about impossible for a family to subsist on one wage and, by doing so, men and <span class="highlight">women</span> would be discouraged from having children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much of the activities of the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s movement was based on an objection to the idea that <span class="highlight">women</span>, by their biological destinies, ought to remain in the home and ought not to pursue careers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That objection was based on the notion that if <span class="highlight">women</span> could obtain satisfaction from careers- and they ought to be able to do that if they have that talent and that talent is not suppressed- <span class="highlight">women</span> should have that equal right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me also that this error is flowing into the thinking of society concerning the role of <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly is not being applied in that context to <span class="highlight">women</span> who are pursuing a specific job- this is, the role of homemaker and the role of child raiser. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fallacy on the part of the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s movement argument is that while is rejects what it calls the sexist assumption that <span class="highlight">women</span>, by reason of their biological makeup, were destined to follow a particular sort of course in their life and that it was unnatural for them to want to do anything like follow another careerand I would agree obviously wholeheartedly with that rejection- I fear that the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s movement has appeared to impose on <span class="highlight">women</span> a different sort of assumption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But very many <span class="highlight">women</span>, I must say to the Senate and specifically to  Senator O  ‘Byrne, who do like the job that they are doing- that is, the traditional job, the biological destiny type job- are now fearful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ought to consider that particular task for which so many <span class="highlight">women</span> do opt, willingly, happily and gladly, and for which they have the necessary talents; we ought to consider that a job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been estimated that the contribution of <span class="highlight">women</span> to the gross national product is approximately 25 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another aspect is the failure to have the time to make the type of household economies which most <span class="highlight">women</span> are not able to make when they take on a full time occupation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">women</span> had a trade union, this situation would not have gone on for so long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fear that has been expressed to me by both <span class="highlight">women</span> in that position and <span class="highlight">women</span> who are acquainted with other <span class="highlight">women</span> in that position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been suggestions that governments ought to pay <span class="highlight">women</span> a wage for staying at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I think governments must find some way of making an equitable recognition of the contribution that <span class="highlight">women</span> do make to their family economy and thereby to the economy of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that at present many Australian <span class="highlight">women</span> are not truly free to choose; they need to go out to full time employment in order to keep their family decently and to educate them to the point which is so necessary in this modern society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister for Social Security whether widows and <span class="highlight">women</span> who receive supporting mothers pensions will receive the 6.4 per cent increase recently announced by the Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Special consideration was also given to the difficulties encountered by <span class="highlight">women</span>, particularly deserted wives and unmarried mothers, who were unskilled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware of voluminous reports which indicate that migrant <span class="highlight">women</span> are often discriminated against and coerced by unscrupulous employers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the Government’s new guidelines for unemployment benefits, will the Minister advise what steps have been taken or are proposed to be taken to prevent the sexploitation of migrant <span class="highlight">women</span> by some employers who can now threaten such persons not only with the loss of employment but also with their being ineligible for unemployment benefits for at least 6 weeks? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular there is no intention to exploit migrant <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matters which have been referred to concerning unscrupulous employers who make undue demands upon migrant <span class="highlight">women</span>, with the threat of dismissal and loss of employment, are matters that concern us all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has come to my notice that this office is refusing to register as unemployed those men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who do not conform to  Mr Carrigan’s  idea of being well dressed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister for Social Security accept that in the community there are many <span class="highlight">women</span> who are bringing up children on their own and who, at the moment, arc struggling to make ends meet on the supporting mother’s benefit? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does she accept that many of these <span class="highlight">women</span> have no current qualifications which would lead to constant employment at a wage which would enable them to bring up their children in a life-style similar to that of the majority of the rest of the community? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister accept that there are many <span class="highlight">women</span> who are not receiving supporting mother’s benefit but whose domestic circumstances are such that they also need qualifications to enable them to earn a living that will cover the responsibilities, which they have taken on, of raising a family? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has been suggested with regard to training programs for supporting mothers or for other <span class="highlight">women</span> who have family responsibilities is also consistent with our attitude towards the personal development of the individual with the opportunity to take part in the mainstream of activity in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year as a delegate to the United Nations conference for International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year I was very privileged and interested to meet many of the <span class="highlight">women</span> who had attended the population control conference in Romania as delegates for their countries in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">women</span> of the Third World became very angry at the kinds of population control programs that were being inflicted on their sisters because those programs were based on Western values and Western technologies and completely ignored the spiritual and cultural values of the <span class="highlight">women</span> who were supposed to fit into those programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was from many tragic experiences where <span class="highlight">women</span> involuntarily were subjected by visiting specialists to forms of birth control that were totally alien to their values of family and child rearing and child bearing that opposition to Western-type population control grew to the extent that there was a massive political rejection of these programs at the Romanian conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think if  Senator Sheil  had considered what was said by <span class="highlight">women</span> delegates at that conference he would be better informed as to why some of the population control programs in the Third World had failed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the view of those <span class="highlight">women</span>, <span class="highlight">women</span> who were intimately involved in what is happening to their sisters in the Third World countries, that if population control is to be successful, it must bc something that the <span class="highlight">women</span> themselves want and understand and which does not destroy their whole fabric of family life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is certainly totally unacceptable to say this to the <span class="highlight">women</span> in villages in India or parts of Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point this out because I think that it was rather incomplete for  Senator Sheil  to talk about the failure of population control programs in the Third World without talking about what seemed to me to be the most morally significant aspect of that failure, namely, that the <span class="highlight">women</span> on whom these programs were inflicted were never consulted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enrolments in this program have now been reduced to, I think, 30, which means that <span class="highlight">women</span> are being deprived not only of employment but also of the opportunity to acquire the skills which could lead to employment in better times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the Senate ask the Government to make such funds available as will enable projects commenced during International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year 1975 to continue and be expanded, and take urgent and immediate steps to eliminate all forms of discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australia, and to actively encourage the elimination of discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span> in all parts of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I rise on this matter because I feel that, as International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year finished about two or three weeks ago, the matter should not be dropped but should be kept before the Government and the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because when International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year was first mooted the government of the day had long recognised that discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span> was incompatible with human dignity and with the wellbeing of society, it saw International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year as a chance to highlight areas to which the community had turned a blind eye for so long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the year 1974 it was thought necessary to give the world 12 months in which to recognise that there had been discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span>, that there was discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span> and that unless steps were taken to bring <span class="highlight">women</span> out of themselves and to realise their full potential, the world was missing out on the potential of over 50 per cent of the population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it was thought necessary to nominate a year to ensure that the basic human rights of <span class="highlight">women</span> were recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year was seen as a year to provide opportunity to stand back and assess what had been achieved and what needed to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many areas nobody had thought it necessary to do anything for <span class="highlight">women</span> in a particular fashion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the projects that were taken up during International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year, of which I think we should not lose sight, have only just begun and should be extended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer for instance to the continued establishment of a network of community centres to respond to <span class="highlight">women</span>’s problems and to encourage their activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People talk a lot about suburban neurosis, about the problems of the nuclear family, about the problems of <span class="highlight">women</span> from other countries who do not speak English and who are isolated in outlying areas of our major cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Up until this point nobody thought that by providing the sheer physical environment, a place where <span class="highlight">women</span> could meet, talk and discuss their problems, we might be going a long way towards curing some of those very real, very nasty and very modern complaints that do so much to tear the fabric of our modern society apart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I was about to say, <span class="highlight">women</span> in country areas sometimes have an even harder row to hoe because at least in some areas of our cities people can occasionally board a tram- when the tram runsand go to communicate with their fellows, with people who speak the same language or with their families, although that is becoming increasingly difficult in the cities which we have created. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> isolated in the country where they have not even a telephone cannot communicate with their fellows. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other areas in which <span class="highlight">women</span> needed the establishment of some sort of community centre were the areas of health, shelter, refuge, counselling and rape. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some very hard things have been said about the sort of <span class="highlight">women</span> who have taken advantage of these centres and the sort of <span class="highlight">women</span> who have set up these centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I suppose that it is a bit hard for men to understand that there are times when <span class="highlight">women</span> want to talk to people who understand exactly what their health problem is- and that is not a man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For very little outlay and upkeep such centres can be established where <span class="highlight">women</span> can go and find out that they are not freaks, that the things that happen to them happen to other <span class="highlight">women</span> and that somebody ought to be taking some notice of the things that happen to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the same token, <span class="highlight">women</span> who because of their domestic difficulties, because of overworkthere will be more of them- have broken down and have found that they cannot stand the pressure of working, keeping a family and looking after a house, need some place where they can go after the first violent reaction so that they can find their way back into the community, talk to their fellows or their peers, talk about ways to manage their lives and ways to manage the seemingly endless problems that come up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in this instance I am very much aware of the fact that there needs to be a place where <span class="highlight">women</span> can go to seek shelter and refuge and some advice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Too often these days I meet <span class="highlight">women</span> who, when I ask them what they do, hang their heads and say, ‘We are only housewives’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was one of the areas that International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year wanted to cover and I think started to cover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another of the areas that we wanted to look into was the effect of the education system on <span class="highlight">women</span>’s self-image. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So many <span class="highlight">women</span> had no confidence in themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It had seen <span class="highlight">women</span> as filling in their time between leaving school and having a baby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The isolation of <span class="highlight">women</span>, on which I have touched, is a very real problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a very real problem in an understandable way for migrant <span class="highlight">women</span> who come to Australia and who do not understand our language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is terrifying for <span class="highlight">women</span> more so because while their husbands go out to work and of necessity must have some contact and learn something of the community they live in, those <span class="highlight">women</span> can be locked up inside 4 walls day in day out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until the International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year conference raised that problem it was not even considered to be a problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For those <span class="highlight">women</span> it is a diabolical problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it can be a problem also for <span class="highlight">women</span> living in outer suburbs and who spend their days in conversation with 3-year-olds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year wanted to cover the participation of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the area of films, television and radio programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We found that in those areas <span class="highlight">women</span> were very good clerks, filing clerks, telephone answerers or letter-typers and they gave a great deal of advice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> are working hard in that area and have a great deal of expertise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But because they are <span class="highlight">women</span> not very much notice is taken of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was written by <span class="highlight">women</span> for <span class="highlight">women</span> and was broadcast by <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am amazed that commercial stations which profess to have such a great concern for <span class="highlight">women</span> and which certainly, day after day, try to sell <span class="highlight">women</span> goods worth hundreds of thousands of dollars cannot take up the challenge and do something along their own lines to provide a program for <span class="highlight">women</span> which is produced by <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For once, they should listen to what <span class="highlight">women</span> want and provide it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year provided an opportunity to stand back and assess what had been achieved up to date in this area and what needed to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the national secretariat for International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year advertised the fact that money could be devoted to various projects coming under the heading of International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year, by 4 December 1974 the costed submissions it received amounted to $3.5m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But they all came from areas concerned for <span class="highlight">women</span>’s rights, for <span class="highlight">women</span>’s lives, for <span class="highlight">women</span> and their children and the sort of lives they had been living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It proved that although until that time other departments and institutions had had some responsibility in that area- they had had it for a long time- they had not done anything about communicating their ability to deal with those problems to <span class="highlight">women</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There had been no communication between those departments and institutions and <span class="highlight">women</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody could say that $2m spent in 12 months for International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year in a big country like Australia, a country as wealthy as Australia, is a lot of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not saying that discrimination does not exist in other areas, but in this instance we will not find out how far discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span> goes unless we give <span class="highlight">women</span> a chance to speak out, to talk about their needs, thoughts, worries, hopes and dreams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That needs more time, and that is why I want this Government to extend some of the funding that went into International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 12 months we got articulate <span class="highlight">women</span> to speak out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 12 months there were <span class="highlight">women</span> to whom the idea of speaking out filtered through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some <span class="highlight">women</span> speaking out, but there are thousands upon thousands of <span class="highlight">women</span> who do not know that they are oppressed, who do not know that life could be better and who do not realise what society is doing to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span> exists in Australia in many different ways and some of the things that we have found out give us an idea of the direction in which we should go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the following few weeks I received letters from individual <span class="highlight">women</span>, groups of <span class="highlight">women</span>, scientists and doctors saying that no research had been done and that up to that point nobody had thought it terribly important that research like this be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One got the distinct feeling that, because it was something that was happening to <span class="highlight">women</span> who, after all, do have babies and always have had babies, and because everybody knows how it happens- although I am not sure that everybody knows how it is brought about- nothing had been done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many <span class="highlight">women</span> around Australia have said for a long time that people do not really know what effect the pill has on some <span class="highlight">women</span>, <span class="highlight">women</span> in certain conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because society now is in some ways dependent on the pill and because so many <span class="highlight">women</span> are pressured into using the pill, one would think that science would investigate very promptly, as it concerns such a large proportion of the community, the effect that the pill has on <span class="highlight">women</span> ‘s systems and the effect that it has on <span class="highlight">women</span> mentally, and would take immediate steps to make sure that <span class="highlight">women</span> were safeguarded against any excesses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year there was a group which tried to get funding in order to spread the news about breast-feeding and about how well babies did and how much better they were for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We sat back very smugly in the last couple of years and said that equal pay had come in and therefore <span class="highlight">women</span> were right in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know of cases where <span class="highlight">women</span> are machinists and mcn are technicians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a basic principle, because in enticing <span class="highlight">women</span> into the work force in many ways we arc getting them out there as cheap labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We accept that cheap labour, that slave labour; but, when those <span class="highlight">women</span> get put off their jobs, do they get unemployment benefit? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I talked about enticing <span class="highlight">women</span> back to the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To make it better, more pleasant and easier for <span class="highlight">women</span> to go back, in government circles we brought in maternity leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps we should think of a new name for it, because I find that in the community there are people who think that <span class="highlight">women</span> who leave work to have babies get 12 months leave on full pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That entitlement has not filtered through to <span class="highlight">women</span> in industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We entice <span class="highlight">women</span> back into industry; but what do we do about retraining them for a proper place in industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that the <span class="highlight">women</span> who feci that they want to come back into the work force should be able to do so under the best possible conditions, but it is even more important that the <span class="highlight">women</span> who have to come back into the work force are able to do so under the best possible conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Government to look at this matter as a matter of great priority: There are <span class="highlight">women</span> being trained under the NEAT scheme who have lived on the supporting mother’s benefit for a long time or who, if they have not lived on the supporting mother’s benefit, have done menial jobs in the community- scrubbed floors, taken in washing and kept house for other people- to provide the sort of income they need to enable them to keep their children as best they can under the same conditions as those enjoyed by the rest of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the same token there are <span class="highlight">women</span> in the community who because of their domestic circumstances- they may have a husband who is an alcoholic and upon whom they can never depend to bring in a regular income but who brings in some income- should be given the chance to achieve those qualifications that will enable them to look after their families in a solid fashion without, as has been suggested to some of them by some government employees, having to leave their husbands and so entitle themselves to the supporting mother’s benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are really talking about <span class="highlight">women</span> coming into the work force and we are not doing more than paying lip service to retraining we ought to look at these things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to quote from a booklet put out by the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Bureau of the Department of Labour entitled ‘How to find the job you want’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One knows that it is directed to <span class="highlight">women</span> because it has a rose on the cover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only men would do that to <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conditions under which <span class="highlight">women</span> in the workforce are employed smack of discrimination to the nth degree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Metropolitan Board of Works in Melbourne has some rather delightful guidelines for the employment of <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Married <span class="highlight">women</span>, as temporary employees, cannot be members of the Board’s superannuation fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Married <span class="highlight">women</span>, as temporary employees, are not eligible for paid study leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that puts paid to any thought that the Board really accepts <span class="highlight">women</span> as a real part of the workforce, as real citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> are at some disadvantage in the area of legal aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This applies especially to <span class="highlight">women</span> who are at home and who have no income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We went to the extent of establishing legal aid offices because we believed that nobody should be at a disadvantage before the law and that everybody, even <span class="highlight">women</span>, should be equal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But somebody has to look at the area of the <span class="highlight">women</span> in the home who have no income and who therefore go along to a legal aid office to get some advice on, say, divorce because of the conduct of their husbands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that the present governments and future governments will have to look at how taxation affects <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As long as husbands and wives are taxed differently, even though in most instances the working wives work twice as hard, there will be many <span class="highlight">women</span> around who feel that they are being discriminated against. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it is the duty of governments to take up those sorts of matters and to come up with some proposals for the relief of what in some ways I think is indiscriminate taxation when it comes to <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that it raises a bit of a giggle among my male colleagues and even my male constituents, but the fact of the matter is that <span class="highlight">women</span> are depicted on radio and television and in the newspapers as happy little twirps who have no mind of their own and as some sort of a vegetable that has a continual smile on its face, that is never allowed to lose its temper, that is never allowed to be a human being and that is never allowed to have hates and loves of its own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Newpapers should treat <span class="highlight">women</span> as adult human beings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not suppose we can legislate to ensure that newspapers present us with the sort of material to read that would broaden our outlook, broaden our minds or give us more information, but at least governments could legislate for <span class="highlight">women</span> to be treated as whole human beings and not as some sort of cardboard cutout that is propped up either to sell soap powder, trucks, carpets or any other thing that happens to be going at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This puts <span class="highlight">women</span> under undue pressure to conform to an image that the media cuts out for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">women</span> do not see themselves depicted in that area as real human beings then I feel they are never going to take themselves seriously as human beings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the motion which is before us we ask that this Government take steps to ensure that discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span> in all parts of the world is brought to an end as quickly as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely we could advise our representative on the United Nations to watch out and to encourage movements in other countries towards cutting down discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Chinese say that <span class="highlight">women</span> hold up half of heaven. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is so it seems to me that <span class="highlight">women</span> are entitled to recognition in their own countries as full, well meaning, well disposed intelligent human beings who can contribute so much to the good of their country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Liberation Movement believes that <span class="highlight">women</span> and men should be equal and that the Government has appointed a <span class="highlight">women</span>’s adviser at a salary of $24,000 a year, following the silly nonsense of the previous Government, will the Government consider appointing a special men’s adviser to the Government on such problems as abandoned husbands in order to spend more of this country’s money and to bring about equality of the sexes, as desired by the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Liberation Movement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that, not having the benefit of a wife, he understands little about <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is fair to say that those of us who are happily married certainly get the right advice on how to look after <span class="highlight">women</span> properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The argument is that couples have deferred the birth of their first child for several years, perhaps in response to economic circumstances or to changed attitudes towards <span class="highlight">women</span> working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned that it is heavily weighted against <span class="highlight">women</span> and, perhaps, only lightly weighted against men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment my prime concern is that <span class="highlight">women</span> are discriminated against whether they stay at home or choose to go to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a taxpayer he may be interested to know that there is discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps this is why there are only 5000 <span class="highlight">women</span> among the 46 000 top money earners in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned that this is perhaps one of the reasons that <span class="highlight">women</span> stay out of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, we have only 6 <span class="highlight">women</span> in this chamber while there are 58 men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My situation is no different from that of any number of <span class="highlight">women</span> who work in the community, whether from economic necessity, because they are concerned that having only a male breadwinner places a strain on the man and could leave them widows in early life, or whether purely and simply they desire to go out to work to fulfil themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">women</span> are not allowed to claim such things as child day care charges or after school care charges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today I was interested to receive in the mail from the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Electoral Lobby a representation relating to probate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assure honourable senators that many men and <span class="highlight">women</span> in the community also await that decision with interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I return to the submission of the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Electoral Lobby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps 1 could refer to what the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Electoral Lobby says in its covering letter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its letter the <span class="highlight">Women</span> ‘s Electoral Lobby says: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are laws there which make it extremely difficult for <span class="highlight">women</span> who suddenly find themselves widowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One other point that I wish to raise tonight concerns <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges which are operating in all States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can speak only about the situation in Western Australia because I have close ties with the Nardine <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuge there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned about the situation where people are caring for <span class="highlight">women</span> who find it necessary, generally in the middle of the night, to leave their matrimonial home, quite often in a distressed state and quite often accompanied by children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Nardine <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuge can accommodate 9 families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Up to the present I think that about 500 <span class="highlight">women</span> and more than 1500 children have been turned away from the refuge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not like to deprive people who require emergency housing of this accommodation, but I can see no reason why <span class="highlight">women</span> who clutter up <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges- quite often they clutter up <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges purely and simply because they have nowhere else to go- could not be housed in this type of accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet there does not seem to be any realisation on the part of the State Housing Commission that these <span class="highlight">women</span> are in drastic need of emergency housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whence, bludger (sometimes a man living on immoral earnings of <span class="highlight">women</span>). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I am speaking on this matter I refer to the matters mentioned by  Senator Coleman  in relation to <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The persons eligible for assistance under this program are men and <span class="highlight">women</span> without a settled home through social factors such as alcoholism, inadequacy, domestic conflict or similar reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is felt that refuges for <span class="highlight">women</span> and children made homeless by domestic conflict are funded under the community health program which is administered by the Hospitals and Health Services Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The arrangement with regard to <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges is being reviewed by the Department of Health and the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable senator knows, the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s health centres and refuges, as we refer to them at the present time, come under the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is any further information which I am able to offer with regard to my program for homeless persons or the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s health centres and refuges I shall obtain it for the honourable senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What evaluation is being made by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee and what recommendations have been made about the use of Diazepam during pregnancy, in view of two clinical reports establishing a possible association between the use of Diazepam in pregnant <span class="highlight">women</span> and the birth of children with cleft lip. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-44-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It considered that care should be exercised when prescribing diazepam for pregnant <span class="highlight">women</span> or those likely to become pregnant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-44-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to reports, which were widespread in the Australian Press earlier this month, of allegations made at a <span class="highlight">women</span>’s conference in Brussels that Aboriginal <span class="highlight">women</span> are being compulsorily sterilised in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am able to inform the Senate that investigations were carried out following the statements that were made with regard to the forced sterilisation of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This resulted in detailed investigations being made by the Northern Territory health authorities into sterilisation procedures involving Aboriginal <span class="highlight">women</span> in Northern Territory hospitals between 1 January 1973 and 31 December 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increasing number of girls qualifying to enter the medical faculty at the University of Sydney has been a great source of distress to some of the more conservative elements in the profession who argue along the lines that it is a waste of time for the Government to invest money in training <span class="highlight">women</span> as doctors because we all know what <span class="highlight">women</span> do: They do not repay it the community - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is said that <span class="highlight">women</span> go off and do unproductive things like having children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the Minister’s attention to the fact that in the past <span class="highlight">women</span> have been extremely severely disadvantaged in obtaining access to technical education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the time has come in our society when <span class="highlight">women</span> are called upon for a number of reasons to support themselves and, as that time has come, it is incumbent upon a responsible government to ensure that technical education is available equally to <span class="highlight">women</span> as it is to men in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have mentioned in this chamber before that the latest census figures available showed that 80 per cent of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force had no skills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures show that, whilst it may be desirable to talk about providing a wider range of choice to enable <span class="highlight">women</span> to remain in the home, the cost of increasing child endowment to the extent suggested would have those economic consequences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a woman, perhaps I should explain that the majority of <span class="highlight">women</span> who I know wear stoles or scarves that would be approximately 5 feet to 6 feet in length. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear that  Senator Sheil  would have us believe that we have the right and the responsibility to tell what he calls Third World countries to control their population growth but that we should not seriously think of doing it in the way that perhaps the <span class="highlight">women</span> who are not only physically and emotionally involved but also financially involved in this area would wish it done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned that  Senator Sheil  obviously does not think that the <span class="highlight">women</span> in those countries have any rights to determine what methods of birth control will be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">women</span> of the Third World became very angry  at the kinds of population control programs that were being inflicted on their sisters because those programs were based on Western values and Western technologies and completely ignored the spiritual and cultural values of the <span class="highlight">women</span> who were supposed to fit into those programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was from many tragic experiences where <span class="highlight">women</span> involuntarily were subjected by visiting specialists to forms of birth control that were totally alien to their values of family and child rearing and child bearing that opposition to Western-type population control grew to the extent that there was a massive political rejection of these programs at the Romanian conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think if  Senator Sheil  had considered what was said by <span class="highlight">women</span> delegates at that conference he would be better informed as to why some of the population control programs in the Third World had failed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the view of those <span class="highlight">women</span>, <span class="highlight">women</span> who were intimately involved in what is happening to their sisters in the Third World countries, that if population control is to be successful, it must be something that the <span class="highlight">women</span> themselves want and understand and which does not destroy their whole fabric of family life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer also to the innovations relating to <span class="highlight">women</span> public servants, particularly the introduction of equality of benefits and the preservation of benefits while the career of a public servant is interrupted for such reasons as the rearing of a family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should have thought that the people who have been so concerned with <span class="highlight">women</span>’s rights and the role of <span class="highlight">women</span> in society, as  Senator Baume  has been, would have remembered the supporting mothers’ benefit which the Labor Government introduced and which for the first time gave mothers a real chance to choose between staying at home and looking after their children or parking them somewhere and going out to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In talking about paying some extra money to <span class="highlight">women</span>, let us look at the sorts of things that governments should be doing to support <span class="highlight">women</span> who are contributing so much to our society by being mothers and home makers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Poor <span class="highlight">women</span> have always needed the money badly and have always spent it and will continue to spend it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> who are better off have always put the money away for their children and they will continue to do the same thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Bonner  has said that we will be giving <span class="highlight">women</span> money that they can spend as they see fit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does he not know how the <span class="highlight">women</span> who need child endowment deal with it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> who need the money will have to spend it as they have always spent it-on paying the milk bills and the grocer’s bills and buying children’s shoes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What has the Government really done for <span class="highlight">women</span> in need? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has not played God and it has not brought a new liberty to <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill does not give recognition to <span class="highlight">women</span> as homemakers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What do these <span class="highlight">women</span> go out and spend money on? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I felt at the time that it was the only method open to the Government to give <span class="highlight">women</span> the real choice they have been seeking for so long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some radical liberationists preach that the freedom of <span class="highlight">women</span> is the eradication of family responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a <span class="highlight">women</span>’s centre in Hobart the words ‘A Family is Woman’s Bondage’ depict this attitude better than I can describe it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> are assured that their brains will stagnate and that they are real no-hopers if they stay at home and bring up their families in the time-honoured tradition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Past governments have joined these pressure groups, and again <span class="highlight">women</span> were told what fools they were if they did not work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recently I attended a seminar in Hobart relating to <span class="highlight">women</span> in the unions which was conducted by the trade union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many <span class="highlight">women</span> present claimed that, given a real choice, they would much prefer to stay at home with their children but that up to date a real choice had not existed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 6 May 1976  (Hansard  page 1618)  Senator Ryan  asked me, as Minister representing the Prime Minister, a question without notice concerning the tabling and publishing of the Report of the Australian National Advisory Committee for International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Report of the Australian National Advisory Committee for International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year was tabled in the House of Representatives on 25 May 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the chamber recognise that the Bill will make certain improvements in the financial situation of some very poor <span class="highlight">women</span> and some very poor families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no question of the provisions of this Bill providing independence for <span class="highlight">women</span>, as some speakers on the Government side have claimed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, by its very nature child endowment will benefit only <span class="highlight">women</span> who are dependent on their husband’s income or on a government benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not criticising this measure but I am criticising the claim that this improvement in the child endowment payment, by itself, constitutes some sort of independence for <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Poor <span class="highlight">women</span>, particularly poor <span class="highlight">women</span> with large families, are still oppressed and powerless in this society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there has been something of a misdirected moralism from some speakers on the Government side of the chamber which has appealed to the prejudice of some sections of the community towards the belief that somehow being a poor mother is a better position to be in than any other position a <span class="highlight">women</span> can be in in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I bring this matter up in this debate because this kind of division of <span class="highlight">women</span> into the deserving poor mothers and the other kinds of <span class="highlight">women</span> who have jobs or who think they may like to train or study to get jobs is very mischievous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It causes hostility between different groups of <span class="highlight">women</span> who should be supporting each other because, after all, they do have common objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation in Australian society today- it has been the situation for a long time- is that all <span class="highlight">women</span> work at some stage of their lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are very few <span class="highlight">women</span> now who do not work at some stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So working is an experience which virtually all <span class="highlight">women</span> in our society have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is very mischievous for some spokesmen and spokeswomen for the conservative elements in our community to talk as though there were some contradiction between working <span class="highlight">women</span> and <span class="highlight">women</span> who say at home- as though there were some serious conflict of interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as most working <span class="highlight">women</span> have children and are therefore aware of the needs of families, particularly poor families, and are happy to support an increase in child endowment, so I think we should encourage <span class="highlight">women</span> who are at present at home with their children to think in terms of supporting policies for <span class="highlight">women</span> who need or wish to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no point in setting <span class="highlight">women</span> in different life styles up against each other for the purpose of appealing to certain prejudices in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extent of discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force is still very great. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Government in making this admirable small measure towards helping the position of poor <span class="highlight">women</span> at home will not feel that it has done enough for <span class="highlight">women</span> and will not ignore the extent of discrimination which is still suffered by <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On pages 6 and 7 of this report there is evidence to show that discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force on the basis of sex is still extremely widespread and extremely disadvantageous to those <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not read the findings of this Committee but I recommend the report, particularly to those members of the Government who may be tempted to feel that the Government has done enough for <span class="highlight">women</span> by increasing the child endowment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to talk about giving independence and real choice to <span class="highlight">women</span>, there is much more a responsible government needs to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government, which was a responsible government, started to do many things in the areas of improving educational opportunities for <span class="highlight">women</span>, in providing training opportunities for <span class="highlight">women</span> so that when they went into the work force they could take skilled and rewarding employment, and in such things as removing tertiary fees which allowed <span class="highlight">women</span> who had never had the opportunity to undertake tertiary studies to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the most important thing done by the Labor Government in relation to giving <span class="highlight">women</span> real choice and independence was the formulation of a national child care program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was quite amazed last night to hear  Senator Baume,  speaking for the Government, claim that this Bill, which increases child endowment payments, represented some sort of radical program for a genuine redistribution of wealth throughout the community, that it was innovative and that nothing like this had ever been done for <span class="highlight">women</span> or families before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that programs started under the Labor Government, such as the National Employment and Training scheme which for the first time gave <span class="highlight">women</span> and men an opportunity to train for employment on an allowance comparable to average weekly earnings, were a much more radical step. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the removal of discrimination within the Public Service gave more opportunities to <span class="highlight">women</span>, as did the introduction of maternity leave and, to a lesser extent, paternity leave for government employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other claim that has been made during the course of this debate is that <span class="highlight">women</span> now will have a choice to stay at home and not work and that this is a choice which most <span class="highlight">women</span> want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also found  Senator Baume  ‘s suggestion that this Bill recognised the productivity of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the home to be rather insulting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I return to the question of choice for <span class="highlight">women</span> to enter the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that we in the Australian Labor Party have always considered it desirable that <span class="highlight">women</span> have a genuine choice as to whether they go to work or stay at home; but we recognised that for many <span class="highlight">women</span> there was no such choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of these, like the National Employment and Training scheme, have been wound down almost to a standstill by the present Government, thus actually reducing the genuine choice available to <span class="highlight">women</span> in this circumstance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She said that the high proportion of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force in the last couple of years came about somehow as the result of a Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gives some indication of the fact that the participation of married <span class="highlight">women</span> and mothers in the work force has been increasing steadily since 1947. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in 1 947 the proportion of all working <span class="highlight">women</span> who were married was 15.3 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, the proportion of all married <span class="highlight">women</span> who were in paid employment in 1947 was 6.5 per cent; in 1 97 1 , again still during the period of a Liberal-National Country Party Government, it was 32.8 per cent; and in 1974 it was 40.5 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that my reference to those figures will prevent from being made yet again in the Senate the claim that somehow the high participation of mothers and married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force was a phenomenon that came about only as a result of the Labor Government and somehow as a result of pressures put on families by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was these sorts of pressures that caused <span class="highlight">women</span> to go out to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other sorts of pressures that caused <span class="highlight">women</span> to go out to work in the 1 950s and particularly in the 1960s included the fact that Federal funding of education was so low that <span class="highlight">women</span> felt they had to go to work to be able to improve the educational opportunities of their children by sending them to private schools, which they considered at that time to be better, or by supplementing their children’s educational resources through the purchase of books, extra lessons, tutoring and things of that kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that, if we really want to understand why married <span class="highlight">women</span> went into the work force in such large numbers during that period, we can gain enlightenment on the subject from the sorts of policies pursued by the Liberal-National Country Party Government during that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is totally inaccurate to try to look at such a complex social change as the change in life style of married <span class="highlight">women</span> and families in terms of anything that might have happened during the  5  years of the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are certainly many more steps that this Government can take if it is at all interested in improving opportunities for <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to my first reason for speaking, I agree with  Senator Ryan  that part of the reason why <span class="highlight">women</span> were forced into the work force was the development of consumerism and materialism to the extent that there were socially created wants instead of needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These forced <span class="highlight">women</span> out into the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That factor was the combination of forces resulting from employers and the Department of Labour and National Service seeking to attract <span class="highlight">women</span> into the labour force as a source of cheap labour prior to the introduction of equal pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The trade union movement was conscious of the fact that if the employers and the Department of Labour and National Service were allowed to get away with their campaign to attract a large number of <span class="highlight">women</span> into the work force as a source of cheap labour, obviously that would have a most disastrous effect on employment opportunities and wage standards of breadwinners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, and most importantly, the trade union movement sought to achieve equality- that is, equal pay for work of equal value- for <span class="highlight">women</span> as of right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We did have a large number of complaints whilst I was a member of that Committee from <span class="highlight">women</span> because they were discriminated against in their employment and occupation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To emphasise the point that I made on a previous occasion that many <span class="highlight">women</span> at home are discriminated against in their occupation, I wish to quote from a letter that was written to the Tasmanian Committee on Discrimination in Employment and Occupation by a  Mrs H.  M. Speden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course I love my family; but the idea that <span class="highlight">women</span> produce children purely for their own pleasure is a fallacy sponsored by an affluent and short-sighted society intent on genocide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wonder whether members of this Senate are aware of the actual number of <span class="highlight">women</span> who leave their homes for a number of reasons in the middle of the night with an armful of children or a bunch of toddlers at their side, with generally the clothes they stand up in and nothing more because they do not have the means to carry anything more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addressing itself to the provision of educational facilities and services it will examine amongst other things the overall pattern of institutions and courses including their objectives, the magnitude of the provision including the desirable balance between sectors, the relationship of educational provision to community and individual needs and preferences and the accessibility of education and training including reentry and transferability and the problems of special groups such as the handicapped, ethnic groups, Aboriginals and <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Has the attention of the Minister for Social Security been drawn to the statement by the Minister for Welfare in Tasmania that the Federal Government has avoided all its responsibilities in respect of the <span class="highlight">women</span> ‘s shelter in that State? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760921_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is this not a distortion of the facts, as the Government already has allocated $2.5m to the State for community health services and <span class="highlight">women</span>’s shelters come within that category? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760921_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will show tonight that there is a direct correlation between the increase in the number of married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force since the early 1960s and the increase in juvenile unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A recent survey showed that the majority of married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force- almost 80 per cent- are there for economic reasons, either of socially created want or of need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A number of <span class="highlight">women</span> are forced into the work force through economic reasons or economic pressures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this economy now we enjoy a rate of pay equal to the highest in the world- a higher proportion of <span class="highlight">women</span> is working, there is a high standard of minimum pay rates and there is equal pay for <span class="highlight">women</span> and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have to consider the substantial proportion of the work force that now comprises working <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These <span class="highlight">women</span> do this by individual choice and they take the individual consequences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Tasmania as well a lot of <span class="highlight">women</span> have been in employment for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such questions involve issues such as the generation gap, <span class="highlight">women</span>’s liberation and censorship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761007_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question to the Minister representing the Minister for Health relates to the continuing unacceptably high loss of trained <span class="highlight">women</span> graduates and diplomates from the health professions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761007_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Minister that only 50 per cent of nurses are in practice 5 years after graduation while similar drop-out rates apply to other <span class="highlight">women</span> health professionals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761007_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware of the scheme started in New South Wales by the former Liberal Government to offer flexible working hours for up to 20 <span class="highlight">women</span> medical graduates to be retained in practice on a part-time basis? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761007_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since this arrangement is a start towards better retention schemes for <span class="highlight">women</span> and is consonant with views expressed by the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Electoral Lobby and other <span class="highlight">women</span>’s groups, I ask whether in the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern territory there are any similar schemes in the helping professions such as medicine, nursing, social work or physiotherapy offering flexible part-time employment to the pool of trained <span class="highlight">women</span> whose skills at present are lost to society? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761007_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw to the Minister’s attention the fact that during the reign of a Labor government the application of the old war service homes legislation was extended to further categories of ex-servicemen and <span class="highlight">women</span>, at a higher interest rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I reject and my Party rejects completely and unequivocally the proposition that the spending of money on improving a road, providing a library service, or opening up a new beach, a <span class="highlight">women</span> ‘s rest centre or a baby health centre is the reason why we have inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Readers of the  National Times  were served up by  Mr Bond,  by W. D.

  <li>
    <p>In reply to a question by  Senator Grimes  the Minister stated quite clearly that the Federal Government, the Fraser Government, has abrogated to the States the responsibility for the funding of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In reply to the point of order, I point out that the information on the funding of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges about which I wish to speak this evening is available from sources other than the Estimates Committee debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will mean a decrease in the resources available to <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will mean in some cases the closure of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed 2 <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges in Queensland have already been closed as a result of the Federal Government’s decision to cease funding and to hand its responsibility to the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In practical terms this means that many <span class="highlight">women</span> and children who would have been able to seek assistance from refuges will not have that source of assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise this matter tonight to draw attention to the difficulties faced by these <span class="highlight">women</span> and children, in the hope that the Government may reconsider its policy and may give consideration to continued assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to make a few remarks on the background of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were begun by <span class="highlight">women</span> who were committed to assisting other <span class="highlight">women</span> experiencing the trauma of domestic violence or some other domestic crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that the self help concept so admirably demonstrated in the operation of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges would have recommended itself to those who profess a Liberal philosophy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many cases they provide short term assistance which enables <span class="highlight">women</span> and their families to continue a normal existence afterwards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are often the stepping stone for <span class="highlight">women</span> towards economic independence or a more peaceful arrangement with their husbands whom they have had to leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit to the Senate that the provision of normal welfare type services, normal welfare type housing for families in distress, homes for children and so on is a much more expensive operation than the subsidisation of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges for a few thousand dollars a year to enable them to provide the sort of assistance that they do provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to cite figures prepared by the National <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Refuge Co-operative, which show that 23 refuges are operating in Australia, although the 2 refuges in Queensland have been closed down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In their period of operation the refuges have assisted 1 1 985 <span class="highlight">women</span> and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or has the Federal Government abandoned the refuges because of lack of concern by it about the particular kinds of distressed <span class="highlight">women</span> and children who find themselves in refuges? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is certainly true that many of the <span class="highlight">women</span> in the refuges are poor, they are unskilled, they are in poor physical and mental health, and they are without alternative resources to cope with the crisis which faces them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit to the Senate that there are probably no more needy persons than some of those who find themselves in <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have been told by spokeswoman from the refuges, who I might point out have now made two fairly fruitless and expensive trips to Canberra to seek assistance, that the Minister has discussed the possibility of introducing some time in the future a Bill for the funding of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges on a national basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not a great number of <span class="highlight">women</span> are suited to this kind of work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Volunteers often find themselves unable to maintain their assistance to refuges in this way because of the excessively depressing and unhappy aspect of the work involved in running <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span>’s refuges have no organised fundraising bodies to assist them, as yet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Minister must know that many refuges currently giving vital assistance to thousands of <span class="highlight">women</span> and children throughout Australia will close down in the next few months if they do not receive assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The refuges were an initiative by <span class="highlight">women</span> to help other <span class="highlight">women</span>, and that initiative gained the support of the Whitlam Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Fraser Government has inherited the responsibility of the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges and should accept the responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Arguing federalism will not save the refuges and will not help the thousands of <span class="highlight">women</span> and children who need this help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In attempt to break the revolution, numbers of Hungarians, including some <span class="highlight">women</span>, were deported to the Soviet Union and some may not have been returned to their homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not delay the Senate long to respond to  Senator Ryan,  who raised the matter of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She fairly asked: What has been the Government’s policy with regard to the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s shelters and the community health program being handed to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree that in Queensland, despite the fact that bulk grants were forwarded to that State, <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges have not been funded by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had discussions with a deputation of members representing <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also fair tq say that the Prime Minister and I and other Ministers met representatives of a very wide cross section of <span class="highlight">women</span> ‘s groups recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister expressed his hope that a national advisory committee on <span class="highlight">women</span>’s matters would be formed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He hoped that that Committee would be instrumental in putting forward programs and matters that are of concern and of interest to <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall bring these matters which have been raised this evening with regard to <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges under the community health program to the attention of the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At page 12 of this publication figures indicate that there are 285 000 <span class="highlight">women</span> with children 14 years of age or under who would like to work if proper child care arrangements were available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister consider that the reduced allocation of funds for child care in the recent Lynch Budget and the reduced resources for planning and administration following the abolition of the Children’s Commission, will enable the mounting of a child care program adequate to meet the needs of the children of these 285 000 <span class="highlight">women</span> who wish to exercise their choice of undertaking paid employment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matters raised by the honourable senator with regard to the number of <span class="highlight">women</span> with children who would like to enter the Australian work force are known to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to say one other thing about the 285 000 <span class="highlight">women</span> who may wish to enter the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see another problem as being a very real one, that is, the lack of employment opportunities for <span class="highlight">women</span> and others in the Australian community at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been drawn to our attention that in some States child care facilities are not fully utilised at present- this would be so in some areas outside metropolitan citiesbecause of the lack of availability of suitable employment for <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this is another matter of concern to all of us who wish to see that <span class="highlight">women</span> are able to exercise their own choice in the way in which they determine their own lives consistent with their family responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We live in a world striving to find ways for men and <span class="highlight">women</span> to improve their standards of life and, at the very least, to achieve one of the fundamental freedoms- freedom from want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would cause more hardship as the <span class="highlight">women</span> workforce are unable to get alternate employment in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I noticed quite a few vehicles inside the police station yard and various men and <span class="highlight">women</span> also there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Usually <span class="highlight">women</span> have their babies on the Island, but  Mrs James  had to come to Townsville Hospital as they were going to perform some operation on her to stop her having more children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am referring, of course, to unemployed <span class="highlight">women</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are <span class="highlight">women</span> in Melbourne who will never have families because they cannot afford to stop working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">women</span> are not paid unemployment benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have a husband who goes to work and if he loses his job he is the person who should go on the unemployment statistics, but they, as <span class="highlight">women</span>, just go out to work to provide this extra money and are not to be counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I query the unemployment figures because I truly believe that many <span class="highlight">women</span> in the community are really unemployed but are not registered and, therefore, are not counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What will happen to the lives and to the economic fabric of this community if those <span class="highlight">women</span> lose their jobs and there is no unemployment benefit for them is something that I think the Government has a duty to look at. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As it is, those <span class="highlight">women</span> tend to turn up on the doorsteps of local doctors asking for drugs such as valium so that they can stop thinking about the terrible situation in which they find themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Real concern should be shown for these <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the same token, real concern should be shown by this Government for <span class="highlight">women</span> who need rape crisis centres, <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges and <span class="highlight">women</span>’s health centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Government knows quite well that <span class="highlight">women</span> need to have rape crisis centres and that the situation as regards <span class="highlight">women</span>, the law and rape in our community is serious. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the Government knows that <span class="highlight">women</span> for all sorts of reasons find they have to leave home in the middle of the night, with or without their children, with or without their goods, and have to find somewhere to go, someone to talk to and some time to assess the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that members of the Government know that <span class="highlight">women</span> have to do that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe they know that in many ways the medical profession in Australia has failed <span class="highlight">women</span> and that the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s health centres are trying to grow up as a result of that failure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many votes can be gained from around <span class="highlight">women</span>’s centres, <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges or rape crisis centres? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Little research is being done into <span class="highlight">women</span>’s troubles, into the effects of the pill, into illnesses that are peculiar to <span class="highlight">women</span>, and little research has been done into the fact that births are now taking place in office hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s excuse at the moment for not doing anything from a Federal point of view about rape crisis centres, <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges and <span class="highlight">women</span>’s health centres is that these matters have been handed over to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we were in government we certainly made money available- for instance, to Victoria for a <span class="highlight">Women</span> Against Rape centre and for a <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Health Collective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Women</span> Against Rape Centre had money made available to it in June 1974, but not one penny of that money has been seen yet because the Victorian Government stands between that money and the people who need it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Health Collective in Victoria was advised in May 1975 that money had been made available to it, but not one penny of that money has reached the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Health Collective to this date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Health Collective does not have any money and the last request it received from the Department was that it should inform the Department on what it would spend its money in 1975-76, yet it has not received one penny of the money that was made available for 1974-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Victorian Government is on record as having appointed a <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, it appointed a <span class="highlight">women</span>’s adviser and then took every step to tie her hands, to ignore her and to show that the appointment was really window dressing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Victorian Government in fact pointed out to the more conservative groups of <span class="highlight">women</span> in Victoria that in fact the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s adviser had no power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No substantial change has occurred in the Victorian Government’s feelings towards <span class="highlight">women</span> or to what should be done ibr <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Victorian Government supporters have accepted without a murmur cuts in welfare housing that effect all those groups of <span class="highlight">women</span> who are vulnerable and cannot assist themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This shows that they do not give a damn about <span class="highlight">women</span> who hold positions and need care for their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They had done very little about family planning before and are not, under the influence of groups such as the Womens Action Alliance, likely to do anything about family planning in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Melzer  stuck mainly to unemployment, <span class="highlight">women</span>’s shelters and <span class="highlight">women</span>’s groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Melzer also referred to <span class="highlight">women</span>’s shelters in the various States being left alone by our Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The money that we have given our State Labor Government has been handed over to the shelters, except to the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s centre in Hobart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In some States up to 70 per cent- in some cases higher in the case of <span class="highlight">women</span> prisoners- of prisoners are Aboriginal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 25 August 1976  (Hansard,  page 279)  Senator Missen  asked the Minister representing the Prime Minister a question  without notice concerning the proposed <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Advisory Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-65-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Acting Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Affairs has now supplied the following information for answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-65-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concept of an advisory body relating to <span class="highlight">women</span> was foreshadowed in the Government’s policy statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-65-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At consultations between Government Ministers, Members, representative non-government organisations and officials held on 7, 8 and 9 September 1976 it was generally agreed that a working party be established to formulate proposals for such a body, and that reports of the working party would have wide circulation among <span class="highlight">women</span> and <span class="highlight">women</span>’s organisations to allow for the broadest possible consultation and comment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-65-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the major problems faced in repatriation hospitals is the high proportion of <span class="highlight">women</span> who are employed in them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I am grateful to have from  Senator Melzer  an account of the work of the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre, which is of great interest to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meetings that took place with the Acting Prime Minister at the time, Jim Cairns, and with  Mr Snedden,  it was agreed that the pressure on Darwin should be relieved by evacuation of the <span class="highlight">women</span> and children, the infirm and the ill. To Major-General Stretton ‘s credit, he entered into that exercise with great enthusiasm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the guidelines were set down that only <span class="highlight">women</span>, children and the infirm were to be evacuated and that Darwin was not to be stripped of its work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the third day all the <span class="highlight">women</span> and children who wished to leave - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All my time had been spent at the airport and the instructions were that only <span class="highlight">women</span> and children should be evacuated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But one does not deal with that sort of thing by ‘<span class="highlight">women</span>’s weapons, water-drops’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He then goes on to say that the commissioners, who will be nine in number, will be representative of each of the 6 States and at least two of the nine will be <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other extraordinary thing is this nice token gesture of having 2 <span class="highlight">women</span> on the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could have 6 <span class="highlight">women</span> on the Australian Broadcasting Commission now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those of my colleagues who are more expert in these matters than I am would be able to tell the Senate that that form of tokenism is regarded as reprehensible in some circles where it is believed that the same result can be achieved without written positive discrimination in favour of <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Carrick  represents the Prime Minister in Federal Affairs and I think  Senator Durack  represents the Prime Minister on <span class="highlight">Women</span> ‘s Affairs via  Mr Macphee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were many alarming and contradictory intentions revealed in that statement, but there is one particularly confusing aspect on which I seek clarification, that is, the intention to legislate for 2 <span class="highlight">women</span> commissioners on the Australian Broadcasting Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister agree that the present provision for one woman on the Commission is outdated and discriminatory and does not reflect current attitudes to <span class="highlight">women</span> in positions of influence? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister agree that to provide for only 2 <span class="highlight">women</span> on the Commission would be just as discriminatory in that it would suggest that without such a provision, ungenerous as it is, no <span class="highlight">women</span> at all would be appointed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would not such a provision be treated as an upper limit and thus prevent more than 2 able <span class="highlight">women</span> being appointed to the Commission; or is the provision merely a strategy to enable the Government to sack the staff representative, Marius Webb, and replace him with a partisan female appointment, while making a transparently token gesture towards equality of the sexes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Government’s attitude is quite clearly that there should be equality of opportunity for <span class="highlight">women</span> in all aspects of society, and it will direct itself to that end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result is that many people are injured, <span class="highlight">women</span> are bashed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cases of <span class="highlight">women</span> who go into <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges, for example, are usually complicated by the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s inability to get rental housing at a rate they can afford to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I understand the position, the group comprises the captain and 3 crew members, 14 men, 13 <span class="highlight">women</span>, and 19 children aged between 5 and 17 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs who is also the Minister assisting the Prime Minister in <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the report in the  Australian  of 15 November 1976 which alleges that <span class="highlight">women</span> are being discriminated against in their dealings with banks, especially by the imposition of discriminatory interest rates on loans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because this is the only apprenticeship school in Victoria for hairdressing that gives <span class="highlight">women</span> any sort of go there is obviously no hope at all for it in respect of funding for technical and further education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In November 1974 <span class="highlight">women</span> comprised one-third of the workforce in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators would not be surprised to know that although <span class="highlight">women</span> comprise one-third of the workforce they are at its lowest level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With more direct funding from the federal body <span class="highlight">women</span> could be encouraged to take up many positive careers in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> could play a very important role in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another area in which <span class="highlight">women</span> could play a vital role is in the area of community health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many of the rural areas no doctors are available to assist people but there are many devoted <span class="highlight">women</span> who have a great deal of knowledge and who, with a little more assistance and broadening of that knowledge, could really carry rural health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government needs to inject money into the technical and further education area to make sure that crash courses are made available and to make sure that <span class="highlight">women</span> undertake courses and go out into the community and become part of the workforce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless specific funds are made available <span class="highlight">women</span> and girls in our community will not be able to take their places as skilled people and courses will not be expanded to include them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Victorian Department of Education has given no indication that it even knows that these <span class="highlight">women</span> and girls exist or that they should do anything for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While grants of this amount are made in this way to States like Victoria there is no way that the motor mechanics of the future will love or create painting, there is no way that the plumbers of the future will love or create music, and there is no way that the <span class="highlight">women</span> of Victoria will ever be anything else but the base factory process workers which they are at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think parents will agree that it is much better to have the young men and <span class="highlight">women</span> stay at home than go interstate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As many honourable senators would know, there are some ethnic groups in which the <span class="highlight">women</span> of the family are not allowed to go out to classes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs aware of allegations made by  Ms Elizabeth  Reid, a former adviser to the Labor Prime Minister, that the Minister for Foreign Affairs,  Mr Peacock,  has blocked her application for a senior position in the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s section of the United Nations Centre for Social Development and Humanitarian Affairs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by saying that the number of Australian nationals in the secretariat presently exceeds our quota, but I add that the percentage of Australian <span class="highlight">women</span> is well above the total percentage of <span class="highlight">women</span> employed in the secretariat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of the 4 Australian applicants appointed in 1 975-76, two were <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have a feeling of uncertainty whether the 7 wise men or <span class="highlight">women</span> will be able to radiate out far enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to widen the eligibility of former <span class="highlight">women</span> members of the Royal Australian Air Force for benefits under the Royal Australian Air Force Veteran’s Residences Act 1953. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, they exclude ex-members of the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Auxiliary Australian Air Force raised during World War II, who were not liable for service outside Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A similar condition on exservicewomen was removed from the then War Service Homes Act in 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments proposed by the Bill will mean that all former members of the RAAF and of its <span class="highlight">women</span>’s services will be equally eligible for the provision of residences under the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I address a question to the Minister representing the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could the Minister advise whether this is evidence of the Government’s commitment to the dignity of <span class="highlight">women</span> as human beings or is it still content to sell us as some sort of commodity? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that on so many occasions estate duty has created hardship for surviving spouses, particularly <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The arguments that have been advanced on this issue by the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Electoral Lobby, amongst other organisations, I have found to be sound and convincing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To put men and <span class="highlight">women</span> back to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, as my colleague the shadow Minister for Primary Industry said, it is a crying shame that in a nation where <span class="highlight">women</span> and children in the industrial areas in the cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth cannot afford to buy fruit the only solution that can be found to try to improve the lot of the canned fruit industry is the scheme brought in by the McMahon Government to pull trees out so that fruit would be dearer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gietzelt pointed out, it is a shame that we have to make money available to producers to wreck an industry, to curtail production, when there are so many <span class="highlight">women</span> and children and elderly people in this community who could well do with that fruit if the Government could see its way clear to help that fruit to be placed on the market at a cheaper price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are they not men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who understand and comprehend, or will they always resort to petty party political jibes to try to fool all the people all the time? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the second time today that I have had to rise to express my concern on behalf of the <span class="highlight">women</span> in the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I presume that the word ‘those’ includes exservicewomen, because at the moment there is no provision in most of the previous Acts, including the War Service Homes Act, for a great number of ex-servicewomen who were in the Services during the war but who did not serve overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not their fault that they did not serve overseas, because only <span class="highlight">women</span> who had specific skills were able to serve overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, members of those Forces raised for active service abroad, the AIF, the RAAF and the RAN, some members of the Nursing Service and persons enlisted for service in the Australian Army Medical <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Service (AIF), are eligible for benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, persons who were enlisted in the Citizen Military Force, the Australian Army Medical <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Service (CMF) and the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Auxiliary Forces, which were raised primarily for home service, are not eligible unless they actually served outside Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is, therefore, no distinction, in this regard, between men and <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my mind, there is a very great distinction between the men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who can be covered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No government has yet had the guts to concede that <span class="highlight">women</span> played a vital part in the Services during the war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ex-servicewomen enlisted voluntarily for service but, as I mentioned, they could not, even if they wanted to, enlist for service overseas unless they were skilled in particular areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They could not do so simply because they were <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the attitude of  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack to <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The work that those <span class="highlight">women</span> performed freed a lot of men and enabled them to go overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those men are eligible for housing benefits and the <span class="highlight">women</span> who replaced them are not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">women</span> worked hard and they worked long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want the Government to explain to me why it does not have the guts in this day and age, when it is abolishing the Australian Housing Corporation and replacing it with the Defence Service Homes Corporation, to cater for those <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we are now talking about <span class="highlight">women</span> as well as men who have served in the defence forces in peacetime as being eligible for a benefit which is not available to <span class="highlight">women</span> who served in wartime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the <span class="highlight">women</span> about whom I am talking; they are the ones for whom I am seeking the benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, I am given to understand, consideration was given to extending the scheme to cover those <span class="highlight">women</span>, but it was considered that the cost would be too high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we talking about thousands of <span class="highlight">women</span> who will suddenly apply for this benefit, or are we talking about a few hundred <span class="highlight">women</span> who are at an age- the war finished 30-odd years ago- at which they need security and the advantage of knowing that they have decent, comfortable accommodation for which they can afford to pay and which will be provided for them in their old age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps a few hundred <span class="highlight">women</span> find themselves in those circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The lending institutions and the banks look rather unkindly upon <span class="highlight">women</span>, especially if they happen to be single <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not see that <span class="highlight">women</span> contribute a great deal to the running of Australia, any more than  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack recognises that <span class="highlight">women</span> in the Parliament play a great role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">women</span> have the same difficulties as men in saving for a reasonable deposit on a home in an endeavour to keep monthly repayments at a minimum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am talking about <span class="highlight">women</span> who are no longer young. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am talking about <span class="highlight">women</span> who are now in their fifties and who may find that it is not possible to commit themselves for a great amount of money at widely varying monthly repayments which they may not be able to afford. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I spoke a little earlier about the qualifying period which now applies for ex-service <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> who have served continuously for 3 years in the defence Services can at this point in time have a loan made available to them if they are married or are about to marry or have dependants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been informed that a number of single ex-service <span class="highlight">women</span> have applied for and received loans and have their dependent parents living with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Single ex-servicemen get loans for homes and nobody begrudges the widows of ex-servicemen the benefits that they receive; but I am talking about the <span class="highlight">women</span>, particularly those <span class="highlight">women</span> who were quite prepared to sacrifice themselves if necessary, who sacrified their time and their human resources in wartime service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The excuse that the claims of these <span class="highlight">women</span> could not be considered unless the claims of the men who served in the Citizen Military Forces could be considered is, to my mind, quite spurious. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I wish to make the simple point that the <span class="highlight">women</span> to whom I am referring volunteered; the men of the CMF were conscripted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">women</span> voluntarily enlisted out of a desire to serve their country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I say, for the benefit of  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack, that in 1944 <span class="highlight">women</span> comprised two-thirds of the defence forces serving in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Men could not have gone overseas unless the <span class="highlight">women</span> were prepared to step in and do the messy work that the men had left behind here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this point of time, those <span class="highlight">women</span> want an assurance of proper, permanent, decent accommodation for the rest of their lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Defence Service Homes Corporation will bring before this Parliament in the very near future a Bill for an allocation of land so that a housing project, a block of units perhaps, could be established for the aged amongst those exservice <span class="highlight">women</span> and, if necessary, for their husbands who may not necessarily have contributed in the war effort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have already stated, I do not believe that the extension of this scheme to wartime exservice <span class="highlight">women</span> would commit this Government or any other government to a great deal of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think we should be endeavouring to put a cost on the services of those <span class="highlight">women</span> between 1939 and 1945. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Coleman raised a matter concerning discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span> in relation to the defence service homes scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that there is no question of discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span> because the defence service homes scheme always has been confined to persons who have served on active service outside Australia or on a ship at war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That applies to both men and  <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, there is no discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no discrimination between men and <span class="highlight">women</span> as far as service in Australia is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no firm evidence to my knowledge that <span class="highlight">women</span> using these hair dyes are exposed to any danger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the intervening 30 years, despite the warnings and the tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, men, and to avoid being a chauvinist I would say <span class="highlight">women</span> also, do not seem to have learnt much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The commissioners imply that they should not be considered decision makers, that the Parliament should not be considered as the decision maker, but the ordinary man and <span class="highlight">women</span> in the street should be considered the decision makers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I urge the publication of this material on 2 grounds; firstly and most importantly, to protect the health and well being of our young men and <span class="highlight">women</span> and, secondly, to ensure that at least the Australian athlete will be able to exhibit all the high ideals of true amateurism and not be tempted to succumb to this outright cheating by the use of drugs to attain tainted international honours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition there is recognition of the considerable interest which is being taken in the improvement of programs for children as well as those of more specific interest to <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Considerably increased attention is also being given to the social consequences of broadcasting, and it has therefore been decided to increase the minimum number of <span class="highlight">women</span> on the Commission to at least two. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has also seen fit to state that there will be a minimum of 2 <span class="highlight">women</span> on the Commission and to enlarge the Commission from 9 to 1 1 Commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Oh, yes, we will have 2 <span class="highlight">women</span> on the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously <span class="highlight">women</span> must be concerned about children, so we have a prerequisite for 2 <span class="highlight">women</span>, God help this Government if 10 <span class="highlight">women</span> turn up who are eligible for appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say that not all <span class="highlight">women</span> feel all that much concern for children, and even fathers have some concern for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When these stations applied for their licences they were very pious about what they were going to do for the people of Australia in regard to television, what they were going to do for the performers, musicians, actors and writers, and even occasionally for the children and <span class="highlight">women</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Films that would be called <span class="highlight">women</span>’s programs or would be shown at times when <span class="highlight">women</span> would watch television comprised 5 hours of viewing time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am tempted to comment again on the two <span class="highlight">women</span> who may be members of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I say in passing that I think it is patronising nonsense, and I wonder what this Government will do if it finds that 8 <span class="highlight">women</span> are eligible to sit on that Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Particulars of ex-servicemen and <span class="highlight">women</span> employed in the Department are not kept as a primary record. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-87-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, a survey conducted in the Queensland Branch has indicated that there are 334 ex-servicemen and <span class="highlight">women</span> currently employed in the Branch. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-87-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, for the information of the honourable senator, the policy of the Repatriation Commission over the years until its staff was brought under the Public Service Act in 1947 was to give preference to employment of exservicemen and <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-87-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An amazingly anachronistic and uncalled for provision is contained in this legislation requiring the appointment of 2 <span class="highlight">women</span> commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time the rights of <span class="highlight">women</span> to participate in public institutions and public life had suffered a great setback since the early feminist movement because of the Depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s and the subsequent world war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The argument about the status of <span class="highlight">women</span> was probably at an all-time low in 1942. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if one is proffering some sort of egalitarianism through this legislation, I should have thought that a provision for at least 4 <span class="highlight">women</span> out of the 9 members would have been more realistic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to programs such as  Seven Little Australians, Rush, Luke’s Kingdom, Certain <span class="highlight">Women</span>, Bellbird  and  Power Without Glory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the question of the <span class="highlight">women</span> representatives on the Commission we find that a quite extraordinary and Neanderthal sort of provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the appointment of 2 <span class="highlight">women</span> Commissioners, it is all right to say that there is no need to have this provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in fact we live in a society where I think we need to ensure that there are at least 2 <span class="highlight">women</span> Commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand, the Government is prepared to make a quite unnecessary, anachronistic and even sexist provision for the inclusion of 2 <span class="highlight">women</span> on the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to accommodate the quite unnecessary provision of 2 <span class="highlight">women</span> Commissioners, the Government has actually had to go to the length of saying that the number of commissioners shall be increased from nine to eleven if this is necessary to achieve the balance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we have a measure aimed at the possibility of having 11 commissioners simply to accommodate an unnecessary provision for 2 <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We oppose, for the reasons I have given, the unnecessary sexist and patronising provision for 2 <span class="highlight">women</span> commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Director of Projects for the Australian Film Commission,  Mr John  Daniell, has informed members of the advisory panel on the <span class="highlight">Women</span> ‘s Film Fund that they have no decision-making powers regarding sponsorship of projects by the Fund, by what means will the original objective of the Fund, i.e., assistance for production of worthwhile <span class="highlight">women</span>’s films that have no alternative source of assistance, be safeguarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-64-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Prime Minister undertake to consult with the Australian Film Commission regarding the Commission’s guidelines for the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Film Fund, in order to ensure that the $100,000 absorbed from the cancellation of the Greer investment grant and the rest of the funds in the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Film Fund are used solely to sponsor projects in keeping with the stated objectives of the International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year Program and not merely to supplement the general allocation ofthe Australian Film Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-64-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I rise to support the Bill because it gives recognition to what one can call the forgotten <span class="highlight">women</span> of Australia, those in the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Auxiliary Services who volunteered to defend Australia in the Second World War. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">women</span> are now approaching the age when they want to make provision for old age and this Bill goes some way to giving them some peace of mind about their lives in the next few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides for <span class="highlight">women</span> who are in necessitous circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are in the community <span class="highlight">women</span> who served in the WAAAFs and want assistance to help themselves and to buy a home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this Bill men and <span class="highlight">women</span>, comrades in war, are equal in receiving help when they are in necessitous circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, although the same men and <span class="highlight">women</span>, widows and children and <span class="highlight">women</span> who are currently in the Services receive assistance by way of loans to buy homes, the <span class="highlight">women</span> who served in wartime auxiliary Services do not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> in the Services now serve beside the men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> in time of war went even further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1944 two-thirds of the defence forces serving in Australia were <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In wartime the musterings, working hours, duties, leave benefits, courses, living conditions and food were the same for men and for <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The motif that these <span class="highlight">women</span> wore on their wartime caps was the RAAF motif. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They volunteered for service in the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">women</span> worked hard to gain skills that were strange to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their male comrades will say that the Services could not have operated the way they did without the unselfish work that these <span class="highlight">women</span> put into their wartime jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If governments acknowledge that <span class="highlight">women</span> in the Services are now eligible for equal pay, equal opportunity, equal conditions and equal repatriation conditions, including home loans; if ex-servicewomen are eligible for repatriation benefits, for equal assistance when in dire or necessitous circumstances; if ex-servicewomen now are eligible for assistance with home loans; if the widows of ex-servicemen and, one would hope, the widowers of exservicewomen and Service personnel are entitled to repatriation benefits, including home loans, why discriminate against a handful of exservicewomen who seek assistance, not charity, to provide for their old age? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were 40 000 Australia servicewomen during the last war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">women</span> estimate that 12 to IS of their comrades require a loan and one would expect the same sort of proportion to apply in all other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been very successful and there is no reason to believe that these <span class="highlight">women</span> would be any less successful than the men and would fall behind in their commitments when their male comrades have not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am talking about the <span class="highlight">women</span> who worked in hard circumstances without complaint in Australia to enable men to go overseas to fight in that wretched war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless these <span class="highlight">women</span> had volunteered and left their homes and loved ones there would have been many fewer men able to go overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody can say that the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Auxiliary Services were well paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I ask the Government, even though it has presented this Bill which is very good and extends the benefits as they should be extended to the <span class="highlight">women</span> who served in the Air Force during the war, to remember more than the WAAAFs in necessitous circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">women</span> deserve their share of the spoils but they prefer the peace of mind that they gain from looking after themselves in the later years of their lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">women</span> have not had that right before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  experienced this when she transferred the funding of the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuge and <span class="highlight">women</span>’s health centre in Brisbane through the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have set up counselling services, operated buses for handicapped persons, and set up handyman services for the aged, <span class="highlight">women</span>’s shelters, leisure clubs, children’s groups- a vast variety of schemes all over Australia, depending on the needs in the various regions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that if people in the Australian community who have special expertise that would interest a government were asked to come forward and serve the government and the community for a brief period, there are men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who would accept that challenge, knowing that the position they would hold would be for a limited period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have always been interested in encouragement being given to Australian <span class="highlight">women</span> to participate in industry, politics, the Public Service and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is certainly surprising that there are only a few <span class="highlight">women</span> in senior positions in the Australian Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the senior positions have been described in this legislation as being for men and <span class="highlight">women</span> must surely give some encouragement to those <span class="highlight">women</span> who wish to become involved in or who are involved in public life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think Australian <span class="highlight">women</span> are not in senior positions in the Public Service because of a lack of efficiency, competence or whatever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is because Australian <span class="highlight">women</span> have become frustrated by the restrictions that have been imposed upon them over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure there are many <span class="highlight">women</span> who are capable of participating in public life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that eventually we will see such <span class="highlight">women</span> come forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I look forward to seeing more <span class="highlight">women</span> occupying senior positions in the Australian Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been motivated to rise by articles in the Melbourne  Herald  yesterday and the Melbourne  Age  today wherein it is claimed that  Mr Jim  Dunn, after visiting Portugal, released a report containing some rather frightening allegations, including allegations that Indonesian troops in East Timor at the time of the initial occupation and thereafter rounded up young girls in trucks and raped them, shot 1 50 men in a south coast town because they tried to stop troops interfering with their <span class="highlight">women</span>, shot entire families which lived in houses which displayed Fretilin flags, killed as many as 500 Chinese in the first days after the invasion, dug up graves and removed valuables, and used cigarettes and electrical instruments to torture <span class="highlight">women</span> in a special interrogation unit in the top floor of the Tropical Hotel in Dili. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is also aware of reports that Fretilin used civilians, including <span class="highlight">women</span> and children, to shield its soldiers in combat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It tortures men and <span class="highlight">women</span> in that country by applying electrodes to the various parts of their bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do Aboriginal and Islander <span class="highlight">women</span> living on reserves in Queensland not receive family allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-40-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aboriginal and Islander <span class="highlight">women</span> living on reserves in Queensland are entitled to receive family allowance payments under the same conditions as all other <span class="highlight">women</span> with children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-40-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable senator is aware of instances where Aboriginal and Islander <span class="highlight">women</span> living on reserves in Queensland entitled to family allowances are not receiving their correct entitlement, I would be grateful if he would inform the Director of Social Services for Queensland or myself of the details so that further consideration may be given to their case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-40-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, there are numerous examples of other <span class="highlight">women</span> in the community who successfully combine these dual roles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stress these figures as being relevant also to the consideration of the role of <span class="highlight">women</span> in society today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, in the current climate of unemployment one would think that <span class="highlight">women</span> with family responsibilities should be discouraged from entering the work force unless doing so is a matter of economic necessity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also I suggest that the Government should consider paying some allowance to such <span class="highlight">women</span> in lower income families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the present unemployment situation the voluntary reduction in the number of married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force should assist in dissipating the problem of youth employment which is one of the grave problems of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Almost 6 per cent of Australians are unemployed- 346 688 Australians- and we know also that there are many <span class="highlight">women</span> and others in the community who do not appear in the statistics but who would work if suitable jobs were available or who would work if child care facilities were available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that there are married <span class="highlight">women</span> who previously worked who are now at home not working and do not appear in the unemployment statistics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of preface, I state that I was particularly impressed by the spectacular parade of 1600 service men and <span class="highlight">women</span> in the Silver Jubilee Review by the Queen in front of Parliament House on Tuesday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Wriedt  will appreciate, the then Minister for Repatriation in the Labor Government was Charlie Frost, who was a big, powerful man but who did not relish meeting an army of 50 angry <span class="highlight">women</span> seeking to learn who would repair the houses and the fences since the War Service Homes Commissioner was not noted for speedy decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It so happened that my mother was one of those 50 irate <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Voluntary organisations and governments work together in many areas including aged persons homes, services for the mentally and physically handicapped, special services for migrants and youth, crisis centres, such as Lifeline, pregnancy support, <span class="highlight">women</span>’s shelters and drug contact centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is especially evident in connection with the employment of migrant <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know the response of those <span class="highlight">women</span> who have come through such an experience, the response to their unborn child that ‘you have sought me and found me and I will not let you go’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given pregnancy support, advice and understanding the <span class="highlight">women</span> concerned always come to the decision that the life to be preserved is a life which they have no right to destroy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The changing roles of men and <span class="highlight">women</span> in our society make it less unthinkable than it once was for a man to contemplate trying to bring up a family on his own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some 97.4 per cent of single parents in the labour force responsible for children under 12 years of age are <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those <span class="highlight">women</span> must go out to work to keep their children in a reasonable sort of life style. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the 1975 survey of inner city <span class="highlight">women</span>, taken for the purposes of the Henderson report, <span class="highlight">women</span> said that they worked for money for essentials like food and shelter and rent and wages to get to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They do not work for wall to wall carpet and a second refrigerator and a second car, although there are <span class="highlight">women</span> going to work for those things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> are as susceptible to that sort of pressure as anybody else, and they are under pressure to go out to work to provide those things for their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are <span class="highlight">women</span> in parts of Melbourne, and I can speak only of Melbourne, who go out to work because they and their husbands are paying between $90 and $150 a week off the mortgage on the house they live in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">women</span> are terrified that if they lose their jobs, if they become ill or if the children become ill and they have to stay at home, they will lose all that they have worked for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">women</span> are not out in the work force because they want to express themselves, because they do not like being wives and mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, <span class="highlight">women</span> get the worst paid jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For so many <span class="highlight">women</span> some money is better than no money at all, some job is better than no job at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that while 36.2 per cent of students enrolled for degree courses are <span class="highlight">women</span>, only 1 1.6 per cent of administrative, executive and managerial positions in the work force are held by <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For  Senator Kilgariff’s  benefit, may I say that the <span class="highlight">women</span> of Australia are not going to be used as brood mares to supply large numbers of people to fill up the holes in this country because we might be invaded by the yellow peril. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The day has long gone when <span class="highlight">women</span> were prepared to have sons to send off as cannon fodder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again may I say that it is a woman’s decision whether or not she has an abortion, and I will be damned if the <span class="highlight">women</span> of Australia are going to put themselves and their families at risk to provide this vast number of Australians who are going to people this country, including the far north. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not need to have anybody else keeping my conscience for me and telling me what I will do, and I do not believe that the <span class="highlight">women</span> of Australia need to have that decision made for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Government has done very little about <span class="highlight">women</span>’s health centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Government in Victoria has done little about <span class="highlight">women</span>’s health centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These centres are places where <span class="highlight">women</span> can go with confidence to find out how they work, how they should be treated, what is wrong with them, without being embarrassed, without being stood over, and with other <span class="highlight">women</span> to assist them with their problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the reasons why the funds had not been passed on was that the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Health Collective had a special condition, again stipulated by the Hospitals and Health Services Commission, that the centre should relocate if there was sufficient medical opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, the hopes and desires of <span class="highlight">women</span> were as nothing against the medical profession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If money was going to be made out of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s ill health then the medical profession was going to make the money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is up to this Government to remember that a vast number of <span class="highlight">women</span> who have no other place at which they can receive help want these <span class="highlight">women</span>’s health centres, and it should cut through such nonsense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span>’s refuges, such as they are, exist with little money, little hope of future money, and a great deal of lack of confidence about what their future will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should tell it to the <span class="highlight">women</span> who are living in terror of the night they wake up and find that the kiddy has a fever, that they cannot go to work and that they will lose their jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is talking about equality it should tell that to the migrant <span class="highlight">women</span> in this community who have so many distressing things happening to them with no relief and who cannot, in so many cases, even speak the language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is any special study being undertaken of the needs of dependent children of lone fathers or are the grants given to the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre in Melbourne and the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Trade Union Commission in Sydney, a combined sum of $32,400, for investigating the problems of lone fathers or just those of working <span class="highlight">women</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuge in Canberra has made a public announcement recently that it has inadequate funds to continue its operations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>am aware that there is some concern on the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuge in Canberra with regard to future funding arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At present, assistance for <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges is provided through the community health program which is administered by the Department of Health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the current financial year the Canberra <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuge has received a grant of $20,000 from the Health Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present we are looking at the funding for the future programs of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges and a decision is expected to be taken by the Government some time in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As soon as I am able to say what future funding arrangements will be the Canberra <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuge will be advised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am not aware of the position at this stage but other departments’ views have been sought as to whether a booklet of special interest to <span class="highlight">women</span> should be prepared. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With respect to the problem of nutrition and alcohol, surely it is not beyond any government of goodwill to make adequate protein and calorie diets available where Aborigines are living on settlements, especially to make it available to pregnant <span class="highlight">women</span>, to babies and to growing children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is of the essence of our recommendation that the Judges appointed to this Court (men and <span class="highlight">women</span>) should be chosen for their experience and understanding of family problems and should be drawn from existing Judges, members of the bar and solicitors, according to their particular suitability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She was well known in the 1840s as the first exponent  of the functions of a good neighbour immigration service for <span class="highlight">women</span> who came to this country, some as ticket of leave prisoners and others as bonded servants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps honourable senators read recently in the Sydney Press articles about the difficult nauseating jobs that <span class="highlight">women</span> have to perform in industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No doubt, in due course further mechanisation will be introduced and <span class="highlight">women</span> will not be needed in the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The real heroes of industry in some migrant families are the <span class="highlight">women</span> who do slushy work as domestics in motels and other places. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In families in Sydney and Melbourne there are <span class="highlight">women</span> who are doing unpleasant work because it needs no linguistic skills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But it worries me that <span class="highlight">women</span> after working for 9 years and 9 months in a job are suddenly told that they are redundant on the assembly line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It must have been a very unobservant foreman who suddenly discovered that these <span class="highlight">women</span> did not measure up to what was required of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Special assistance needs to be given in this area and I hope the Committee will address itself to the particular problems faced by these young people at school and by the men and <span class="highlight">women</span> living in the community to see what assistance can be given to allow them to make an adaption to the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security and follows a question on the subject of Queensland <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges which was asked in the House of Representatives on 3 1 March by the honourable member for Petrie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a fact that all States, with the exception of Queensland, are funding <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges from the Community Health Program funds which were given to them in the Budget of last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only 3.3 per cent of males in the work force had degrees, and only 1.8 per cent of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force had degrees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I quoted those statistics, honourable senators may have noticed the very seriously disadvantaged situation of <span class="highlight">women</span> in relation to skills for employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At a seminar held in New South Wales last weekend on technical and further education and on the crisis in technical and further education a lot of time was devoted to analysing the access of <span class="highlight">women</span> to technical and further education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the present method of collecting unemployment statistics does not give anything like the true indication of the rate of unemployment among <span class="highlight">women</span>, there is still reason to believe that <span class="highlight">women</span> who were employed in the manufacturing industries suffered a much more serious degree of unemployment than virtually any other sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This framework, not being an amalgamation, is a two-tired system- in the first place a Tertiary Education Commission co-ordinating, rationalising, a visionary body in itself, a body which will look forward to the future; look forward to the dreams and hopes of men and <span class="highlight">women</span>; look forward to the things of the heart, the soul and the mind in the quality of education and its fulfilment; look forward to vocational orientation, and in doing so recognise a changing world; recognise the need for changing institutions, recognise that in a world of limited resources there is a need for a balance, a rationalising or a co-ordinating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development: In view of the apparent lack of housing for rehabilitation purposes through the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges, can the Minister say whether pressure can be put on the States to give priority in allocation of welfare housing to the clients of the refuges? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a fact that the present entitlement of <span class="highlight">women</span> to the age pension commences at 60 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I assure the honourable senator that the Government has not in mind any proposal to change the age of eligibility to 65 years in the case of <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am referring to the extremely high participation in the work force of married <span class="highlight">women</span> of migrant background. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The rate is much higher than the comparable rate for Australian born married <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This extremely high rate of participation by migrant <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force exists because of the need for migrant families to become established in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most of the migrant <span class="highlight">women</span> working in Australia were working in areas such as manufacturing industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those <span class="highlight">women</span> do not appear in the unemployment statistics, because if they are married and the husband is earning more than $70 a week they are not eligible for the dole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If  Senator Lajovic  is genuinely interested in the extent of unemployment in migrant groups, I suggest that he address himself to investigating the unemployment amongst married migrant <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the financial plight of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges in the Australian Capital Territory and throughtout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall read to the Senate a letter written to the Prime Minister  (Mr Fraser)  by the Co-ordinator of the Canberra <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Refuge, because I think it summarises and expresses very clearly the problems being faced by <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges and the failure to date of the Government to face its responsibilities in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The total bed occupancy of <span class="highlight">women</span> and children at the Canberra <span class="highlight">Women</span> ‘s Refuge in the first three months of 1 977 only, was 1896 people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is estimated that in the financial year ending this month that 200 <span class="highlight">women</span> and 300 children will have used the Canberra <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Refuge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over and above this fact however, the members of the Canberra <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Refuge wish to stress the urgency of the need for funding for all community-based <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges presently struggling to function throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>None of the <span class="highlight">women</span> ‘s refuges that have been opened since your party came to power in 1975 have received any government funding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will be a tragedy for Australian society as a whole and for the individual <span class="highlight">women</span> and children who will be forced, because of no option to remain at the mercy of violence and/or alcoholic and mentally cruel husbands and fathers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The relatively small cost of funding fifty <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges throughout Australia should be compared with the escalation in costs to our society if refuges cease to function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, in many cases <span class="highlight">women</span> under pressure from their home situations may finally succumb to the extent of requiring psychiatric and in-patient treatment, with complete care of their children usually being taken over by a government institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we believe that you and the vast majority of parliamentarians regard <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges as worthwhile and necessary to Australia in 1977 and the immediate future, we ask that you guarantee funding for all these <span class="highlight">women</span> ‘s refuges that are constantly filled to capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This controversy, which was part of the discussions at Estimates Committee D, prompted some people in Canberra to look a little more closely at the activities of the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre Incorporated which was located at 3 Lobelia Street, O’Connor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Abortion Counselling Service says that the money goes to the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Housing Information Service which, as far as I can determine, is a non-existent organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An advertisement for the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Information Service at Lobelia Street states that it answers queries on abortion, amongst other things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A survey reported in the Canberra  Times  is attributed in the first instance to the Abortion Counselling Service and then, 10 days later, to the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Health and Counselling Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Capital Territory Health Commission states that it gives money to the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre at Lobelia Street to assist with the payment of the salary of an education/information officer for the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Information and Health Counselling Service’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At pages 103 to 105 they will see some preliminary questions by me in which the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre became confused - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that stage there became, not on my part but presumably on the pan of officials, some confusion between the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre and the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Estimates Committee D returned to the Commission on page 106 and my questioning about the grant to the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre continues until page 109. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I did not do so earlier because I did not have time and it is not related strictly to the report of Estimates Committee D.

    <p>The answer came from a Canberra woman who phoned the telephone number referred to by the Health Commission authorities as being the number of the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre Incorporated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She was given full details about how the service helped <span class="highlight">women</span> to go to Sydney for abortions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is sensible that in the Australian Capital Territory, which is situated in the centre of a State in which the abortion laws are perhaps more liberal than they are in the Territory, and the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Health Counselling Service should provide information for and against abortions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the facts are not only as may have been suggested by the honourable senator- that the Commonwealth Government is building child care centres in some areas- but also that more <span class="highlight">women</span> are finding it difficult to obtain employment, and what may have been a need in some time past is no longer the same need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This report, to which I have referred, explored the claim about married migrant <span class="highlight">women</span> in industry being trebly disadvantaged and found that that was the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that statement by the Minister shows  Senator Ryan  that the Commonwealth wishes to discuss with the States the matter of continued funding for <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges and that it shows the continuing concern which the Government has for support for crisis and emergency accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me that we are rapidly reaching a stage at which we need to provide funds to these local authorities in order to pay the aldermen and alderwomen to carry out their activities so that any person who wishes to nominate, stand and achieve election should be able to carry out the work of local authority representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-On 25 August 1977  (Hansard,  page 513)  Senator Thomas  asked  Senator Withers,  as Minister representing the Prime Minister, a question without notice concerning the role of the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Advisory Body Working Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Affairs has supplied the following information for answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Advisory Body Working Parry was established to draw up recommendations for the Government to set up a national <span class="highlight">women</span>’s advisory body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and will consult as widely as possible with <span class="highlight">women</span>’s groups around Australia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the subsequent consultations, <span class="highlight">women</span> and organisations were invited to raise any aspect considered by them to be relevant to the establishment or operation of such an advisory body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These were referred through the Office of <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Affairs to the relevant authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Premier there, Joh Bjelke-Petersen, refused to pass on funds to two <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges- one in Brisbane and one in Townsville. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned a little earlier the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">women</span> visit people at the rate of six a day each for every day of their working lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, why is the Government procrastinating in the implementation of this program while increasing numbers of people, especially young men and <span class="highlight">women</span>, are being thrown out of work or are unable to find jobs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I preface my question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, by referring to the fact that <span class="highlight">women</span> receiving supporting mothers’ benefit are allowed to earn only $20 per week if they wish to retain full benefit and that this limitation on permissible earnings is a disincentive for <span class="highlight">women</span> to get work and rise above the poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the receipt of supporting mothers’ benefit preclude these <span class="highlight">women</span> from registering as unemployed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equal rights with <span class="highlight">women</span> when claiming custody of their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other <span class="highlight">women</span> 1 have tried have been first- and second-year university students who are almost completely naive to children’s needs and that has been a failure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>of spouse) for men (or <span class="highlight">women</span>) comparable to the ‘C class widows pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is little comfort for supporting fathers to hear the Minister for Social Security,  Senator Guilfoyle,  acknowledge that they are the victims of a gap in the social security system or remark, in a historical context, that social-welfare legislation was written initially to safe-guard <span class="highlight">women</span>’s interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was even more surprised when this morning in my mail I received a letter from Kathleen Edwards, who fortunately still quotes herself as  chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Welfare Issues Consultative Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only two weeks ago in this House a report was brought down giving a wide ranging number of issues in relation to <span class="highlight">women</span>’s affairs that we should look at. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Welfare Issues Consultative Committee- were very pleased to have opportunity of meeting with you and discussing <span class="highlight">women</span>’s issues during their meeting on 28 and 29 March. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The thing that interested me about  Mrs Edwards’s  letter to me was that she enclosed a Press release in which she said that the sorts of issues covered in the submissions received from the community and matters raised by the members themselves included the question of increasing the mother’s allowance paid to <span class="highlight">women</span> pensioners with dependent children and the possible extension of this benefit to all lone parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I mentioned, a report from the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Advisory Committee to the Prime Minister was brought down in this Parliament two weeks ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from such delightful things as what the Committee should be called and the fact that its advisory role should be defined in relation to the Prime Minister and his needs, the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Advisory Committee advises that it should set up sub-committees, working parties or task forces as necessary, drawing on its own resources when appropriate and on resources in government and non-government areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The establishing and maintenance of effective communication with <span class="highlight">women</span> and <span class="highlight">women</span>’s organisations and all interested groups and individuals was done four or five years ago when  Ms Elizabeth  Reid was the Prime Minister’s adviser on <span class="highlight">women</span>’s affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee recommends that the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Advisory Committee explore means of overcoming language and other communications barriers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also recommended that the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Advisory Committee should raise awareness within the community of the situation of <span class="highlight">women</span> and of their varied and changing roles and aspirations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was also in operation when  Ms Reid  was the special adviser to the Prime Minister on <span class="highlight">women</span>’s affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we are talking about <span class="highlight">women</span>, we cannot go past <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has failed to recognise that the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges provide a security, a haven, for people in need in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen over the past few years the emergence of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges, and we have seen a change not only in the amount of funding for these refuges but also in the method of funding them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When and how did he become aware that the Queensland Government had decided in July 1976 not to pass on any Federal funds for <span class="highlight">women</span> ‘s refuges; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 have been informed that the Queensland Department of Health informed the Hospitals and Health Services Commission by letter of 20 July 1976 that <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges in Brisbane and Townsville would be excluded from consideration when financial allocations under the Community Health Program were determined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a situation in Western Australia where our own Premier not so long ago had his little bit to say on <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On a talkback program on the Australian Broadcasting Commission one morning he said something to the effect that <span class="highlight">women</span> in our community would not need the services of a refuge if they sought solace from their church and if they involved themselves more in parents and citizens associations and community activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can honourable senators for one minute imagine that <span class="highlight">women</span> racing off to a person whom she has met as a result of activities in the parents and citizens association at the local school and asking for solace and help? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During an ABC talk-back show,  Sir Charles  Court, after extolling the virtues of his own 41 years of happy marriage, said that his Government would not consider making funds available for further shelters for <span class="highlight">women</span> in need of refuge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  advice to such <span class="highlight">women</span> was to seek solace from the church, local parents and citizens associations and other community resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">women</span>’s collective has requested that the Prime Minister,  Mr Fraser,  clear up the great confusion that exists about who is responsible for funding <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many letters and telegrams have recently been sent to the Minister for Social Security,  Senator Guilfoyle,  and the Minister for Health,  Mr Hunt,  urging continuation of federal funding of <span class="highlight">women</span> ‘s refuges in the coming Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the number of bettered <span class="highlight">women</span> and children far exceeds the capacity of present refuges, compelling them to turn away many more than they can assist, it will be seen that if funds are cut any further the position of these <span class="highlight">women</span> will be indeed desperate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sixteen per cent of <span class="highlight">women</span> interviewed in the study were knocked unconscious during attacks, 83 per cent had bruises, 8 per cent burns and scalds, 8 per cent broken bones and 12 per cent had internal injuries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perth’s emergency night shelters are so overtaxed that dozens of <span class="highlight">women</span> and children are turned away each week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The lack of emergency accommodation available to <span class="highlight">women</span> in distress was raised in the State Parliament this week by a Labor back-bencher,  Mr K.  J. Wilson (Dianella). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said yesterday that about 2S0 <span class="highlight">women</span> and children were turned away each month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pressures on <span class="highlight">women</span> in unhappy domestic situations were immense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has not been any move by this Government not only to increase funding for the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges which are at present operating throughout the States but also to spend more money on providing the shelters for which <span class="highlight">women</span>, particularly those in Western Australia, have a need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that there are many <span class="highlight">women</span>’s organisations which are concerned about the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Electoral Lobby in Perth wrote to me on 10 August 1977 pointing out the fact that one refuge per thousand head of female population is necessary to provide adequate shelter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, one of the statements made by the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Electoral Lobby is that 20 to 30 <span class="highlight">women</span> with their children are turned away each day from the five existing <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges in Western Australia, all of which, incidentally, are located in Perth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Electoral Lobby goes on to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">women</span> have no option but to return to their homes, to continued mal-treatment which can lead to permanent physical and mental damage, and in some cases death. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a great need for <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must not say that purely and simply because it is <span class="highlight">women</span> who are seeking to have this facility made available to them that they are the only ones who would use it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the refuges also provide <span class="highlight">women</span> with an opportunity to make a real choice about their future living situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They provide <span class="highlight">women</span> with information on social security facilities that are available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They also provide <span class="highlight">women</span> with information on child care facilities, what they can expect under the State Housing Commission welfare housing project and all these things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, the refuges provide <span class="highlight">women</span> with information about child care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had massive expenditure cuts in real terms to most of the needy areas, such as in respect to Aboriginals and the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s and children services about which I have spoken already. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should now like to deal with the subject of <span class="highlight">women</span> and unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at that time the report said that almost half the married <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australia were income earners in the 1973-74 year but that most received less than $5,000 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That does not surprise me because we live in a society which has always tended to say that it does not matter how much work <span class="highlight">women</span> do, they are not entitled to the same facilities or to the same wage rates as men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only in recent years that we have found that <span class="highlight">women</span> are gradually getting equal pay for equal service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In May 1975, 42 per cent of all married <span class="highlight">women</span> were in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the years between 1968 and 1975 there was an increase of 12 per cent in the number of married <span class="highlight">women</span> who were working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the figures for this year, when they eventually become available, will show that there has not been a great increase and that in actual fact there are still about 42 per cent of married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Married <span class="highlight">women</span>, whether their income is required in their family unit or not, are not able to receive unemployment benefits if their husbands are working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We might have a lot of different ideas about why <span class="highlight">women</span> who are married go to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that a great number of those married <span class="highlight">women</span> who go to work do so because of economic necessity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of these <span class="highlight">women</span> to whom I have spoken do not even want to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps we should examine the situation that would exist if <span class="highlight">women</span> were not able to go to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are always reading reports of <span class="highlight">women</span> who are taking a great number of pills such as Valium and Librium to keep them reasonably sane during an ordinary working day or a non-working day if they happen to be nonworking <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps we could say that if those <span class="highlight">women</span> were unable to go to work a great number of them would be potential suicide cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In times of economic stress it is the married <span class="highlight">women</span> who are first to be put off from their positions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A former Minister for Education in the Western Australian Government not so long ago said that he was quite sure that <span class="highlight">women</span> really should not have higher qualifications because they were not going to be used in the main, and therefore, were not of any benefit and were only tying up funds that could be better used for other purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The impression that I gained from his speech was that he actually could not see any reason for <span class="highlight">women</span> in our community not being content to be factory fodder or office fodder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr MacKinnon suggested that <span class="highlight">women</span> studying for higher qualifications may be wasting their time . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 1976 government statistics indicate that SO per cent of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force are unskilled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidently,  Mr MacKinnon  wishes to see <span class="highlight">women</span> remain in the lowest paid, lowest status jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">women</span> move out of these jobs, who is going to fill them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a valid concern, and I do not doubt that some people will support  Mr MacKinnon’s  view because they do not wish to see the better jobs (men’s jobs) filled by <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, <span class="highlight">women</span> must not remain the lackeys. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude that <span class="highlight">women</span> belong at the bottom of the employment barrel will change only if <span class="highlight">women</span> do aspire to and do attain these positions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to look too at the schemes which are introduced  by  governments to sometimes threaten the livelihood of married <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was told that married <span class="highlight">women</span> are being put off their jobs and a position is therefore being created by an employer to take on a young person who has been unemployed for six months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Bantus gained great respect for these hardy white men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who were fiercely honest and prepared to fight to the death for their rights and freedom and,  Mr President,  they still are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bantu <span class="highlight">women</span> understand work a lot better than do the men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said before the Bantu <span class="highlight">women</span> appear to be more susceptible to this process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the example of the funding of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span>’s refuges throughout Australia are still without the commitment of a federal properly funded program for their support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example there is extensive unemployment amongst married <span class="highlight">women</span> who are not registered as unemployed but who are anxious to seek jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She describes a situation where 1,000 <span class="highlight">women</span> applied for 80 jobs recently advertised by the Public Service Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the fact that 1,000 <span class="highlight">women</span> turned up to seek 80 jobs demonstrates something of the extent of unemployment amongst married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>According to this affidavit there are 142 prisoners, 60 of them <span class="highlight">women</span>, held in solitary confinement in cells l.S meters long, one meter wide and just over one meter high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One might add to those bald unemployment figures the fact that a survey done by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in May 1977 showed that in Australia there were 72,500 people working part time who were anxious to obtain full time employment but could not do so, and that there were another 200,000 <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australia who wanted to obtain employment but could not do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can spend $2m for people in  Mr Fraser  ‘s electorate who want better television reception but we cannot do anything for people who are migrants, who are <span class="highlight">women</span>, who are unemployed, who are educationally handicapped and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures we are using do not include what people often call the hidden factor, the <span class="highlight">women</span> who comprise 3.8 per cent of the adult work force, who do not normally apply to the Commonwealth Employment Service and therefore are not registered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To put men and <span class="highlight">women</span> back to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the very large number- in fact the unmeasured number- of unemployed married <span class="highlight">women</span> workers in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is probably known, even to honourable senators on the government side, that <span class="highlight">women</span> in recent years have comprised about one-third of the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is probably acknowledged by them that <span class="highlight">women</span> workers contributed significantly to the growth of Australia during the boom period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, what is not acknowledged by the Government or by anyone else, it would seem, is the circumstances facing <span class="highlight">women</span>, particularly married <span class="highlight">women</span>, who have lost their employment and their livelihood because of the current economic recession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, if we look at what has happened to <span class="highlight">women</span> in our community who have exercised the choice to be part of the work force, who have shown the incentive to go out to work for the improvement of their families or for thenself fulfilment, who have had the motivation to be constructive and energetic about their community and about their families, we find that the Government has totally ignored what has happened to them when they face unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us examine some of those international covenants and compare what is contained in them with what is the real situation in Australia today, specifically in regard to unemployed <span class="highlight">women</span> workers and what the Government has done, or to be more accurate, has failed to do about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All measures shall be taken to guarantee <span class="highlight">women</span>’s right to work as the inalienable right of every human being and to revise, as necessary, existing laws, collective agreements, practices or customs which limit the integration of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the workforce on a footing of equality with men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State Parties shall undertake to adopt all appropriate measures to ensure to <span class="highlight">women</span>, married or unmarried, equal rights with men in the field of economic social life and, in particular <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that <span class="highlight">women</span> have constituted one-third of the work force until very recently, the unemployment rate for <span class="highlight">women</span> as measured is higher than the rate for men in every category, and this is despite the fact that the mechanisms for recording the number of unemployed <span class="highlight">women</span> are quite unsatisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say ‘married persons’, not ‘married <span class="highlight">women</span>’, because the Act does not discriminate on the basis of sex. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of that extremely discriminatory situation, most married <span class="highlight">women</span> who lose their jobs and whose husbands remain in employment simply do not go to a Commonwealth Employment Service office to register as unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The overworked and understaffed staff at the Commonweath Employment Service offices do discourage <span class="highlight">women</span> in these circumstances from registering as unemployed because they recognise that those <span class="highlight">women</span>, or men if that happens to be the case, are not eligible for the unemployment benefit and indeed their chances of finding employment through the Commonwealth Employment Service are very small indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generally speaking, married <span class="highlight">women</span> do not register as unemployed and therefore they are not counted in the unemployment statistics which are measured regularly by the Commonwealth Employment Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that so many <span class="highlight">women</span> do not register, for the reasons that I have just explained, the unemployment statistics still show a higher rate of unemployment amongst <span class="highlight">women</span> than amongst men in every category and in some categories it is quite disastrously higher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the difficulty of measuring the extent of unemployment amongst <span class="highlight">women</span>, an Australian Bureau of Statistics survey called ‘Persons not in the Work Force’ which was published recently claims that at least 200,000 <span class="highlight">women</span>- that is nearly a quarter of a million <span class="highlight">women</span>- are looking for jobs but cannot enter the work force either because there are not any jobs available or because child minding facilities are totally inadequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It shows that 17,500 <span class="highlight">women</span> had insufficient work experience to gain work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, of course, this Government has failed totally to establish proper retraining or work training facilities for <span class="highlight">women</span> in this circumstance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It shows that 15,900 unemployed <span class="highlight">women</span> are considered by employers to be too young or too old for work, whatever that may mean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, in a way that is quite different from that for men and in a way that shows that they are much more disadvantaged than men, <span class="highlight">women</span> often are judged to be too young or too old for work which they would be qualified to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find- I think this is particularly significant 11,000 unemployed <span class="highlight">women</span> giving unsuitable hours- that is, shift work- as the reason why they cannot take employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the case, of course, that the Government has maintained in a way the child care program which was initiated by the Labor Government, but it certainly has not been prepared to put resources or planning into it so that the majority of <span class="highlight">women</span> needing child care facilities to enable them to take employment would be in a position to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, those 11,000 <span class="highlight">women</span> who are unable to take employment, even if they could find it, because of a lack of child care services will continue to experience a lack of child care service in the forthcoming year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The survey shows that 19,000 unemployed <span class="highlight">women</span> seeking employment found that there were no vacancies in the sort of work for which they were qualified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What honourable senators may be aware of is that if <span class="highlight">women</span> with dependent children are looking for work and cannot find it their fate, of course, is to be relegated to the supporting mothers’ benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet that is the fate facing 7,400 <span class="highlight">women</span> with the care of dependent children who are unable to find work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no attempts to assist these <span class="highlight">women</span> towards economic independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has happened in the current economic circumstances is that <span class="highlight">women</span> who were welcomed by employers in the late 1950s and the 1960s because they were prepared to do the unskilled, the unpleasant, the low paid, the low status jobs- the production-line jobs in factories, the cleaning jobs in hospitals and so forth- are no longer wanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the workers who have lost those sorts of jobs are <span class="highlight">women</span> and, having lost their jobs, they are faced with permanent unemployment, with no support at all from the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time the employers were glad to have the unskilled, low paid labourer <span class="highlight">women</span>, particularly migrant <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Mulvihill  has often raised in this chamber the plight of <span class="highlight">women</span>, particularly migrant <span class="highlight">women</span> in factories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An excellent study was done of <span class="highlight">women</span>, particularly migrant <span class="highlight">women</span> in these circumstances who, not even speaking the language, were not in a position to claim decent wages and decent conditions and were not in a position to enlist the support of their union officials to fight for justice for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So these <span class="highlight">women</span> are thrown onto the unemployment market with no assistance whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed they do, although it is heartening to see that the Labor Government in New South Wales is taking some steps to prevent this particular kind of exploitation of <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures for April this year showed that of the 17,500 persons currently training under the NEAT scheme, only 7,100 were <span class="highlight">women</span>; 2,171 were <span class="highlight">women</span> training onthejob; 1,250 were <span class="highlight">women</span> in full-time training, a very low figure; and 230 were <span class="highlight">women</span> in parttime training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compared to the estimated figure of the Australian Bureau of Statistics of 200,000 <span class="highlight">women</span> unemployed, the 7,000 who have some sort of training available to them under the NEAT scheme is a mere drop in the ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise this subject tonight because it seems to me that this particular group of unemployed married <span class="highlight">women</span>, in most cases with dependants, has been totally neglected by the Fraser Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the plight of unemployed married <span class="highlight">women</span>, whose families are dependent on their incomes, is at least as serious as the plight of unemployed school leavers and for that group of unemployed no schemes have been proffered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that it is the ultimate hypocrisy by a Government which professes the philosophy of individual choice and persons having the right to pursue employment if they so choose to ignore completely the fact that at least  200,000  <span class="highlight">women</span> throughout Australia have been deprived of that very basic right; that is, the right to earn a living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is outrageous that most of those <span class="highlight">women</span> have suffered in financial terms and in personal terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister for Social Security in a position to comment on the criticisms made by the Archbishop of Sydney,  Sir Marcus  Loane, on the funding and operation of <span class="highlight">women</span> ‘s refuges and health centres in Sydney? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware that my colleague, the Minister for Health, had drawn to his attention the reported criticism of the Archbishop of Sydney regarding the funding of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Health said that in considering this reported criticism by the Anglican Archbishop it is important to distinguish between the services which are provided by the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges and the individual philosophies of some groups which support the need for such centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, that does not appear to be sufficient justification for disregarding the services which are provided to <span class="highlight">women</span> in crisis and emergency situations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Basically, the centres have received financial support in recognition of an assertion that the existing system of health care is not entirely adequate to meet all the special health care needs of <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, the rate at which the centres are being utilised by <span class="highlight">women</span> seems to provide clear confirmation of the need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are using the innocent men and <span class="highlight">women</span> of the union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fortunately, that move failed; but we have what appears to be a concerted effort within the union movement by only certain sections and certain leaders to destroy our way of life and to use the men and <span class="highlight">women</span> of Australia to do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These bare statistics do not take into account the number of married <span class="highlight">women</span> who would like to work but who are not registered and those people who have left school, been unable to find employment, and gone back to school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They included the development of a Navy supply centre and Army workshop facility at the defence establishment at Zetland in New South Wales; sleeping accommodation for the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Royal Australian Army Corps at Puckapunyal in Victoria; the consolidation into Bankstown of the Bankstown and Lidcombe government aircraft plants; modernisation of facilities, stage 2, H.M.A. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had elections that perhaps were thought would be elections on other issues, but basically the Australian people are concerned with what group of men and <span class="highlight">women</span> is best capable of continuing to operate the economy of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many <span class="highlight">women</span> like this sort of arrangement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Victoria this problem has been taken up by an organisation called the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Action Alliance under a very capable  president, Mrs Joan  Adamson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Jobs for the young will remain scarce years after the economy recovers because of the number of married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force, a top employers’ spokesman warned yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The director of the Australian Council of Employers Federations,  Mr George  Polites, said the present youth unemployment crises was largely a result of the increasing proportion of married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the labor force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The publicity which has been given to <span class="highlight">women</span>’s libbers and equal pay provisions for <span class="highlight">women</span> have brought some married to feel inferior, to think that they are not making a worthwhile contribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He mentioned the concern of the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Action Alliance for this matter but I notice that he was fairly careful not to go on and advocate the proposal put by the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Action Alliance for a housewife’s wage to be taken out of the husband’s salary, which would involve the setting up of a bureaucracy and the active discouragement of <span class="highlight">women</span> to go into the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will probably involve the establishment of a guaranteed minimum income scheme in the form suggested by Professor Henderson rather than by way of legislation which I believe, in the case of  Senator Lewis’  suggestion, will in fact actively discourage <span class="highlight">women</span> from working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One wonders why <span class="highlight">women</span> should not be allowed to use their skills and get the same satisfaction as men in the community if that is what they wish to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe families, including children, will be happy if <span class="highlight">women</span> who have skills and expertise are discriminated against in the work force as used to be the case in the 1950s and 1960s before we had equal pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> were actively encouraged to enter the work force in the 1950s and 1960s by the government of the day and by industry of the day because they were a source of cheap labour in a growing economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that to attribute the present unemployment problems to married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force, as  Senator Lewis  did, or to people having two jobs, as  Senator Kilgariff  did earlier, or to the left wing unionists, whoever they may be- we could talk about that at length- is getting away from the whole basis of the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we took the arguments of  Senator Kilgariff  and  Senator Lewis  concerning married <span class="highlight">women</span> to the extreme, I do not believe  Senator Walters, Senator Martin  or  Senator Coleman  would be very impressed when we insisted that they stay home rather than have incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The statistics on the unemployed do not contain thousands of married <span class="highlight">women</span> who once they have lost their jobs, do not bother to register for employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The severe effects of unemployment on <span class="highlight">women</span> generally are evidenced by the fact that two-thirds of those who are unemployed in the clerical and administrative category in New South Wales- which comprises some 25,500 people- are females and the clerical and administrative category represents more than 25 per cent of total unemployment in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Young <span class="highlight">women</span> are the most seriously affected group in what one must describe as an appalling situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances one must conclude that the true position for young <span class="highlight">women</span> seeking employment is worse than the statistics indicate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But when unions get to the stage of holding the whole nation and the people to ransom without regard for the suffering of <span class="highlight">women</span> and children, it is time we took a second look at ourselves as Australians and asked: ‘What are we doing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have had evidence of <span class="highlight">women</span> admitting to the taking of more than 50 compound analgesics a day, and such people represent 20 per cent of those who suffer kidney failure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe that at the moment men might be the greater drunks, but they are addicted also to tobacco; that at the moment <span class="highlight">women</span> might be in even greater danger with the use of analgesics and sedatives, but they are turning increasingly also to tobacco and alcohol; that our children are turning increasingly to alcohol and tobacco and we are afraid that they are now turning also to cannabis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the frightening things in the report is that analgesics which until now have not been seen as a problem are affecting the health of a great number of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the community who have no idea of the problem they are causing themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To point up that problem I shall quote from a circular put out by the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre which refers to a survey conducted by the New South Wales Department of Health in 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In particular, some of the factors which have influenced today’s decision include the increasing number of refugees entering Australia, the Government’s desire to improve access to language classes for migrant <span class="highlight">women</span>, a general increase in demand for English language classes for migrants, and the commendable way in which some employers are encouraging their employees to develop facility with the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any humanitarian will admit to the need for <span class="highlight">women</span>’s shelters because of the inconsistencies of the capitalist system, whereby profit, selfishness and greed are the No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are people in this industry who are saying today that the reason why the textile industry failed was that the Labor Party supported the principle of equal pay for <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In regard to additional funding, the honourable senator will know that in recent months a growing demand has emerged, for a variety of reasons including the specialised needs of refugee migrants, because of <span class="highlight">women</span> seeking more education, and becuse of the desirabilitywhich the Government fully supports- of upgrading the ability to speak English of those seeking jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of this serious disadvantage facing <span class="highlight">women</span> seeking employment, does the Government propose to set up any job creation schemes or employer subsidy schemes designed specifically to improve the employment situation for <span class="highlight">women</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to her question regarding employment opportunities for <span class="highlight">women</span> and what action has been taken by the Government in this regard, I simply point out that the various schemes the Government has intitiated in regard to employment, particularly of young peopletraining under the National Employment and Training scheme and the expansion of that scheme which the Government has undertaken, and the many other schemes to which I have referred from time to time- make no discrimination between men and <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those schemes are directed towards assisting and are intended to assist both men and <span class="highlight">women</span>, without any discrimination against one sex or the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-I do not think that those figures reflect in any way upon the success of the Government’s actual programs but they may indicate some special difficulty in relation to vacancies for <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind the Minister of a recommendation made by the Prime Minister that <span class="highlight">women</span>’s units should be set up in the relevant departments to deal with the special problems facing <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister why his Department so far has appointed only one officer to its <span class="highlight">women</span>’s unit despite an agreement if reached with the Public Service Board that two officers are needed to made the unit effective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister explain why there has been a delay of almost a year in the establishment of a <span class="highlight">women</span>’s unit in his department? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My own Department has been interested to establish, and has established, a <span class="highlight">women</span>’s unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the fact that earlier this year the Premier of Queensland refused to pass on funds that had been allocated by the Federal Government to two <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges in that <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator is talking about specific <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not know of this Parliament ever appropriating money for a particular <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuge in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The community health program, which involves a block grant to the States, covers funding for <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of the community health program for Queensland, the Government of that State did not give to the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges the funds which the block grant was given to cover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was arranged by the Commonwealth Government for funding to be given direct to the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges which were the subject of funds that had been made available by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Homeless Persons Assistance Act was introduced in December 1974 on the basis of a report by a Working Party on Homeless Men and <span class="highlight">Women</span>, which recommended, amongst other things, that capital grants totalling up to $5m a year should be made available over a three-year period to voluntary agencies and local and statutory authorities for approved projects- such as night shelters, reception and assessment centres, hostels, flats, day centres, special clinics and detoxification units- in order to upgrade and replace existing inadequate accommodation and to build new facilities for permanently and chronically homeless men and <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I referred earlier to the amount of money that is reported to have been spent on bringing 1,000 additional policemen and <span class="highlight">women</span> into the centre of the city of Brisbane on a Saturday morning to control a rally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am given to understand from a policeman who was involved that policemen and policewomen who approached their senior officer and questioned whether this action would result in a confrontation between the police and people who had a difference of opinion in respect of uranium were left behind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Removal of a provision which discriminates against married <span class="highlight">women</span> in relation to sickness benefit and bringing the income test for sickness benefit into line with that applying to unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has decided to remove an element of discrimination existing in relation to the eligibility of married <span class="highlight">women</span> to receive sickness benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This provision is considered to discriminate against <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was thought that at the end of three years the Government and the Parliament would be in a better position to decide, for instance, whether refuges for <span class="highlight">women</span>, which are at present funded under the community health program, should become part of the homeless persons program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She has said that a wider program may be needed and that the Homeless Persons Assistance Act may be a suitable vehicle to cover such things as <span class="highlight">women</span>’s shelters generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Grimes spent some time;I think not inappropriately;discussing <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges and setting out his views on how they might most appropriately be funded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that under the provisions of the Budget and under the programs of this Government the funding of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges has been assured for this financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not mentioned the effect of governmental neglect upon homeless <span class="highlight">women</span> and <span class="highlight">women</span> who may be seeking refuge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government claims, in classic doublespeak, that it is removing discrimination against married <span class="highlight">women</span> but, in fact, brings sickness benefits into line with unemployment benefits by altering the benefits available to married men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Social Services Amendment Bill is concerned primarily with assisting the family and righting in some of our legislation anomalies which exist at the moment in relation to <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have not found it necessary to scream <span class="highlight">women</span>’s lib. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have not found it necessary to appoint representatives from radical <span class="highlight">women</span>’s movements as advisers to our Government as the last Government did just to appease some of the minority vocal members of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Instead, we have quitely and practically set about passing legislation which will assist the family and <span class="highlight">women</span> in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has assisted <span class="highlight">women</span> who were, I believe, the most disadvantaged in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Previously <span class="highlight">women</span> were not recognised as participating in the contributions which their husbands made to that superannuation fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments mean that <span class="highlight">women</span> are now recognised along with their husbands as contributing to that fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> are entitled, as a right, to have widows’ superannuation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have extended the free Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service to include <span class="highlight">women</span> and not just the pensioners and beneficiaries who previously had eligibility to the fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision has been extended to <span class="highlight">women</span> who are not necessarily going back into the work force but just going into the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now wish to say something about the sickness benefit, especially as it relates to <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, the provision which will be affected by the legislation-  is considered to discriminate against <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, I think,  Senator Walters  said something about the situation of <span class="highlight">women</span> being improved by this provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not that a new entitlement is being extended to <span class="highlight">women</span>; it is that an entitlement has been taken away from husbands whose wives are in employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly a sort of technical equality- one could say an equality of disadvantage- has been introduced in the legislation, but I find it quite amazingly hypocritical that this change has been expressed in language which suggests that some new provision has been extended to <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That will be the real effect achieved by this provision, which is supposed to have some beneficial effect for <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am looking for the figure representing <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I did have the figure for the number of married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force, but I do not seem to be able to find it now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This time I shall not quote from an ABS publication, but there are roughly 1,500,000 <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think about two-thirds of those <span class="highlight">women</span> are married. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So approximately 1,000,000 <span class="highlight">women</span> would represent dual income families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Otherwise, it will be a very bleak Christmas indeed for many hundreds of thousands of men, <span class="highlight">women</span> and children, because parents do not have a fulltime job and cannot provide for their families the most meagre Christmas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the same recommendation Professor Henderson recommended that the supporting mothers’ benefit should be a Commonwealth responsibility, and that to maintain justice in the community home care help, infant welfare, child care and general accommodation services for <span class="highlight">women</span> in distress and children in distress should be upgraded and should be funded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As you may well know,  Mr President,  ‘railroad’ carriages are pulled at the enormous speed of 1 5 miles per hour by engines’, which in addition to endangering life and limb of passengers, roar and snort their way through the countrysides, setting fire to the crops, scaring the livestock and frightening <span class="highlight">women</span> and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will endeavour to uphold the dignity of the Senate, to pursue the interests of my home State of South Australia, and to add, if possible, to the ever increasing regard in the community for <span class="highlight">women</span> parliamentarians already engendered by that small but effective group which graces this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is not my intention to restrict myself to so-called <span class="highlight">women</span>’s issues or to put only the woman’s point of view, whatever that is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It emphasised that it would ‘continue its efforts to improve the status of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the Australian society’, that it wished to contribute to the ‘further development of internationally accepted principles of human rights’ and that it would ‘work to improve the quality of education at all levels.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span>, individually and as a group, are faced with a similarly frustrating situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once again, nice noises are made about the necessity to increase the status of <span class="highlight">women</span> but the only way that the Government can see of going about this is to recommend the setting up of yet another council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can this be more valuable, how can it achieve more than active, positive measures on the part of the Government to improve the general attitude to <span class="highlight">women</span> amongst the community as a whole and within government departments in particular? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No amount of advisory counselling will improve the status of <span class="highlight">women</span> if the Commonwealth Public Service refuses to promote equal numbers of <span class="highlight">women</span> as of men into senior positions, when married <span class="highlight">women</span> are singled out by some sections of the community and held responsible for youth unemployment, although these same critics conveniently ignore the 152,000 men who hold down two jobs, when the Federal Government allows into the country, and State governments permit the sale of, the amount of degrading pornographic material which is at present available? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How can <span class="highlight">women</span> ever respect themselves if their bodies are photographed being subjected to treatments that are not legally permitted to be done to animalssimply for the perverted pleasure of some men? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, the Government has two perfect opportunities for positively improving the standing of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the community, namely, insisting on equal promotional opportunities for <span class="highlight">women</span> in the Public Service and in banning all imported and locally made pornographic literature from sale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rights of Aborigines and <span class="highlight">women</span> will never be assured if the Government and other bodies continue to blinker themselves, continue to look at the problem from the wrong end of the telescope so that individuals disappear into the middle distance and injustices and anomalies are treated by talking rather than doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should consider the married <span class="highlight">women</span> who were in the work force and have now gone out of it but who would work and who would register for employment if work were available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to comment on that portion of the GovernorGeneral’s Speech which indicated the Government’s concern with <span class="highlight">women</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They consider it divisive and rather silly and believe that there is an idiotic fringe which indulges in it and that every time we have a debate on a subject some silly woman has to stand up and say where <span class="highlight">women</span> stand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I think it is time that people as serious as senators remembered that <span class="highlight">women</span> are people and acknowledged that governments, employers, trade unions and husbands do not take seriously the very real problems of <span class="highlight">women</span> in this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was disappointed to find that the only paragraph in the Governor-General’s Speech which dealt with <span class="highlight">women</span> directly was the following: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Government will continue its efforts to improve the status of <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australian society and a permanent National <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Advisory Council will be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that we were all very well aware that in the current situation <span class="highlight">women</span> are rapidly being reduced in status and that this country needs something much more than a permanent council to give them status, maintain their status and raise their status as citizens and human beings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this side of the Parliament we are certainly concerned with unemployment but I would have thought that even this Government would have taken into account the effect that continuing high unemployment has on <span class="highlight">women</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only has this Government up to this point blamed the right to equal pay, which <span class="highlight">women</span> won under the Whitlam Government, for the high rate of inflation that we have been suffering but also it has peddled the myth that married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force are the cause of youth unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reality is that the <span class="highlight">women</span> who work have to work so that their families may survive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I consider the fact that 41.9 per cent of all married <span class="highlight">women</span> 1 5 years and over were in the labour force in May 1977 and that those <span class="highlight">women</span> were doing two or perhaps three jobs- being a housewife, mother and worker at the one time- I am tempted to say: ‘Stop; give it up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hear people maintaining that <span class="highlight">women</span> should stay at home and mind their children, that they should let others do their jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How would society like it if all those <span class="highlight">women</span> stayed at home? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How could industry, which thinks that it can entice <span class="highlight">women</span> out to work when it needs a cheap labour force and send them back to the kitchen when there is a recession, get on without those workers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The May 1977 figures show that 43.4 per cent of all <span class="highlight">women</span> 15 years and over were in the work force in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">women</span> made up 35.6 per cent of the total labour force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time 323,300 unmarried <span class="highlight">women</span>- <span class="highlight">women</span> who had never married, were widowed, divorced or permanently separated- were heads of families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That figure did not include the <span class="highlight">women</span> who had sick or alcoholic husbands and spent their lives maintaining their husbands and families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if the working <span class="highlight">women</span> of this country stayed home what would happen? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What would happen in the general manufacturing area where <span class="highlight">women</span> comprise the bulk of the work force? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, <span class="highlight">women</span> can still be subjected to receiving less than equal pay and to having less than equal provisions and opportunities in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> now make up over 32 per cent of the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one thinks of the problems for <span class="highlight">women</span> who have the responsibilities of home and children as well as work, one is entitled to ask why those matters were not studied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidently, <span class="highlight">women</span> are to be regarded as working solely to earn pin money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this was the case, when <span class="highlight">women</span> had fulfilled that most important and satisfying role of mother, they could contribute during the 30 years of vigorous life they have left. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need legislation to ensure that <span class="highlight">women</span> are not ‘last in first out’ as is happening at the moment- last taken on and the first most easily sacked- because, it is argued, they have a husband to keep them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why are there not training schemes for <span class="highlight">women</span> in areas where there is a serious and increasing lack of skilled workers, thus enabling <span class="highlight">women</span> to fill those vacancies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why cannot those sorts of programs be put into effect here and now and why cannot <span class="highlight">women</span> play an equal part and have an equal opportunity to participate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many <span class="highlight">women</span> in the community who want to work and who need to work but who do not even know some of these jobs exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is there not some sort of imaginative information program so that <span class="highlight">women</span> can select a satisfying job, decide to have a go at it and train for it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that child care’ has become another expression which people tune out of their thinking in the same way as they do when one talks about <span class="highlight">women</span> ‘s rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment these difficulties place tremendous pressure on <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what is the Government doing to relieve some of the terrible pressures put on <span class="highlight">women</span> when they are unemployed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We already know that more <span class="highlight">women</span> are suffering heart attacks than was previously the case because of the pressure of being in the work force and of performing two jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What effect will all this pressure have on the health of the <span class="highlight">women</span> of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More <span class="highlight">women</span> will drink, smoke and take analgesics because of this pressure that is being put on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some research of a minimal nature shows that, when <span class="highlight">women</span> take the pill and drink alcohol, the alcohol becomes very dangerous because it stays in their systems longer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Research also shows that smoking by <span class="highlight">women</span> who take the pill is extremely dangerous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many <span class="highlight">women</span> take the pill because they have to stay in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where is there evidence that this Government is prepared to sponsor major research in many areas of health that concern <span class="highlight">women</span> generally? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pill has been introduced to free <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been introduced to free <span class="highlight">women</span> from having children, so that they can be sold into slavery all their lives, doing two jobs I might suggest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But does anyone care that thousands of <span class="highlight">women</span> have been used as guinea pigs because there are so many effects ofthe pill that are not understood? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government truly believes those words it will take urgent steps to provide employment for <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will look to alleviate pressure on <span class="highlight">women</span> caused by unemployment across the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that his statement that governments really do look at some of the things we say and really do attempt to solve some of the problems is correct and that the <span class="highlight">women</span> of Australia will be able to look forward to having a government that really meets their needs and does not just establish committees that may take submissions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She took the example of Australian <span class="highlight">women</span> and the example of the Australian Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The record of that Government was characterised by the establishment of committees such as the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Welfare Issues Consultative Committee, the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Advisory Committee which still has not been established but which we are told will be established one of these days and various other committees while, at the same time, the Government is cutting back on programs which were giving assistance to people in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are aware of cutbacks in areas such as child care, <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges, Aboriginal health programs and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By imposing such ceilings on government departments, many of which are of course here in the Australian Capital Territory, the Government has virtually said to many school leavers, to many graduates of tertiary institutions, to many <span class="highlight">women</span> seeking to rejoin the work force in the Australian Capital Territory: ‘There are no jobs for you’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to these immediate measures, the Government believes it of the utmost importance that a review be undertaken of the whole area of protective security in Australia by a person who has an appreciation of intelligence and security operations, and a concern for the liberties of individual men and <span class="highlight">women</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I conclude with a few words about the role of <span class="highlight">women</span> in society and the importance of the family as a basic unit in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In her maiden speech,  Senator Haines  referred to the necessity to improve the status of <span class="highlight">women</span>;  Senator Melzer  and  Senator Ryan  made similar references. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As this will certainly be the last AddressinReply speech I shall be privileged to make in the Senate, I remind the Senate that in my maiden speech some two years ago I referred to the role of <span class="highlight">women</span> in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, there are numerous examples of other <span class="highlight">women</span> in the community who successfully combine these dual roles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the argument I am putting is that if we were to support <span class="highlight">women</span> in the home this situation might not arise- families might stay together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the past 30 years there has been a dramatic increase in the number of working <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1947, 15 per cent of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force were married and only 7 per cent of married <span class="highlight">women</span> worked outside their homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By 1966 the number of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force had doubled and 50 per cent of them were married. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By 1975, 35 per cent of the work force were <span class="highlight">women</span> and 63 per cent of them were married. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bureau of Statistics figures for 1975 indicate that there were 505,300 married <span class="highlight">women</span> and 23,300 other females without children under eleven in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Studies of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force in several countries show that, although a woman is fully employed outside her home, she still does some 70 per cent of the child and home care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over half of these <span class="highlight">women</span> state that they would prefer either not to go to work or to have part time work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issue is not necessarily whether married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force are depriving unemployed juveniles of work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is a relationship between the over employment of married <span class="highlight">women</span> and the under employment of juveniles it springs from this major factor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real position is that, as in every other sphere of social and political life, freedom of choice should be available to married <span class="highlight">women</span> in this situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surveys by the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the Electrical Trades Union of New South Wales showed that those married <span class="highlight">women</span> who have children but who are currently in the work force would prefer to stay at home and care for their children if they were paid a relatively small amount of money for doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Tehan said that he wanted to say something about <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I was surprised that he appeared to adopt the attitude of getting <span class="highlight">women</span> back into bed and behind the kitchen sink. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In spite of the growing numbers of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the workforce, <span class="highlight">women</span> still have a socially acceptable choice about working or staying at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should dearly love someone to tell me what light work a nurse can do because nursing is one of the many heavy working professions which <span class="highlight">women</span> undertake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In May 1976 <span class="highlight">women</span> constitute 32.9 per cent of the work force working part time compared with males constituting 4.5 per cent of the work force working part time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Comparing the female unemployment rates for Western Australia with rates in other States over a fiveyear period, we can see just how badly <span class="highlight">women</span> have fared in Western Australia, the State of excitement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Figures show that two Labor States, Tasmania and New South Wales, have actually experienced a decrease in the percentage of unemployed <span class="highlight">women</span> and the third Labor State, South Australia, has the lowest percentage increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is no less criminal than his action in 1976 in refusing to accept a grant from the Department of Health to fund two <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges, one of them in Brisbane and one in Townsville. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Returning to the speech that I was making last night and getting back to my ‘State of Excitement’, because we in Western Australia find ourselves a little parochial, I cited some figures on unemployment in Western Australia, particularly the unemployment of <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope they have been able to assess the statement I made in respect of two of the three Labor-controlled States, that there has been a dramatic decrease in unemployment as it relates to <span class="highlight">women</span> and that in the third State there was the minimum possible increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But from the point of view of ethics- this will be repugnant to a few Government senators- I have been to eastern Europe many times and seen things with which one would agree and with which one would not agree, but I have never known a European radio or television station to use <span class="highlight">women</span> as show ponies in order to sell goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From her involvement with various <span class="highlight">women</span>’s liberation movements she has been in the forefront of some of this exploitation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just wonder at these people who talk about the virtues of private enterprise and how they try to exploit <span class="highlight">women</span> with some of these gimmicks to sell commodities, many of which are pretty shoddy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is important that society recognises that of all the provinces in which <span class="highlight">women</span> are occupied- they vary- she makes no more important contribution to society than she does as the organiser, defender and promoter of the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, the Government’s fundamental belief-  is that a better society can only be realised by giving the men and <span class="highlight">women</span> of Australia a greater measure of choice, power and freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not without significance that there is a correlation between the increase in juvenile unemployment since the mid- 1 960s and the increase in the number of married <span class="highlight">women</span> entering the work force during the same period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem cannot be solved by discriminating against married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force, as some have suggested; rather, the solution lies in Government financial measures which will recognise the economic worth of the homemaker, contribution to family support programs and thus reverse the economic discrimination now experienced by single income families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If those programs are adopted the majority of married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force who, according to recent surveys such as those conducted by the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the Electrical Trades Union, have been forced to enter the work force through economic pressure will have a true freedom of choice and the option to leave jobs, thus creating employment opportunities for the young. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, there are thousands of young married <span class="highlight">women</span> who want to leave the work force and start a family but cannot do so because of housing finance problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned that the advice that is being given to the Government, for example in the area of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s affairs, comes from people who do not have the home experience, the motherhood experience, that is necessary to give a balanced view to the Government on <span class="highlight">women</span>’s affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen the Government appointing as its <span class="highlight">women</span>’s adviser such people as Sara Dowse, who has latterly departed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sara Dowse was selected in March 1 976 to head the office of <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Affairs in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will enlighten the Senate by reading a parable by Sara Dowse- it was given to a conference of the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Electoral Lobby in Canberra between 17 and 19 February 1978- so that the Government knows what type of people are advising it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was at this time that she was able to persuade him that she needed assistance, and he commanded her to fetch several wise <span class="highlight">women</span> in the kingdom, to help her in her work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And just outside the palace walls there grew a tree of magic, and in that year that tree of magic, which was tended well by all the <span class="highlight">women</span> in the kingdom, grew many leaves and branches, and the branches brought forth a profusion of purple flowers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The king’s lady-in-waiting brought in several wise <span class="highlight">women</span> to serve with her, but most of the wisest <span class="highlight">women</span> stayed outside the palace to tend the magic tree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was much rejoicing in the land, among the <span class="highlight">women</span> who had been for many years unjustly treated, and they thanked the king for his special concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Outside the palace, the <span class="highlight">women</span> mourned the loss of their lady-in-waiting, and worried about their fate under the new regime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime the <span class="highlight">women</span> in the land grew more alarmed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many <span class="highlight">women</span> feared to leave their houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And outside the palace walls, the tree of magic began to wither, for the <span class="highlight">women</span> were not coming to care for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some <span class="highlight">women</span> came to break off branches, and these they put across the thresholds of their houses, or over the cradles of girl babies, to ward off evil spirits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fewer and fewer <span class="highlight">women</span> came to the tree, and those that did kept breaking off the branches, in the hope that these would guide and protect them wherever they might be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And soon the word spread that the handmaidens were captive in the palace and that only the <span class="highlight">women</span> could save them, and save themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The parable then tells of a magic tree outside the court- this being the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Electoral Lobby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point I am making is that the Government must have a balance in the advice that it receives on family matters and <span class="highlight">women</span> ‘s issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should have thought that the greatest problem confronting <span class="highlight">women</span> and girls in the employment area is the fact that young girls cannot get work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, as she realises and as I realise, there are problems for <span class="highlight">women</span> who have performed their family responsibilities and want to get back into the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that we misread the political thermometer when we proposed the abolition of the proposed tax cuts in order to get men and <span class="highlight">women</span> back into work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What police force is responsible for issuing Press releases which by innuendo identify potential suspect groups as Arabs, Indians, swarthy men, or <span class="highlight">women</span> opposed to abortion laws? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that the Association has had to raise its fees for this valuable service following the removal of the grant and that as a consequence some <span class="highlight">women</span> will be deprived of this service? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I pointed out by implication in a question yesterday, they include Arabs, Indians, swarthy men and <span class="highlight">women</span> opposed to abortion laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All honourable senators will be aware that the crime of rape and associated crimes of sexual violence against <span class="highlight">women</span> pose a serious and grave problem in our community today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think honourable senators will agree that current laws regarding sexual offences against <span class="highlight">women</span> are totally inadequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to give a very brief summary of the current state of the law which relates to sexual offences against <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the very distressing consequences of this requirement is that many <span class="highlight">women</span> believe that they must have been beaten half to death if they are to get the court to believe that they have been subjected to assault. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one probable outcome, yet at the same time lawyers, policemen and other persons in authority often advise <span class="highlight">women</span> not to resist sexual assault once it begins so that they will not be as severely beaten and will not be subjected to even increased violence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation for <span class="highlight">women</span> who find themselves victims of an attack of this kind is totally contradictory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Several thousand <span class="highlight">women</span> in Sydney were able to celebrate International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Day by having a march and a demonstration without any arrests, but some 200 <span class="highlight">women</span> who tried to do precisely the same thing in Brisbane found a quarter of their number charged for breaking the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I might briefly explain the situation of Timorese refugees in this country: There are some 2,000 refugees from Timor, most of whom are <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of the meeting last Saturday we met a number of <span class="highlight">women</span> with children who husbands are in Timor and are anxious to come to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the adult Timorese refugees are <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might add that the plight of <span class="highlight">women</span> who encounter this sort of difficulty in any country is made much more difficult in the Timorese people by the particular relationship between the father and the Timorese family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one adds to that the kind of separation factor which is now of two years’ standing and the stress that causes to <span class="highlight">women</span> with children who are on their own in Australia, one sees that a very real social problem is developing about which we believe the Government should be quick and alert to do something. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these things are emphasised even more by reason of the fact that these people are mostly <span class="highlight">women</span> and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">women</span> were helping not only to support their children but also they were attempting to help their husbands and other children in Timor by trying to get money through to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Health whether she can give any indication as to what progress has been achieved in respect of the joint Commonwealth-State funding under the community health program for <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges in Hobart and Launceston. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that for some months there have been consultations between the Commonwealth Government and the State Government with regard to the proposed funding of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my understanding that the Minister for Health is now awaiting a response from the Tasmanian Minister for Health about the terms of a joint statement, so that details can be announced of the funding arrangements with regard to <span class="highlight">women</span> ‘s refuges in Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could perhaps be said that Australian <span class="highlight">women</span> are seeking independence in many ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The lesser opportunities given to <span class="highlight">women</span> in other countries to assert their independence and to express their personalities may be attractive to Australian men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the statement made by the Minister for Home Affairs,  Mr Ellicott,  on the occasion of International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Day on 8 March 1 978, in which he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre in Melbourne … is the only organisation within the union movement providing support for <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that not a calculated affront to all those registered industrial organisations, including my own, which have <span class="highlight">women</span> members and which in fact have supported programs for their <span class="highlight">women</span> members over many years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know members of the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One comment I make is that I would have expected that the trade union movement would have given greater financial support to the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre in Melbourne because it is a group which is putting forward representations on behalf of working <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not take exception to the fact that  Senator Harradine  claims that all unions make representations on behalf of their <span class="highlight">women</span> members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just say that they have had remarkably little success in achieving many of the things that working <span class="highlight">women</span> require in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">women</span> at the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre require support if they are to continue the work that they are doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should hope that whatever statements were made by  Mr Ellicott  would lead to recognition of the fact that the working <span class="highlight">women</span>’s centre has not had any continuity of supportive funds since it was formed some years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that many voices can be heard on <span class="highlight">women</span>’s issues but some of the voices have not been heard as loudly or as clearly as they could have been over the past years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the statement were made that one centre provided the only voice for <span class="highlight">women</span>, I would have to argue that other voices are expressing the needs of <span class="highlight">women</span> in industrial and working conditions and in social conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is, of course, a universal assumption that members of Parliament are not <span class="highlight">women</span>; so some attendants have made that assumption and when a woman has attempted to enter the chamber they have not bothered to check their memories to find out whether she does have rightful access to that chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, that is apparently one of the difficulties for <span class="highlight">women</span> in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have seen <span class="highlight">women</span> come and go in this place with large handbags, to which  Senator Primmer  referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people ranged from girls of her own age to <span class="highlight">women</span> aged 20 years and 30 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have they ever seen the misery experienced by mothers with half a dozen children, children separated from parents or <span class="highlight">women</span> whose husbands are still in East Timor? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During a war involving a civilian population in tragic circumstances, a war which involved <span class="highlight">women</span> and children, there were no medical supplies and there was no capacity for hospitalisation or any form of international supervision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My wife meets the <span class="highlight">women</span> folk in the town and I meet the men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, I regret having to speak on the adjournment but I must do so in view of an answer that was given to a question by me on 16 March concerning the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span> ‘s Centre in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question on the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre was asked more out of sorrow than out of anger, even though I did confuse some of the metaphors at the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before attempting to explain why  Mr Ellicott  ‘s fulsome praise of the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span> ‘s Centre, which prompted my question to  Senator Guilfoyle,  was thoroughly inappropriate, there is one matter which I should make clear at the outset. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is precisely why I incorporated in  Hansard  the parable written by Sara Dowse, the former adviser on <span class="highlight">women</span>’s affairs to this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite simply, the Sara Dowse parable indicates that while she was working as an adviser to this Government her first loyalty was always to a non-Public Service organisation, the <span class="highlight">Women</span> ‘s Electoral Lobby, and that she saw the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Electoral Lobby and its attitudes as providing an integrated backdrop for the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Affairs Branch of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be a mistake for this Government to believe that the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Electoral Lobby expresses the wishes and aspirations of a majority of Australian <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be very vocal but increasingly other <span class="highlight">women</span>’s groups are coming to the fore to oppose the extreme viewpoints put forward by the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Electoral Lobby, <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Liberation and the radical feminists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Home Affairs,  Mr Ellicott,  has stated- and  Senator Guilfoyle  has given qualified endorsement to his remarks- that the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre in Melbourne is ‘the only organisation within the union movement providing support for <span class="highlight">women</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre in Melbourne is unrepresentative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It involves itself in matters not directly relevant to <span class="highlight">women</span> workers, is hostile to the official trade union movement and is a politically motivated organisation favouring the extreme Left and radical feminists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is simply untrue to state, as  Mr Ellicott  has done, that it ‘is the only organisation within the union movement providing support for <span class="highlight">women</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Victorian office of my union, that is, the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, which has a substantial female membership component, has a special <span class="highlight">women</span>’s unit employing five <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That makes it larger than  Mr Ellicott  ‘s Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stated that the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre was not endorsed by the Australian Council of Trades Union, and that is true. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know how many <span class="highlight">women</span> members are in the Waterside Workers Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stated that the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre was not endorsed by the Victorian Trades Hall Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been told by a union official in Melbourne that a possible reason for the official trade union hostility is that on several occasions <span class="highlight">women</span> associated with the centre have attempted to by-pass the elected officials of unions and enter factories and work places in order to spread their propaganda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The person who approached the organisation, being that union’s <span class="highlight">women</span>’s organiser, was Gail Cotton. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have stated that the Centre involves itself in matters not directly relevant to working <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, abortion is of interest- controversial interest- to all men and <span class="highlight">women</span>, whether they are working or not, but is the promotion of abortion the purpose for which Federal Government funds are used? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another item collected from the Centre was a broadsheet entitled ‘<span class="highlight">women</span> and employment’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One might think that we are getting closer at last to something which deals directly with working <span class="highlight">women</span> but the purpose of the broadsheet becomes clear when one reads right through it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was a special issue devoted to <span class="highlight">women</span>’s issues, but with a particularly unrepresentative moral and political approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The two principal <span class="highlight">women</span> at the Centre- Sylvie Shaw and Mary Owen- have both been prominently involved with the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Electoral Lobby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Senator Guilfoyle  announced last year the Government’s grant of $8,000 to the Centre and another grant to an organisation in Sydney, she stated in her Press release that she was particularly pleased that the Government had been able to assist these two organisations ‘which had been established by working <span class="highlight">women</span> to help themselves’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, the <span class="highlight">women</span> of the WWC in Melbourne are ‘helping themselves’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For that matter, by their involvement in non-working issues, they are claiming to speak on behalf of all <span class="highlight">women</span>, not just those in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Ellicott  ‘s remarks were an insult to all of those unions which, in their own way and under their own rules, free of pressure from extreme radical feminists, are attempting to do something for their <span class="highlight">women</span> members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This cannot be achieved by confusing the real issues confronting working <span class="highlight">women</span> with the type of radical feminist rubbish portrayed through the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an insult not only to <span class="highlight">women</span> but to the whole of the community and it is recognised as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They do not wish to see <span class="highlight">women</span>’s working issues become obscured and abused with non-working subjects such as abortion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre in Melbourne got rid of its partisan political propaganda attitude, confined itself to genuine working issues and was not so closely identified organisationally with WEL and other groups one might anticipate that the official trade union movement would reconsider its approach to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that an announcement has been made to the effect that the Federal Government has set up a Year of the Child Committee consisting of representatives from the National Council of <span class="highlight">Women</span>, the County <span class="highlight">Women</span> ‘s Association and the National Council of Jewish <span class="highlight">Women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As those three bodies represent specific groups of <span class="highlight">women</span>- professional <span class="highlight">women</span>, country <span class="highlight">women</span> and <span class="highlight">women</span> from one religious group -and in view of the fact that when last September the Union of Australian <span class="highlight">Women</span> was told by the Government Office of Child Care in Canberra that it was one of only three organisations that had shown any interest in the Year of the Child, will the Minister increase the membership of the Committee to give wider representation, including representation of the Union of Australian <span class="highlight">Women</span> which has done a deal of work on its own on this important matter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many organisations, including the Union of Australian <span class="highlight">Women</span>, which have made representations to be on a national committee or to work in connection with the observance of the International Year of the Child may find that they are invited by State governments to be on their committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Act also fails to make clear to people the fact that the Federal Government has made special laws and provided special treatment to many groups within our community, particularly disadvantaged groups such as migrants and <span class="highlight">women</span>, in an attempt to develop greater equality within the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think that there is any need to go over the important innovations in the original legislation of 1 976- for example, the introduction of a uniform 5 per cent contribution provision with an option to contribute to up to 10 per cent, a wide range of new benefits, and some special provisions important to temporary employees, <span class="highlight">women</span> and the handicapped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This concept was described succinctly by the then Attorney-General  (Mr Ellicott)  as follows in an address delivered at the ‘<span class="highlight">Women</span>- Today and Tomorrow’ Seminar held at Castle Hill, Sydney, on 13 August 1977: ‘A fundamental change has been the abolition of fault as an element in marital breakdown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, as pointed out in the monthly publication of the International Labour Office (ILO), The World of Labour and Development (issue of September 1977, Geneva), ‘often the heaviest cross is borne by divorced <span class="highlight">women</span> ‘ under systems of dissolution of marriage in which fault plays no role or only an increasingly residual part (ibid., p. 13). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Commonwealth were to provide employer financed benefits for divorced men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who were formerly married to scheme members or for non-dependent separated men and <span class="highlight">women</span> married to scheme members, public and private sector schemes would criticise the Government for pacesetting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for Social Security: Is it true that <span class="highlight">women</span> who are single parents and who lose employment are given a single mother’s allowance rather than unemployment benefit? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As <span class="highlight">women</span> on single mother’s pensions are subject to security officers investigating their premises and their beds to ascertain whether or not they have regular male visitors but those on unemployment benefits are not, will <span class="highlight">women</span> who are placed on a single mother’s pension in those circumstances be exempt from such supervision? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I rise on the adjournment debate to acquaint the Senate with some of the real facts regarding the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seemed to be an attempt to smear hard-working devoted <span class="highlight">women</span> with the obvious purpose of denying government funding for the Centre because these people who run the Centre are not identified with  Senator Harradine  ‘s faction in the trade union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a time when <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force are under great pressure, at a time when they need assistance and advice, it is irresponsible in my opinion for a member of Parliament to add to that burden and it is particularly irresponsible for a member of Parliament who pretends to have expertise and experience in the trade union movement to add to that burden on <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the moment 43.4 per cent of all <span class="highlight">women</span> 15 years and over are in the Australian work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, 2,204,600 <span class="highlight">women</span> make up 35.6 per cent of the total labour force in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In May 1977 41.9 per cent of all married <span class="highlight">women</span> 15 years and over were in the labour force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In February 1977 322,300 unmarried <span class="highlight">women</span> were heads of families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This survey excluded <span class="highlight">women</span> who had alcoholic or sick husbands not earning an income and so had to be the bread winners in the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In May 1977 41.5 per cent of employed married <span class="highlight">women</span> worked part time on average 14.2 hours a week and 40 per cent of married <span class="highlight">women</span> were looking for part-time work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the situation in which this <span class="highlight">Women</span> ‘s Centre operates in Melbourne and this is the Centre that  Senator Harradine  sets out to rubbish and to give all sorts of strange connotations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ACSPA Committee on <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Affairs established the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre in July 1975 through an International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year Grant from the Federal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Centre was set up with the intention of informing unions about specific problems facing <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force; to encourage <span class="highlight">women</span> to join their appropriate union; to educate <span class="highlight">women</span> about trade unions and to encourage them to participate in union activity and to seek decision-making positions within the unions; to provide information and support for <span class="highlight">women</span> who have problems which affect their work or ability to get work; to bring a grass-roots woman’s view of the effect of government policies and legislation to the attention of government Ministers and departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Centre was represented on the ACTU committee that set up the Federal Union Conference that discussed the ACTU Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Charter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We urge that in the proposed unification between ACSPA and the ACTU that both Peak Councils recognise the role of a Working <span class="highlight">Women</span> ‘s Centre and the need for its continuity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ACTU in conjunction with other Peak Councils and through its affiliated branches and unions should initiate the investigation of the possibility of establishing centres similar in concept to that of the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre, in other States, which would be accessible to all trade unionists’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Harradine  cast doubt on the fact that this was the only working <span class="highlight">women</span>’s centre in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody has ever claimed that it is the only <span class="highlight">women</span> ‘s centre but it is the only centre that provides a service for all <span class="highlight">women</span> who want to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the Centre has been invited to join several government committees including the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Welfare Issues Consultative Group in the Department of Social Security, the Victorian Government Department of Labour and Industry’s Ongoing Activities of Safety Convention, the Victorian Premier’s Migrant Advisory Committee and Equal Opportunities in Schools committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Centre also represents ACSPA on the Australian Public Service  Joint  Council Sub-committee on <span class="highlight">Women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inquiry into human relationships praised the work of the Centre and recommended that similar centres be established in other States because of the advice, assistance and encouragement that it gave to working <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Harradine maintained that the Centre had become involved in matters that were not directly related to <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to provide information and support for <span class="highlight">women</span> who have problems which affect their work or their ability to get work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That covers a multitude of problems, including the sorts of problems that this Centre attempts to assist <span class="highlight">women</span> with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is nobody else to whom working <span class="highlight">women</span> can turn, nobody who even attempts to answer the sorts of problems that arise in the everyday working lives of these <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of abortion always excites  Senator Harradine,  but it is just another piece of information for <span class="highlight">women</span> who work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the current economic climate brought about by this Government’s policy and brought about by the pressure these <span class="highlight">women</span> are under because this Government will do nothing about unemployment, especially unemployment as it affects <span class="highlight">women</span>, <span class="highlight">women</span> are not able to have babies which they may want to have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The trade union movement in this country has done precious little about the fact that it now takes two people’s wages to keep a family and the days when one man’s wages were sufficient to keep a wife and family and <span class="highlight">women</span> did not have to work have gone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what has  Senator Harradine  done to make sure that in the first place <span class="highlight">women</span> do not have to go to work to keep their families above the bread line? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has he done to make sure that information on contraception, for instance, is readily available to <span class="highlight">women</span> who work, to <span class="highlight">women</span> who do two jobs all their lives? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has he done to make sure that counselling is readily available to <span class="highlight">women</span> who work at two jobs all their lives? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Harradine does not know the pressures that push <span class="highlight">women</span> to have abortions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most humane understanding men who want to understand the pressures and the problems of <span class="highlight">women</span> who face abortion do not understand because they are not <span class="highlight">women</span>, and certainly  Senator Harradine  with his narrow inhibited view would find it impossible to understand the pressures to which <span class="highlight">women</span> are subjected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He exhibits a great desire to be the keeper of <span class="highlight">women</span> ‘s consciences but we do not need him as a keeper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Might I remind  Senator Harradine  that that is exactly how the majority of <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australia feel about the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a woman in distress and under pressure facing abortion rings the Centre for advice, she not only gets information about where to find a counselling service but also she is directed to the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Action Alliance which gives information and assistance in some ways to <span class="highlight">women</span> who do not want abortions and advises <span class="highlight">women</span> against abortions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Centre does not exist to push working <span class="highlight">women</span> into having abortions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-That is the sort of material on which the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre concentrates and which the <span class="highlight">women</span> work very hard to produce and to make sure that it reaches people who need it and who need to be reminded of those sorts of problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Groups leave material of a very varied nature and whatever is left there for <span class="highlight">women</span> to read and mull over is not necessarily endorsed by the Centre; nor is it necessarily endorsed by ACSPA. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But these people believe that this sort of information has to be made available somewhere to <span class="highlight">women</span> and this is one way of doing it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been told by a union official in Melbourne that a possible reason for the official trade union hostility is that on several occasions <span class="highlight">women</span> associated with the Centre have attempted to by-pass the elected officials of unions and enter factories and work places in order to spread their propaganda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place, there is no official trade union hostility to the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre and, secondly,  Senator Harradine  gives no information of those instances when the Centre has bypassed the elected officials of unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact the representatives of the Centre assure me that at no time have employees of that Centre entered a union shop without the consent of the union concerned and that on most occasions when they have gone into union shops they have gone with a trade union official to assist the trade union official and to have him assist them in speaking to the <span class="highlight">women</span> on the shop floor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What contact has the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre with the trade union movement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The two hard working and over-worked <span class="highlight">women</span> who work in the Centre personally visit trade unions for discussions with officials- evidence can be given of that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their paper <span class="highlight">Women</span> at Work’ is distributed through trade unions and in some instances unions have acknowledged that whereas the <span class="highlight">women</span> tend not to read the official trade union journal, they most certainly read this publication because it includes matters which appeal specifically and immediately to them, and is of some assistance to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre refers <span class="highlight">women</span> who approach the Centre to the appropriate union for their jobs and they give information to the organisers to follow up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre is the only centre in Victoria set up solely to support all working <span class="highlight">women</span>, and those <span class="highlight">women</span> who want to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is providing valuable and worthwhile service to those <span class="highlight">women</span> and it deserves the utmost support from all thinking people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am forced to rise to answer the statements which have been made by  Senator Melzer  in respect of the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a matter which is of significance and importance not only to the <span class="highlight">women</span> of Australia but also to those people working for the Federal Government who are concerned with ensuring that public moneys are properly accounted for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the record, the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span> ‘s Centre, which is not recognised by the Australian Council of Trade Unions or by the Victorian Trades Hall Council, has received $40,000 from the International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year Secretariat, $8,000 in January 1977 from the Department of Social Security for child care study, $6,300 in April 1977 from a Federal Government grant, $200 in July-August 1977 from the Australia Council for arts information for the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre newsletter, a total of $54,500. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I rose because I was angered by the statement of the Minister for Home Affairs  (Mr Ellicott)  that the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre was the only organisation within the trade union movement providing support for <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did so because I am President of a trade union, 70 per cent of whose members are <span class="highlight">women</span>, and I take strong exception to that sort of statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I went on to make a well-founded comment that the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre in Melbourne is not the only organisation within the union movement providing support for <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre in Melbourne is unrepresentative, it involves itself in matters not directly relevant to <span class="highlight">women</span> workers, it is hostile to the official trade union movement and it is a politically motivated organisation favouring the extreme Left and radical feminists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is simply untrue for  Mr Ellicott  to say that it is the only organisation within the union movement providing support for <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Melzer  referred to the ACTU’s Special Unions Conference on the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Chaner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Conference passed a resolution which purported to support the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Conference purported to pass a resolution which purported to give supported to the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The resolution purporting to give support to the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span> ‘s Centre was ruled out of order by  President  Hawke as being contrary to the decisions of the Biennial Congress of the ACTU in Sydney on 13 September 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That resolution, which was proposed at the ACTU’s Special Unions Conference and second by  Mr Ted  Bull, the Vice-President of the Communist Party of Australia, Marxist-Leninist, and the Secretary of the Melbourne branch of the Waterside Workers Federation, of which there are no <span class="highlight">women</span> members, was opposed and rejected by the ACTU Congress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the unit wage was introduced I have been vocal in my support for increased child endowment and in my support for a mother’s allowance which would entitle and enable <span class="highlight">women</span> to make a true free choice as to whether or not they will go out to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts of life are these: Because the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Working Centre and its like oppose a proper mother’s allowance <span class="highlight">women</span> are forced to go out to work to make ends meet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let it not be forgotten that these are the radical feminists who are the real enemies of justice for the vast majority of <span class="highlight">women</span>, <span class="highlight">women</span> who are working in the home doing the most important job in the world, raising future citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the Minister to the fact that the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span> ‘s Centre does in fact promote a profit-oriented abortion clinic in Melbourne, namely, the clinic operated by  Dr Bertram  Wainer and associates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here are documents from the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was pointing out that the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre is a proponent of and an agent for  Dr Bertram  Wainer’s profit oriented abortion clinic in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have an admission by  Senator Melzer  that the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre is a politically oriented organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She admits that this is the sort of literature that is available at and distributed and disseminated by the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sara Dowse was formerly the Assistant Secretary of the Office of <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Affairs in the Department of Prime <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Put quite simply, the Sara Dowse parable indicates that whilst she was working as an adviser to this Government, her first loyalty was to a non-Public Service organisation, the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Electoral Lobby and that she saw WEL and its attitudes as providing an integrated backdrop for the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Affairs Office of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I deny the statement she made that <span class="highlight">women</span> have been referred to <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Action Alliance - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Because I have contacted <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Action Alliance and it denies that any <span class="highlight">women</span> have reached it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it cannot deny what it does not know, but it can say that no <span class="highlight">women</span> have come to it from the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now  Senator Melzer,  in supporting this situation, is supporting those who support also the Union of Australian <span class="highlight">Women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think she yesterday, or on Friday, raised a question as to why the Union of Australian <span class="highlight">Women</span> was not associated with something or other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know what the Union of Australian <span class="highlight">Women</span> is: It is really an arm of the Socialist Party of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is affiliated with the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s International Democratic Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am raising it because the Government gets into problems with the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre because of the advice it gets from its Home Affairs Office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government could get into a lot of international trouble if, as has occurred, reports going to international bodies from the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Affairs Bureau of the Department, via the Department of Foreign Affairs, put forward the concept that the Union of Australian <span class="highlight">Women</span> and the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s International League for Peace and Freedom are the only organisations in Australia dealing with <span class="highlight">women</span>’s affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Melzer  put up a great case and the only thing with which he disagreed concerned some association with the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Action Alliance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope to God he never does it again while we are here, because  Senator Harradine  then wanted to show that there was more than one <span class="highlight">women</span>’s organisation in Australia; that there were a number. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He then went on to suggest that the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre has received $54,000 of government money for various purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not one accusation was made by the honourable senator in the whole of his remarks about this money being spent for some other purpose by the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one can say that the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre in Victoria has not done a good job in advising <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>We know the necessity for <span class="highlight">women</span> to be part of the work force, and the assistance which is required to enable them to be part of the work force is justified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This assistance is necessary in view of the difficulties of married <span class="highlight">women</span> undertaking this new role and their entry into the trade union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator uses this as an argument to suggest that the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre should be ostracised and that the trade union movement has no time for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Senate should be somewhat indebted to  Senator Harradine  for clarifying this matter and should be greatly indebted to  Senator Melzer  for the role she has told us that these <span class="highlight">women</span> play in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although there is no evidence of an association with  Mrs Chisholm,  the brig  Waverley was  a ship of the period and its incorporation in the design of the $5 note is not considered by the Bank to be inappropriate in the context of showing  Mrs Chisholm  against a background of <span class="highlight">women</span> and children of her time and ships and Sydney streets of the period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-6">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question to the Minister for Social Security refers to an allegation made by  Senator Harradine  in the adjournment debate last night to the effect that the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre is a proponent of and an agent for  Dr Bertram  Wainer’s fertility control clinic in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because this allegation maliciously and mischievously implies that the Working <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre gains some sort of agent’s fee or commission from  Dr Wainer’s  clinic, I ask the Minister to confirm the fact that the Centre receives no payments from the clinic for making information of this kind available to those <span class="highlight">women</span> who seek it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Does the Commonwealth Government intend to allocate funds to Queensland <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges before the end of the 1977-78 financial year, as was indicated by the Queensland Minister for Welfare Services,  Mr John  Herbert  (The Telegraph,  27 March 1978); if so: (a) what is the total amount of funding involved; (b) which <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges are to receive funding; and (c) how much will each receive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have previous Commonwealth funds provided to the Queensland Government for <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges not been passed on by the Queensland Government; if so (a) what are the details of the funds involved; (b) has the funding concerned been returned to the Commonwealth; if not, to what use has it been put; and (c) does the Government have any guarantee that the funds listed in ( 1 ) will be passed on by the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) In the 1977-78 Budget context, I announced that up to $1m of Community Health Program funds would be made available for the funding of additional <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government had every intention of allocating a proportion of the $lm to Queensland to fund additional <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges in 1977-78. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It follows that I am not yet able to provide details concerning the total amount of funding involved, which <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges are to receive funding or how much each will receive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Commencing in 1976-77, Commonwealth assistance under the Community Health Program has taken the form of annual block grants to each State for the State’s total program of approved projects including <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the 1976-77 Community Health Program block grant to Queensland was approved, two on-going <span class="highlight">women</span> refuges in Queensland- one at Brisbane and one at Townsville- were included in the approved program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the Queensland Government’s stand on this matter, the Commonwealth has departed from the block grant system in relation to the two <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges mentioned above and direct Commonwealth funding of these two refuges was commenced during this financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the basic issues encompassed by the current negotiations referred to above is that Commonwealth funds will be passed on to any additional <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges which may be approved under the Community Health Program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a joint Press statement issued on 28 April by the Commonwealth Minister for Health and the Queensland Minister for Welfare which related to funding arrangements for <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do clarify the position to the extent of saying that a statement was made by the Minister for Health on the agreed arrangements for the funding of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges and, as was stated by  Senator Martin,  there is now an arrangement between the State and Federal governments to fund this welfare measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Health aware that under the medical benefits tables there is no provision for reimbursement for the purchase of dental mouthguards by sports men and <span class="highlight">women</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Relations seen in today’s  Australian Financial Review  a letter citing statistics that demonstrate the extent of unemployment amongst <span class="highlight">women</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the figures show that the total unemployment amongst <span class="highlight">women</span> is 10.4 per cent compared with a 6 per cent male unemployment rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures go through the various categories showing that in every category, including married and unmarried <span class="highlight">women</span> and so on, the unemployment of <span class="highlight">women</span> is very much higher than unemployment of men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, does the Minister agree that they establish that <span class="highlight">women</span> are severely disadvantaged in the current unemployment crisis? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many members of this Parliament have, at some time, stressed the need for men and <span class="highlight">women</span> of vision and ability to stand for Parliament, especially if those men and <span class="highlight">women</span> believe that they can make a significant contribution to serving their fellow Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This group includes large numbers of those who are isolated at home (especially <span class="highlight">women</span>), elderly migrants (whose numbers are expected to increase dramatically in the course of the next decade), those from smaller ethnic groups (whose own support services are limited), migrant <span class="highlight">women</span> at work and the children of migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amount of work and research that went into this submission indicates a growing interest in the area by the young men and <span class="highlight">women</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That this item covers a legally and medically approved procedure, and its removal or modification would have the most serious social, economic and medical repercussions for many thousands of Australian <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In May 1977 the unemployment rate for <span class="highlight">women</span> was 7.3. per cent; a year later it was 8 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the hardest hit group, young persons 15 to 19 years of age, looking for their first jobs, we find that in May 1977 there were 16,100 <span class="highlight">women</span> unemployed; a year later there were 23,900 young <span class="highlight">women</span> in this category; that is, 18.7 per cent of <span class="highlight">women</span> between 15 and 19 years of age looking for their first jobs were unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The unemployment rate now for migrant <span class="highlight">women</span> in the 1 5 to 19 years age group is 1 9.7 per cent and for males 19.2 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 per cent for <span class="highlight">women</span> and 5.6 per cent for men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, he did not mention what is perhaps the largest and most neglected category, the category of unemployed <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It emerges very clearly in the statistics I have just read to the Senate that unemployment amongst <span class="highlight">women</span> in all age groups, but particularly in the younger age groups, is significantly higher than unemployment amongst men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is happening with regard to unemployed married <span class="highlight">women</span> is that their plight is being hidden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because unemployed married <span class="highlight">women</span> whose husbands are in employment are not entitled to benefit they usually fail to register at CES Offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another situation about which I have received many personal complaints occurs when married <span class="highlight">women</span> are laid off, thus being deprived of the income upon which their families were dependent, either solely or partly, for the maintenance of their standard of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had many reports of married <span class="highlight">women</span> actually being discouraged from reporting regularly to the CES. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not really know how many unemployed <span class="highlight">women</span> are in this category; that is, unemployed but not counted in any of the mechanisms for counting the unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, a recent study in the United States showed that for every 100 <span class="highlight">women</span> who were laid off, 70 of themthat is 70 per cent of <span class="highlight">women</span> who had lost thenjobs dropped out of the labour force and were no longer counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From my own experience and study of this problem I believe that the situation of unemployed married <span class="highlight">women</span> is a very grave one indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no indication that the legislation before us will offer any better services to unemployed married <span class="highlight">women</span> seeking employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if the CES offices are going to become more efficient and better co-ordinated, if they are going to have more and better trained staff- all the things suggested in the Minister’s second reading speech- then I hope that married <span class="highlight">women</span> who lose their jobs will get assistance from the CES in the same way as any other person who loses his job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Servicemen had to be rehabilitated and the wonderful <span class="highlight">women</span> of this country who kept the wheels of industry moving and the home fires burning had to be gradually withdrawn from industry and replaced by the men who were returning from the Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government has also deplored the trials and sentencing of other courageous men and <span class="highlight">women</span> associated with the human rights movement in the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-51-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The means test will be the same means test as that applied at the age of 65 years or, in the case of <span class="highlight">women</span>, at the age of 60 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have the incredibly stupid situation in a so-called civilised country of hundreds of thousands of young couples wanting to build homes, with thousands of men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who can build homes unemployed or being diverted to other industries, and all we can do is to go back to 1972 or 1973 to what the Labor Government did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rising unemployment- especially in the areas in which <span class="highlight">women</span> work- and so many <span class="highlight">women</span> being out of jobs, mean that the family income has been cut in half. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have been witnessing the arrival on our shores of the technological revolution, particularly now in communications and information processing, and the accelerating replacement of men and <span class="highlight">women</span> with machines and integrated circuits at a hitherto undreamed of pace and scale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that in future the debate on drug abuse in Australia will be more rational and will be conducted more by reasonable men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who look at the facts and at the possibilities of control of abuse in a sensible way rather than just consider the two alternatives of prohibition and complete libertarianism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not without significance that there is a correlation between the increase in juvenile unemployment since the mid 1960s and the increase in the number of married <span class="highlight">women</span> entering the work force over the same period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem cannot be solved by discriminating against married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force, as some have suggested but rather by implementing the Government’s financial measures which will recognise the economic worth of the homemaker and contribute to family support programs, thus reversing the economic discrimination now experienced by single income families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The union to which I belong currently is undertaking a major survey of membership to see what the reaction would be to governmental policies designed to eliminate the discrimination that is currently being experienced by full-time homemakers, to see whether that would be sufficient attraction for <span class="highlight">women</span> with dependent children to enable them to do their most important work, that is, the nurturing of their children, the future citizens of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to previous surveys that were conducted by at least one other union, the majority of married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force are there through economic circumstance, whether socially created want or need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not agree with the suggestion that there should be discrimination against married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there should be a true freedom of choice but not by virtue of the fact that there are not sufficient supportive policies of the Government to provide that true freedom of choice for married <span class="highlight">women</span> with dependent children, to take the economic pressure off them and to enable them to become full-time homemakers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Furthermore, thousands upon thousands of young married <span class="highlight">women</span> want to leave the work force and start a family, but they cannot do so because of housing finance problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>6469 would be a discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span>, as rebates are paid for vasectomy and prostate operations for males. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Reports emanating from a group of ambassadors, including an Australian ambassador, who visited Timor recently at the request of the Indonesian Government indicate that it appeared that the Timorese resistance has now succumbed to the Indonesian forces and that survivors, including innocent <span class="highlight">women</span> and children, were dying of starvation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my opinion worst hit are young <span class="highlight">women</span> residing outside the metropolitan area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If those young men and I suppose the young <span class="highlight">women</span> with whom she was living in the house were to turn her out onto the street because she was not bringing in any income, what would happen to her? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Cannot honourable senators hear the Prime Minister, the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and field officers of the Department of Social Security running around the countryside labelling every young person who happens to live in a communal situation as living in a de facto relationship, inferring that young <span class="highlight">women</span> are living in sin, that they are going to bed with every Tom, Dick and Harry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the other hand, Victoria is not committed to <span class="highlight">women</span>’s centres and in fact does not fund any. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the people of New South Wales look at the Leichhardt and Liverpool <span class="highlight">women</span>’s centres, for instance, and decide that that is how they want their money spent that is fair enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, when the Commonwealth has a special commitment, as it does have in the area of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s shelters, I believe that the whole aspect changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has gone about its work in a quiet fashion and, according to the people who operate it, if it were funded on the same lines as the Hobart <span class="highlight">women</span>’s shelter, it could expand and take in a number of <span class="highlight">women</span> who are requiring this service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most of us who have been interested in <span class="highlight">women</span>’s shelters have been careful to keep them out of the limelight as much as possible, to keep the publicity level low. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In this way the <span class="highlight">women</span> who go there can indeed be protected and sheltered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The difficulties arose in this case because some photographs were allegedly taken at the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s shelter in Hobart- photographs allegedly showing behaviour which was not very proper in such a place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">women</span> who conducted the shelter admitted that something had gone on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who went to Edmonton and all men and <span class="highlight">women</span> and boys and girls who go into amateur sport not only devote their time but also go to a lot of personal expense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This myth can be exploded and will be exploded when we as a nation realise that when we expect men and <span class="highlight">women</span> to go overseas to represent Australia in either the Olympic Games or the Commonwealth Games we have a responsibility to ensure that they are not victimised and that they do not suffer any hardships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we as an Australian people are not prepared to make the facilities available to them, are not prepared to fund these sporting bodies, why blame the sports men and <span class="highlight">women</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They must be given that assistance here before they go so that they are able to compete with other sporting bodies or other sports men and <span class="highlight">women</span> in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As honourable senators will be aware, the Homeless Persons Assistance Act was introduced in December 1974 on the basis of a report by a working party on homeless men and <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The working party on homeless men and <span class="highlight">women</span> recommended amongst other things, that capital grants totalling up to $5m a year should be made available over a three-year period to voluntary agencies and local statutory authorities for approved projects- such as night shelters, reception and assessment centres, hostels, flats, day centres, special clinics and detoxification units- in order to upgrade and replace existing inadequate accommodation and to build new facilities for permanently and chronically homeless men and <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has no doubt about the importance of this program or its effectiveness in helping to upgrade the standard of facilities for homeless men and <span class="highlight">women</span> in many areas of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complementary to the assistance that has been provided under this program, 76 <span class="highlight">women</span> ‘s refuges have been approved for funding, at an estimated cost of some $3m this financial year, through the Community Health Program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is in line with the spirit of the report of the working party on homeless men and <span class="highlight">women</span>, which recognised the need for consultation concerning the continued development of service by all levels of government and voluntary agencies to meet the needs of homeless people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These groups include <span class="highlight">women</span> who need protection in shelters, the increasing numbers of young homeless people as job opportunities decrease and as society’s problems become difficult with increasing unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many areas, including homeless <span class="highlight">women</span> and children, and girls in need of protection, could well come under such a program but have not done so in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Grimes  has said, this Act was introduced in December 1974 by his party when it was in government as a result of a report by a working party on homeless men and <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government has a special commitment to homeless persons, not only under this Act but also, as I mentioned last week, in respect of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s shelters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem embraces young people, people with acute psychological problems, and many more of the people now concerned than previously are <span class="highlight">women</span> and children and many are Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many middle-aged men and <span class="highlight">women</span> now find it impossible to get work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the credit of Australian Liberals belong the following firsts: National old age pension system; arbitration system; tariff protection of local industries; federal railway system; compensation legislation; Commonwealth involvement in education; votes for <span class="highlight">women</span> and 18-year-olds; free compulsory and secular education; the free Press; the secret ballot; the opening of our land to free settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, where the law is basically made by men, how easy it is to pass legislation about <span class="highlight">women</span>’s issues that are not worth a tinker’s curse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We waste public time, for instance, abusing the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuge movement instead of recognising and supporting its potential to undertake a social task the value of which is beyond measure and which cannot be fulfilled by traditional welfare bodies no matter how well intentioned they may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the final analysis we mere men and <span class="highlight">women</span> can do no more than our best making way for others if our best is not good enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It covered <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges, child care centresone could go on- and involved people in the community in looking after young children, with the Government topping up only one- fifth of the cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next I refer to the growth in the employment of married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no objection to married <span class="highlight">women</span> working but believe that our policies should not actively encourage married <span class="highlight">women</span>, especially if they have young children, to work at low wage rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fair enough if married <span class="highlight">women</span> can earn wages high enough to pay for child minding services and such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That might be acceptable, but I think it is wrong for government policies to encourage married <span class="highlight">women</span> to go out to work at the bare minimum wage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Did the Minister for Home Affairs advise the National <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Advisory Council that he was considering legislation to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex and marital status; if so, will the legislation apply to the Australian Capital Territory and the Commonwealth Public Service only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did indicate at the first meeting of the National <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Advisory Council on 10 August 1978 that I have a special interest in the means by which the law can be used to improve <span class="highlight">women</span>’s status and officers from my department have been considering, with officers from the AttorneyGeneral’s Department, the possible form of Commonwealth legislation to proscribe discrimination on the grounds of sex and marital status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not at present considered possible under the Constitution to extend such legislation to the whole of Australia, although persons (particularly <span class="highlight">women</span>) who live in States which do not have such legislation will not have legal guarantees against discrimination on these grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> are now to be found in this category, whereas previously it was confined to men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is in line with the spirit of the report of the working party on homeless men and <span class="highlight">women</span>, which recognised the need for all levels of government to participate in a program to assist the homeless and give recognition to the services that have already been established and are being run effectively by voluntary organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that at present <span class="highlight">women</span> are more predominantly homeless or that they are seeking help in greater numbers than at any other time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  draw attention to the community health program under which <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges are funded through the Department of Health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal will also affect some <span class="highlight">women</span> in the community who sometimes find that the only income or personal money they receive is the family allowance payment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these <span class="highlight">women</span> or poor families are to be deprived of these payments in part or whole by this proposal it is an unjust measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Grimes  has done a lot of worthwhile work on how this decision will affect individual families and what the realities of income reduction will be, but I suggest with the greatest of respect to him that he would make a more worthwhile contribution to the debate, and certainly one which would have more relevance to the <span class="highlight">women</span> of Australia, if he recognised that the mother’s allowance is to be penalised because of the child ‘s income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have seen so many young Aboriginal men in particular and <span class="highlight">women</span> as well who have lifted their heads above the crowd, have taken responsibility and have started to raise their voices on behalf of their own people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The award for young people in their first job is far too close to the adult rate and employers naturally choose experienced people, often middle aged <span class="highlight">women</span> re-entering the work force, in preference to juniors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a locally elected senator- a representative of this community- I am very much aware of the long delays in attending to very urgent matters, such as processing housing applications, processing applications for emergency housing for homeless families, processing applications for emergency welfare assistance from <span class="highlight">women</span> who have been deserted or from homeless youth or any other person in urgent need of assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a failure on the part of officers of the Minister’s Department to consult with the local police and hospital staff on this very urgent issue and no <span class="highlight">women</span>’s groups have been invited to participate in discussion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me be the first to state quite unequivocalbly that there should not be discrimination against married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would have meant that <span class="highlight">women</span> would have had to work under the same conditions, lifting the same weights and working in the same dirt as men, to get equal pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A famous Frenchman said recently that liberation of <span class="highlight">women</span> is freedom to choose between managing their homes and working in an office or factory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Employment and Industrial Relations in his speech on 14 September recognised that the influx of married <span class="highlight">women</span> seeking employment which was to some extent linked with the high level of migrant intake has been a factor of the labour supply from the 1950s onwards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope I am not so stupid as to believe that these men and <span class="highlight">women</span> did not achieve public office without some sense of concern and dedication. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While it is about it the Government might also recollect that it has a duty to Australian businessmen and <span class="highlight">women</span>, thousands of whom have gone to the wall in bankruptcy over the last couple of years, a duty which I suggest the Government has been neglecting most seriously and for far too long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  still thinks he is controlling inflation I suggest he go and talk to some Australian businessmen and <span class="highlight">women</span> as I have done recently- to a great number of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While  Senator Ryan  is fighting hard for the minority of <span class="highlight">women</span>, the majority of <span class="highlight">women</span> (and not only those in her electorate) are hoping for a better deal for single-income families so that they will not have to leave their families and seek work outside the home for economic reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Canberra branch of the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Action Alliance (a national body of concerned <span class="highlight">women</span>) sent a questionnaire to all ACT election candidates, seeking their views on indexation of family allowances . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Tonight he discussed the position of married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that there are married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force because they need the money for various reasons, such as to bring up their families and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say, too, that there are in the work force married <span class="highlight">women</span> who do not need to be there at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the Minister has made a block fund allocation to the States for child care services in <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will she consider allocating money directly to the Canberra <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuge for child care purposes, or will funds be allocated to that refuge for that purpose from the funds allocated to New South Wales for child care purposes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact that I have made grants to State governments and the Northern Territory as a contribution towards facilities for child care in <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last night I received a deputation from  Mr Fry,  representing the interests of the Canberra <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time I advise the Senate that I will make a grant of $2,000 for some capital facilities at the Canberra <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most members of this House will recognise that I do not normally speak on what could be described as <span class="highlight">women</span>’s issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, I have said many times here and in other places that there are no <span class="highlight">women</span> ‘s issues, and I would like to see the time when there are only people ‘s issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> have been particularly hard hit by this Budget and many will suffer considerable distress as a direct result of the Government’s priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general terms, I believe we can expect higher unemployment among <span class="highlight">women</span>, decreased spending power, especially among lower income families, reduced services, and hardship arising from the decision to index pensions only once yearly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Cuts in community health program spending will mean drastically reduced services by <span class="highlight">women</span>’s health centres and refuges, despite increased demands and increased costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wrote to the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  because I found that this refuge is existing mainly for the support of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">women</span> who find themselves in rather delicate domestic circumstances and require some form of home in which to live until government agencies can take up their plight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I received from the Emmaus <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Refuge a letter which states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We approached DAA because we had so many Aboriginal <span class="highlight">women</span> and children staying with us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of Social Security (Office of Child Care) again funds are not available for the actual running costs of <span class="highlight">women</span> ‘s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that you will be able to take up our case, as we are very concerned about the plight of the <span class="highlight">women</span> who live at Emmaus as a result of homelessness- and who are again facing the prospect of further homelessness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the heading ‘Emmaus <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Refuge- Operation’, it states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Emmaus <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Refuge has been operating from its current address at 2 1 Glendower Street, North Perth for four months (since 15 May 1978). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the other address was unsatisfactory only because the building was not big enough to cater for all of the families that needed the support of a <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One month was also spent in looking for a more appropriate site for a <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As with all other <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges in WA the basis of funding is- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the <span class="highlight">women</span> who work on the roster can only give their time as their contribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As most of the roster <span class="highlight">women</span> receive income from elsewhere (e.g. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tertiary Allowance, Supporting Mothers’ Benefit) it is impossible for roster <span class="highlight">women</span> to sign for wages and thus lose their own income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some roster <span class="highlight">women</span> do receive some money for their services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Emmaus <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Refuge provides emergency accommodation for homeless <span class="highlight">women</span> and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However Aboriginal <span class="highlight">women</span> often have a great deal of difficulty in finding alternative accommodation, and tend to stay at Emmaus longer than white <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">women</span> who come to Emmaus, have been housed by the State Housing Commission in the past- and have arrears on their previous tenancy which must be cleared before the Commission will consider re-housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This situation applies to each of the three <span class="highlight">women</span> and their twelve children currently residing at Emmaus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a further eight days when the proportion of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">women</span> and children has been at least 80 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the four month period, we have had 37 white <span class="highlight">women</span> and children who stayed 191 days, 34 Aboriginal <span class="highlight">women</span> and children who stayed 1 70 days in total. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have already said, cuts in community health program spending will mean drastic reduction in the number of services provided by <span class="highlight">women</span>’s health centres and refuges despite increased demand and costs, and the figures are there to prove not only increased costs but also increased demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an increase in demand for <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges because in the past there has never been an opportunity to provide services somewhere where, in a rather disastrous domestic situation, <span class="highlight">women</span> could suddenly gopacking, if necessary, in the middle of the night and taking themselves and their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that there are married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force because they need money for various reasons, such as to bring up their families and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say too that there are in the work force married <span class="highlight">women</span> who do not need to be there at all; some of them work in industry out of sheer boredom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that if we look at statistics we will see that when some of these <span class="highlight">women</span> who are confined to the house feel emotionally insecure in the house they become one or all of those things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it is rather improper for  Senator Kilgariff  to use the floor of this chamber to denigrate the <span class="highlight">women</span> who are in the work force and who are contributing to the economic stability of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We heard evidence that <span class="highlight">women</span> were taking as many as 20 to 40 compound analgesics a day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">women</span> are responding to that advertisement, which is a disaster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us see what he had to say when he opened the ‘sharing of the work’ conference which was organised by people well connected with the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Electoral Lobby in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This civilisation and the trade union movement spent years getting kids out of the mines and out of the factories and releasing <span class="highlight">women</span> from being pressured to go out to work because of need, and here we have the modern ideas of  Mr Macphee,  the person who is going to represent this Government at the vital conference which is being called by the Victorian Premier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people who created this problem during the late 1960s- Ian Macphee, as a representative of the employers, was one of them- were arguing against equal pay and were urging the <span class="highlight">women</span>, the mothers, to go out into the work force as a source of cheap labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate will recall Sarah Dowse as the head of the Office of <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, it was clear from a parable that she was acting not as a public servant but as part of the apparatus of the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Electoral Lobby and other radical feminist groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I get on to anything else let me tell the Senate who was appointed as Director of the Office of <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Affairs when Ian Macphee took charge of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I were a Minister I would be looking at all matters concerning <span class="highlight">women</span> that came before me as advice because the Office of <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Affairs vets everything that goes to the Ministers when it concerns the <span class="highlight">women</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am standing here on behalf of the vast majority of <span class="highlight">women</span> in this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will not be in the efforts of the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Electoral Lobby which, for example, asked the victimless crimes inquiry in Tasmania that all laws on victimless crimes, including those on homosexuality, prostitution, incest and abortion, be abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>proved that so far as a national organisation of <span class="highlight">women</span> in this country is concerned  Senator Ryan  was opposed to the indexation of family allowances and that she had replied to it in respect of that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She said: I did not answer that questionnaire that was sent to me by the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Action Alliance’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have in my hand a Press statement dated Thursday, 8 December 1977 by the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Action Alliance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an important <span class="highlight">women</span>’s organisation Indeed, it is an organisation which - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Action Alliance, yes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Harradine  brought forward as evidence for his views a letter from the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Action Alliance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We then got a burst on the giant conspiracy theory which involves the radical feminists of the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Electoral Lobby taking over the Government in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That makes it very difficult to take on in any detail the sorts of things that  Senator Harradine  talked about this evening in relation to <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that  Senator Harradine  is the senator who most frequently raises the subject of <span class="highlight">women</span> in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise tonight simply to get a couple of things on the record so that if  Senator Harradine  is going to pursue his arguments in relation to the role of <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australia, perhaps we might be able to get that debate on to some reasonable bases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the way that  Senator Harradine  approaches the subject of debate on <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is headed ‘The dark ages of <span class="highlight">women</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an article on a book entitled  The Years of Grace,  published a couple of decades ago, which gave some advice to young <span class="highlight">women</span> on how they ought to grow up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> these days are entitled to choose their own path in life just as men have been for some time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> are now starting to be released from those constraints. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It amazes me, for example, that he is unaware that the concepts of job satisfaction, automation, dehumanisation and the social implications that flow from them in the industrial arena have been discovered in modern research and technology to have strong parallels with some of the traditional social problems of <span class="highlight">women</span> in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They enable a family to have the right sort of economic independence so that <span class="highlight">women</span> who choose to make a career of being a full time wife and mother are in a position to do so and are not pushed out into the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, while we recognise that, it would be as iniquitous as pushing mothers out into the work force to push all <span class="highlight">women</span> back into the kitchen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was fascinated to hear him quote from a questionnaire which had been circulated by the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Action Alliance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have answered questionnaires from the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Electoral Lobby, the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Action Alliance and many other groups who issue questionnaires, usually at the time of an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, I recall that during the 1 975 general election campaign I answered a questionnaire for the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Electoral Lobby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was slightly surprised to find that on the subject of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s rights I ranked below my Queensland colleague,  Senator Glen  Sheil and others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Women</span> ‘s Action Alliance has never made available to me my score on any basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things that I find particularly sad about this aspect is that the <span class="highlight">women</span> in the community who are attempting to organise themselves politically do so from a certain disadvantage compared with most men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do it from the disadvantage that it is only fairly recently that <span class="highlight">women</span> have become aware of the fact that they have political muscle and that through organising themselves in <span class="highlight">women</span>’s groups they can exercise that muscle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very sad to see these <span class="highlight">women</span>’s groups exploited by male politicians who are well practised in the art of exploitation of community groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I only hope that these <span class="highlight">women</span>’s groups will learn in time that by allowing themselves to be open to such exploitation they destroy their credibility and the credibility of a point of view which may be perfectly legitimate and which they wish to put in relation to <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately on the subject of <span class="highlight">women</span> he is completely one-eyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he were to come into this place and put forward his theory on what Australian <span class="highlight">women</span> ought to be doing and what their opportunities ought to be I would be delighted to debate it with him on that basis, but I serve notice on him that if he embarks on the sort of attack that he made tonight he will be involved in long debates on the adjournment in which his speech will be analysed in a way which <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Council has therefore recommended that (a) in future intrauterine diagnostic procedures should comprise a part of genetic counselling services and should be intergrated with those services in each State and Territory; (b) laboratory facilities should be expanded to allow genetic diagnostic services to be offered to all pregnant <span class="highlight">women</span> in the 35-39 age group and (c) because of the complexity of the procedures, amniocentesis in early pregnancy and foetoscopy should only be performed by obstetricians associated with the State co-ordinated intrauterine diagnostic and genetic counselling services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was pointed out in the discussion paper on paying for health care that was put out in February this year by Doctor Sax that the main increase in institutional care was the increase in nurses ‘ salaries- a catch up in wages for <span class="highlight">women</span> with which I entirely agree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I see the wisdom of years, and I pray to God that I also see men and <span class="highlight">women</span> of principle: men and <span class="highlight">women</span> of vision, men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who are not the mere minions of government and bureaucracy, but men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who are now prepared to stand up and be counted, and are in tune with the song of freedom that is presently resounding throughout this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In  1973  the Labor Government extended eligibility for war service loans to regular servicemen and <span class="highlight">women</span> after a minimum of three years’ service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This clause proposes the introduction of a preference system for those servicemen and <span class="highlight">women</span> who have had war service and provides, for the first time in the history of the defence service homes scheme, specific authority for imposing a waiting period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When one considers that about one-third of a million exservicemen and <span class="highlight">women</span> have taken advantage of this scheme as part compensation for their sacrifices that were made in the defence of this country, one would imagine that it would be one of the areas in which there would be no attempt made to introduce legislation which would reduce concessions to such people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely there are many men or <span class="highlight">women</span> overseas with sufficient status who, given the necessary economic incentive, would take on such a responsible and worthwhile job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was typical of the loyalty of those men and <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On one occasion a government official spoke glibly of the little social consequence of the closure since in his mind most of the men could obtain jobs and a high proportion of the <span class="highlight">women</span> were married. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can talk about the commitments of the husband and wife, the single <span class="highlight">women</span> and all those people who are part of the manufacturing industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The three areas that are covered in the report are: Firstly, immigration, which has occurred very substantially since 1945; secondly, the influx of married <span class="highlight">women</span> seeking and finding employment within the work force; and thirdly, the fluctuations in the proportion and number of young people who are entering the labour market, accompanied by a trend towards longer average periods of full-time education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, married <span class="highlight">women</span> accounted for over 80 per cent of the escalation in the labour force growth rate due to the addition of females. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position in regard to married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force had changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force had increased from 6.7 per cent to 11.1 per cent, and in 1971 it was 6.9 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, this demonstrates the very significant contribution that married <span class="highlight">women</span> made to the work force during that period from the early 1 950s to the present day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very largely, that significant characteristic of the labour force over the last 20 years has had a considerable influence on the changes in the needs of the labour market insofar as married <span class="highlight">women</span> have found jobs in areas which had not previously been available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of the remainder, there are three main recommendations: Firstly, that private free-standing abortion clinics should not operate in the Australian Capital Territory; secondly, that there should be a clinic, conducted by the Capital Territory Health Commission, within the grounds of a public hospital, to perform abortions authorised by law up to 11 weeks of pregnancy; and thirdly, that all <span class="highlight">women</span> having abortions performed in the Australian Capital Territory after 1 1 weeks and up to 20 weeks of pregnancy should be in-patients in a public hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The designating of facilities- for example, the setting aside of some portion of the building as a clinic in which counselling and termination of pregnancies may take place in the first 1 1 weeks of pregnancyand the provision of in-patient care for <span class="highlight">women</span> between the 11th and 20th week of pregnancy are matters for the Capital Territory Health Commission acting under its own Ordinance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a fact which is inescapable and, as between <span class="highlight">women</span> seeking an abortion in Sydney and <span class="highlight">women</span> seeking an abortion in Canberra, there is a discrepancy, a discrimination, which is important and which I believe would have been important in the deliberations of the Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do take the view, which I believe is strongly supported by circumstantial evidence, by facts and by the history of the abortion debate over many years, that, whatever this Senate does in relation to legislative proscription regarding abortion, abortions will still be sought by <span class="highlight">women</span> and will still take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The significant point that I seek to make from the law as it has been and still is in most legislative prescriptions is that, however we might like to characterise abortion, the fact of the matter is that many <span class="highlight">women</span> who are confronted with a difficult moral and social problem do not see it in that way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alternatively, do we make the judgment perhaps that we live in a society in which there is insufficient room for legitimate choice to be made by <span class="highlight">women</span> confronted with this situation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it appalling that the people who take the anti-abortion line can seriously believe that <span class="highlight">women</span> have abortions for cosmetic reasons, that <span class="highlight">women</span> take abortions lightly, that they have them for no serious reason but just for their own convenience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They take no responsibility for the poverty, the drudgery, the violence, the hunger, the illness, the despair, the lack of hope and the pain that <span class="highlight">women</span> have to suffer in these circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because they do nothing about the problems that cause <span class="highlight">women</span> to have an abortion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since the committee will not even see the <span class="highlight">women</span> concerned under any circumstances there is no question of it actually counselling her. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would be a respectable point of view, but I think that on such a massive moral issue, an issue which affects something like a quarter of a million Australian <span class="highlight">women</span> a year, those <span class="highlight">women</span> are entitled to hear the views of their elected senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that abortion is abhorrent to all men and <span class="highlight">women</span> of goodwill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the noble philosophy that I have espoused that abortion is abhorrent to all men and <span class="highlight">women</span> of goodwill for the reason that I have given is viable only in a perfect society- and God knows we do not live in a perfect society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my knowledge, very few men are ever faced with the dilemma of whether they should have an abortion but <span class="highlight">women</span> are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The terrible choice is with <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without going into the morality of that situation, I think one can conclude at least one thing, and that is that there is massive sexual ignorance in Australia today by both men and <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That a multi-lingual pamphlet setting out all aspects covered in the counselling session shall be provided to all <span class="highlight">women</span> at the conclusion of the counselling session. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What moral right has a senator from Tasmania to determine the moral standards of Canberra and in particular whether the <span class="highlight">women</span> of Canberra should or should not be able to see contraceptives advertised in chemists’ windows? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This issue surely affects the rights of the <span class="highlight">women</span> of the Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The majority of <span class="highlight">women</span> have perfectly normal births and the scans are not a necessary part of treatment in a normal pregnancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would interpret from that that  Senator Walters  is against <span class="highlight">women</span> having automatic ultra-sound scans, because she explained later just how expensive it is going to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation and the whole issue that we are talking about do not mean that we are insisting that all <span class="highlight">women</span> have to have an abortion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes the reasons are purely and simply that <span class="highlight">women</span> recognise that they cannot give the necessary emotional support either to a child or to another child in their family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some <span class="highlight">women</span> are so emotionally drained that they know that they cannot cater for the needs of a child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did it on the basis that many years ago I recognised notonly that <span class="highlight">women</span> have a right to determine what they should do with their bodies but also that there was a consideration for the unborn child to be taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those of us who do not adopt the same view as those liberals on this occasion do so on the basis that the decision of the woman- a painful and difficult decision, which it must be for so many <span class="highlight">women</span>- is a decision which affects not only that woman alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We speak as people who have been closest to pregnant <span class="highlight">women</span>, who have had to face these problems and who have had to make some decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My belief, and I put it simply, is that I would want to ensure for all Australian <span class="highlight">women</span> the widest possible access to all the facilities they need if they wish to have a lawful termination of pregnancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ordinance narrows the potential access of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the Australian Capital Territory to termination of pregnancy when they are legally entitled to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> from the Australian Capital Territory certainly do use free-standing abortion clinics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the fivehour bus ride from Canberra to Sydney indicates the hypocrisy that can come into this debate if we say that by excluding free-standing clinics we will in fact be stopping all <span class="highlight">women</span> in the Territory from using them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may interest honourable senators to know that of the first 1 ,007 <span class="highlight">women</span> who were treated at the Preterm Foundation the percentage that came from the Australian Capital Territory- 3.9 per cent- was exactly the percentage which the population of the Territory would represent if it were included in the population of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happens to the rest of the <span class="highlight">women</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hypocrisy to pretend that failure to establish a clinic here will result in <span class="highlight">women</span> not using this facility or not continuing to desire to have abortions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the fact that it will mean delays in routine gynaecological surgery, what will it mean for the <span class="highlight">women</span> desiring termination? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the extra committee, I think, is just to make abortion less accessible to <span class="highlight">women</span> in Canberra than it is in other parts of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is not a State which as a rule for all <span class="highlight">women</span> insists upon the imposition of a terminations committee between a woman and the doctors who certify her to need the termination and the procedure itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My concern is to decide what effects this can produce for the <span class="highlight">women</span> of the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The barriers are there and this is at a time when all the evidence shows that the procedure is becoming more common round Australia and when the Legislative Assembly tells us that each year more than 400 <span class="highlight">women</span> in the Territory will require a termination of pregnancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a doctor I have had to counsel many pregnant <span class="highlight">women</span>, some of whom with my help have been able to find support to go through their pregnancies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had to counsel many pregnant <span class="highlight">women</span> who with my support have found their way to termination of their pregnancies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I find the possibility of less easy access to abortion for <span class="highlight">women</span> in the Australian Capital Territory to be present if this Ordinance is upheld. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be less easy access that is likely to be socially inequitable in its impact and which is likely merely to direct <span class="highlight">women</span> to Sydney and to the free standing clinics there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dr HUGHES: Well, could you put an approximate percentage on the number of <span class="highlight">women</span> who would be given a pelvic examination by a doctor before the final decision was made that they would have an abortion and that they would go into the operating theatre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ms HOOKS: From the point of view of sterility the doctors eat and drink and smoke in the theatre at the same time as <span class="highlight">women</span> are being operated on and thats certainly not sterile procedure by any means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>like things that are not sterile, the cloths that are used to wipe the <span class="highlight">women</span> down afterwards, and sometimes they use the same cloths to wipe down all the <span class="highlight">women</span> for one day and thats certainly not sterile and if that comes in contact with any of the instruments or anything - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He commenced his remarks by saying that he was a medical practitioner, that there are a couple of medical practitioners in the Senate and that they were close to the pregnant <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The husbands of the pregnant <span class="highlight">women</span> are pretty close to them, but I cannot see what that has got to do with any of the argument to and fro across the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To read the letters one would imagine that the effect of  Senator Ryan’s  motion would be to terminate the pregnancies of all Australian <span class="highlight">women</span> forever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it has the support of a majority of the people and specifically, I suggest, of the <span class="highlight">women</span> of the Australian Capital Territory and of the elected representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, and perhaps the most important of all, it is an action which, if supported, will give <span class="highlight">women</span> even greater freedom for it is an extension of <span class="highlight">women</span> ‘s rights to have control over their own bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the right to legally solve an issue that faces most <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sixty per cent of the opinions came from <span class="highlight">women</span>- and that in itself, I think, is significant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They came from <span class="highlight">women</span>’s organisations, doctors, nurses, lawyers, social workers and, of course, mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of those in favour, 55 per cent saw such laws as giving <span class="highlight">women</span> ‘freedom to decide one’s self or as ‘enhancing <span class="highlight">women</span>’s personal choice’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These responses were to a completely open-ended question and showed the concern of the majority of people in the Australian Capital Territory to give <span class="highlight">women</span> greater freedom and control over their own lives and bodies and futures- a right which they should exercise themselves and which the law should protect and guarantee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A second survey, predominantly of adult <span class="highlight">women</span>, was carried out in 5 1 Canberra suburbs and responses were obtained from 713 people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was assisted also by the surveys, which show that there is considerable public opinion that the right of <span class="highlight">women</span> to terminate a pregnancy at a government clinic should be legally established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever the number is, each one represents a personal decision that has had to be made by individual <span class="highlight">women</span> throughout the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It matters not whether the number is 5,000, 50,000 or 200,000; each one represents a decision that has had to be made by <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not decisions which the <span class="highlight">women</span> concerned have taken lightly; they are not decisions that doctors have taken lightly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The plain fact of the matter is that <span class="highlight">women</span> do not make those sorts of decisions care-free and without regard to their responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a male I can say only that a tremendous responsibility rests with those <span class="highlight">women</span> who are forced to make these sorts of decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears that  Senator Harradine  has no conception of the need for <span class="highlight">women</span> to be given help when making decisions about whether to proceed with a pregnancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we support, as I believe many honourable senators in this chamber say they support, the principle of freedom of choice, then we ought to give to the <span class="highlight">women</span> of the Australian Capital Territory freedom of choice in relation to these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a clear cut plan to establish a clinic at which one-third of those <span class="highlight">women</span> who become pregnant can have their pregnancies terminated instead of using different methods as they are now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if <span class="highlight">women</span> are of that belief, then I emphasise that I believe that such an abortion should be conducted under the strictest supervision and in a public institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How could I not agree given that <span class="highlight">women</span> in other parts of Australia have such a facility available to them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that desperate <span class="highlight">women</span> and girls will travel, for example, to Sydney or to Melbourne for this operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also know that some <span class="highlight">women</span> who need abortions will not be able to afford the fares to travel or that some <span class="highlight">women</span>, having no one to leave their families with for a couple of days, will be forced to go through with a pregnancy that will damage their health and the welfare of their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everybody here knows that through the ages thousands of <span class="highlight">women</span> have died as a result of backyard abortions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without such provisions, a number of <span class="highlight">women</span> with needed skills and experiences would be lost to the public sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proper maternity leave provisions ensure that <span class="highlight">women</span>, in whom the Government has made a considerable investment in terms of training and development of expertise are afforded employment protection by being able to continue in Commonwealth employment while also raising a family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For <span class="highlight">women</span> who do not resume duty following maternity leave, the sick leave entitlement under the existing provisions becomes a ‘retirement benefit’ not available to other employees on resignation or retirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although access to sick leave will become dependent on the production of a medical certificate, <span class="highlight">women</span> on maternity leave will still be able to draw on their accrued recreation and long service leave credits during the unpaid period of their maternity leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer also to the evenhanded approach of the chairmen, or perhaps chairpersons since some of the chairmen are <span class="highlight">women</span>, for the way in which they allow the Government and Opposition members- in fact, all members of the Committee- to put their questions and then assist them in getting the answers for which they are looking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I asked the officer in charge- I want it to be understood right now that in no way am I blaming the personnel of the ABS; they are operating under the instructions of the Government and we were told that, in the main, these random sample tests are carried out by middle-aged married <span class="highlight">women</span> who they claim have certain expertise- did the ABS ever recruit for their surveys any of the people whom they found to be unemployed and single people, I was told that the ABS would sooner have people with a certain expertise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why are they not recruited, instead of middle-aged married <span class="highlight">women</span>, to do this work? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If its experience is that <span class="highlight">women</span> of the type described in the Estimates committee do provide the service which is required by the Bureau, I think it would be an extremely odd thing if the Government intervened and told the Bureau that it should use these people to find pockets of unemployment that could be relieved and to get rid of its existing staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Administrative Services  (Senator Chaney)  will remember that some concern has been expressed in some Navy circles in New South Wales about a suggestion that a considerable number of men were billeted in huts while it was claimed members of the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Royal Australian Navy Service had far better quarters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that we have managed to salvage as a result of repeated representations to the Minister have been about six jobs for <span class="highlight">women</span> stewardesses who supposedly were to have been retrenched when the Tasman Passenger Service was taken off the run. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations: What plans are there for the continued funding of National Employment and Training scheme programs directed at retraining unemployed <span class="highlight">women</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As you know, it has a majority of Aboriginal men and <span class="highlight">women</span>, all of whom play a prominent part in directing and advising our small staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether he is aware of the present requirement of the Australian Passport Office that married <span class="highlight">women</span>, when applying for a passport, provide evidence of change of name, usually in the form of a marriage certificate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Late last year <span class="highlight">women</span> of the Timorese community in Melbourne, which is the only one with which I personally am familiar, were beginning to ask what was happening about that undertaking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Melbourne there are <span class="highlight">women</span> with a number of children and no father, the father being in East Timor; and there are brothers and sisters under 12 years of age, with no parents here at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know what validity there is in threats and so on; but a number of Timorese <span class="highlight">women</span> in Melbourne have said that if they are not reunited with their families by Christmas this year they will go on a hunger strike until they are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The two main components of unemployment are young people and <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A second development in the last ten years has been that more married <span class="highlight">women</span> have entered the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sixty-five per cent of the <span class="highlight">women</span> working in those stores would prefer to work only two or three days a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that could happen it would create thousands of part time jobs for other <span class="highlight">women</span>, but with the casual rates currently applicable it is not possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It represents bad faith to <span class="highlight">women</span> because the effect of the reductions in maternity leave, as I will point out later on, will be to force many <span class="highlight">women</span> out of the Public Service into unemployment, permanently it would appear at the moment because it is almost impossible to get back into the Public Service once one has retired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This demonstrates the bad faith of the Government with respect to equality of opportunity for <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government were worried about abuse and about <span class="highlight">women</span> joining the Public Service simply to get maternity leave and things of that kind it could have introduced a fairer compromise, such as a pro rata qualifying period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, it means that the Government’s commitment to equality of opportunity for <span class="highlight">women</span> is qualified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government really believes that <span class="highlight">women</span> should not be penalised in their employment for child bearing, why does it propose that there be a 12-month qualifying period? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in the present circumstances I cannot support the removal of automatic entitlement to sick leave to <span class="highlight">women</span> who are on maternity leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real difficulty for <span class="highlight">women</span> going on maternity leave but who want and need to return to work within the qualifying period is the lack of proper child care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not the situation and, as a result of the lack of child care facilities and, now, the necessity for a woman to be really ill before she can use up her sick leave credits as well, we will see <span class="highlight">women</span> returning to the work force, because they need to hold their jobs, before they are properly fit to do so, or have been able to make really satisfactory arrangements for their small babies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  said in his policy speech last year that the Government was committed to complete equality of opportunity for <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> make up 36 per cent of the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two-thirds of those <span class="highlight">women</span>, or one in five workers, are married. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the proposed restriction on maternity leave, and the abolition of paternity leave, will have the effect of forcing some men and <span class="highlight">women</span> out of the work force, out of permanent employment in the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">women</span> cannot find satisfactory child care or do not feel that they can return to work in the time now allotted, or if they have joined the Public Service too late to qualify for maternity leave, I think that many of them will have to resign from the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is unacceptable, especially at a time when it is so difficult to gain entry to the Public Service and does deny the policy of equality of opportunity of <span class="highlight">women</span> that was announced by the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United Nations declaration on the elimination of discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span> states that maternity leave is essential to protect <span class="highlight">women</span> from discrimination on the grounds of marriage or pregnancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1911 the International Labor Organisation has recognised the right of <span class="highlight">women</span> to maternity leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been much talk of abuses and of <span class="highlight">women</span> never coming back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surveys show that 50 per cent of <span class="highlight">women</span> do return to work after maternity leave despite the enormous difficulties of obtaining child care for children under 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The figures have been produced in a report by an Australian Government Joint Council sub-committee entitled ‘Survey of <span class="highlight">women</span> returning to work after maternity leave’ to which I shall refer later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well over 12 months ago through the device of placing questions on notice I sought to obtain information about who was returning to work, the number of <span class="highlight">women</span> who were taking maternity leave, how often they were taking it and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, I do not think that there are many cases of <span class="highlight">women</span> who are actually making a career of producing children so as to qualify for maternity leave year after year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The claim has also been made that <span class="highlight">women</span> are joining the Public Service when they are already pregnant just to qualify for maternity leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The survey to which I referred established that in the year 1976-77 only 80 <span class="highlight">women</span> had been pregnant when they joined the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have also been many complaints, and in a sense they are genuine complaints, about the personnel and staffing problems which arise when <span class="highlight">women</span> are on maternity leave because they are tying up jobs and cannot be replaced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very sympathetic towards people in management and personnel areas who have to cope with the problem of <span class="highlight">women</span> who are absent on maternity leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason is not that <span class="highlight">women</span> are taking the leave to which they are entitled; the reason is the staff ceilings policy of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government had a more flexible staffing policy with regard to the Public Service those <span class="highlight">women</span> absent on maternity leave could be replaced just as other employees on sick leave, recreation leave, study leave, long service leave or any other form of leave available to all public servants are replaced or should be replaced temporarily by other officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that <span class="highlight">women</span> taking maternity leave have become the scapegoats for the situation that has been created by the Government’s policy of restrictive and - unrealistically low staff ceilings for the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It found, for example, that only 2.7 per cent of <span class="highlight">women</span> who took maternity leave had less than one year’s service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It found that 88.8 per cent had between two and 10 years of service; that 8.3 per cent had 10 or more years of service; that 82.7 per cent of <span class="highlight">women</span> surveyed had not previously taken maternity leave; that 16 per cent had taken maternity leave once before and that 1.3 percent had taken maternity leave twice before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maternity leave cost S6.1m last year, making a total provision of some $7m for public servants which would have assisted greatly in gaining equality of opportunity for <span class="highlight">women</span> public servants and assisted greatly in supporting the families of Commonwealth employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I must stress that it is grossly unfair that only public servants can get what all working <span class="highlight">women</span> should have, and that is paid maternity leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note that the Government, which is so fond of talking abouts rights for <span class="highlight">women</span> and support for families, has not supported the ACTU case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means, of course, that many <span class="highlight">women</span> return to full time employment that they cannot really cope with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no provisions for easier entry into the work force for <span class="highlight">women</span> who stay out of the work force until their children are of school age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was when the barrier on the continued permanent employment of <span class="highlight">women</span> after marriage and on the appointment of married <span class="highlight">women</span> as permanent officers was removed from the Public Service Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They enabled <span class="highlight">women</span> officers who became pregnant to take leave of absence without pay for a period not exceeding 26 weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Ryan has said that the alterations to this Act demonstrate bad faith on the part of the Government- bad faith to families, bad faith to <span class="highlight">women</span> and bad faith to public servants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I contend that the only bad faith that they establish is bad faith to the abusers of the system, because there is no doubt that the maternity leave provisions were introduced to assist <span class="highlight">women</span> to stay in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Less than 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">women</span> availing themselves of maternity leave have returned to the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part of that discussion paper reads:   the Act is seen as providing a disincentive to changes in patterns of parental responsibility between men and <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It goes on to say that it is not necessary that only <span class="highlight">women</span> should be eligible to care for the baby and that such a restriction serves only ‘to institutionalise the role of woman as child-rearer and to reinforce stereotyped views’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of that I will be accused of being against <span class="highlight">women</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Ryan  must surely agree that the figures show that the majority of <span class="highlight">women</span> want to look after their own baby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The majority of <span class="highlight">women</span> have decided that they want to look after their own babies and the figures that I have prove it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures for 1975-76, which are the latest figures that the Bureau of Statistics can give us, show that 57 per cent of <span class="highlight">women</span>- not 50 per cent, but 57 per cent- resigned in the same year that they took their maternity leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of the <span class="highlight">women</span> taking the maximum leave of 49 to 52 weeks, 66 per cent resigned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in the beginning maternity leave was brought in specifically to assist <span class="highlight">women</span> to return to the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said a moment ago, and  Senator Ryan  was obviously not listening, the majority of <span class="highlight">women</span> are resigning because they want to look after their new babies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Ryan  said, in 1976-77 there were employed by the Commonwealth Public Service 80 <span class="highlight">women</span> who were pregnant when they went into the Service and who immediately took their maternity leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder how many of those <span class="highlight">women</span> have since resigned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that 57 per cent resign anyway, so obviously at least 57 per cent of those 80 <span class="highlight">women</span> resigned as soon as they had taken their maternity leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, this Government has bad faith with the abusers of the system but it has not bad faith with the family, with the <span class="highlight">women</span> of this society or with the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be borne in mind that it is the <span class="highlight">women</span> especially who take the initiative in keeping in touch with the family and in planning the trip. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that the advertising should not antagonise <span class="highlight">women</span>- for example it should avoid anything which might reinforce Australia’s reputation as a beer-swilling, male-orientated society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But what I am saying is that there is an enormous range of forms of industrial action of the kind in which trade unions and their members have always engaged and will always engage from time to time so long as this is necessary to protect the interests of the working men and <span class="highlight">women</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-86-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the present high level of youth unemployment, is the Minister aware of any evidence that highlights the apparent preference of employers for young and middle-aged <span class="highlight">women</span> over school leavers, especially male school leavers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the same time, the rates of participation in the labour force of <span class="highlight">women</span> aged 25 to 44 rose very sharply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In response to  Senator Teague  ‘s question, I point out that we have a situation in which young and middle-aged <span class="highlight">women</span>, particularly those aged 25 to 44, have in considerable numbers chosen to enter the work force or to remain in the work force longer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This exercise by <span class="highlight">women</span> of their freedom of choice, which I freely acknowledge, has had the effect of limiting further the opportunities and choices available to school leavers and people under 20 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other factors have encouraged employers to take up middle-aged <span class="highlight">women</span> in greater numbers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the eyes of employers, married <span class="highlight">women</span> in particular appear to be more stable and mature employees and to stay longer in their chosen jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part of the problem, and this is rather basic to my argument, is that planning by authoritarian States has been arbitrary and has almost always been imposed downwards without any attempt to consult the community or those business men and <span class="highlight">women</span> and workers who must inevitably be affected by that planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We believe that most problems can be solved by a reasonable consensus between intelligent men and <span class="highlight">women</span> and that if we give that away in this world we have nothing left. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should pay tribute to that considerable group of men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who, throughout the year and almost around the clock, negotiate on behalf of Australia as well as other nations at a wide range of conferences, seminars and meetings in which the highest standard of intelligence, negotiation and diplomatic effort is called for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Six hundred million men, <span class="highlight">women</span> and children living in absolute poverty without access to the basic amenities which we take for granted is, of course, a very frightening situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These articles, instead of reporting what actually had been said to the Committee, under sensationalised headlines such as ‘Maintenance for <span class="highlight">Women</span> Must go’, selected complaints made by members of the public to the Attorney-General and then represented them as being endorsed by the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those reports were in fact blamed for an event in Melbourne whereby a group called the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Revolutionary Guerilla Army threw a brick through the Attorney-General’s office window. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> in particular are concerned because they feelwith justification- that the Act takes away any protection they may have had under the old divorce laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, 30 of them said that men were being prejudiced under this Act and about 30 people said that <span class="highlight">women</span> were being prejudiced under this Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Over 43 per cent of all married <span class="highlight">women</span> are in the paid work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But that freedom of choice is not available to the vast number of married <span class="highlight">women</span> with dependent children who are forced into the work force through the economic circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why not consider the lifting of family allowances and the payment of a realistic homemakers allowance which would relieve the economic pressure and provide an opportunity for thousands of married <span class="highlight">women</span> to leave the paid work force? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has been estimated that if only  9  per cent of the married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force responded to this opportunity there would be no teenage unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well as giving married <span class="highlight">women</span> a true freedom of choice, my suggestion would do something for the population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thereby real jobs will be created, not artificial jobs, not the palliatives which have been suggested such as the sharing of jobs, the reduction of hours of work, of getting married <span class="highlight">women</span> out of the work force and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This has resulted in an increased use of technology and the displacement of men and <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest we need more than attempts- like the one suggested by  Senator Harradine-  to take 9 per cent or so of the married <span class="highlight">women</span> out of the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not want to be taken the wrong way by any means when speaking on this subject but we have to look at the number of married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1933, 54,800 <span class="highlight">women</span> were employed in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That number represented 2.04 per cent of the married <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1975 the number of married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force increased quite considerably. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that people today, receiving the wages that they do, are better off by far than were people employed in the pre-Depression years when only 4.2 per cent of <span class="highlight">women</span> were in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Her  explanation of the problem revolved very much around her discovery of a number of social phenomena which have happened in Australian society in the last 30 years such as the increased employment of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Walters  quite properly pointed out earlier, this is due to some large measure to the entry into the work force of keen, reliable <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the early 1970s, wages, especially those for <span class="highlight">women</span>, increased sharply, partly as a result of the introduction of equal pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we sit back with complacency at the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea because we are justifiably horrified at the excesses of the Pol Pot regime, if we ignore the excesses of the Shah of Iran because he was pro- Western and then ignore the excesses of the Ayatollah Khomeini because he is allegedly anti-Marxist and ignore what his sort of religion will do to the <span class="highlight">women</span> of that country and to the basic freedoms of people in that country, or if we remain silent about East Timor for fear of offending the Indonesians, we have no international standing and no right to be heard in international forums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that is a very big question that ought to be considered, bearing in mind that 60 years is the age at which the pension is payable to <span class="highlight">women</span> and that 65 years is the age at which the age pension is payable to men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Voluntary organisations in the Territory- for example the <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Refuge, the Smith Family and the St Vincent de Paul Society- are strained well beyond their resources in trying to cope and give some assistance with the social problems which have followed upon the Fraser Government’s economic strategy for the national capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Government aware of the results of two studies recently released by the Colorado State University and the Miami University’s School of Public Health which show that over six years miscarriages among <span class="highlight">women</span> in the Oregon town of Alsea rose to the unprecedented rate of 130 per thousand live births in June of each year, just after surrounding forests were sprayed with 2,4,5-T, and that this figure represents almost three times the miscarriage rate in two control areas where miscarriages averaged 45 and 46 per thousand? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the  Medical Journal of Australia  of September 1977 it was shown that there had been a continuing downward trend in smoking among men and a continued increase in smoking among <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the other hand, the 1974 survey showed that only 29 per cent of <span class="highlight">women</span> smoked, but by 1976 that figure had increased to 31 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Department or the Government is concerned that there are these marriages of convenience, and that <span class="highlight">women</span> will come here, drop their husbands and go off into other areas of Australia, surely it would not be beyond the wit of the Department to devise some sort of scheme of length of time that the couple must stay together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Whitlam Labor Government did it, firstly, by recognising the important part being played by voluntary organisations in providing recreational outlets for the Australian people; secondly, by providing capital grants for the construction of sporting community recreation and cultural facilities; thirdly, by assisting Australian sports men and <span class="highlight">women</span>; fourthly, by stimulating an awareness of the benefits of individual fitness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As happens in Queensland from time to time, the police overreacted to the situation and, possibly stimulated by the peculiar attitude of the Special Branch in that State, took action against this small group of men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who, in any other State, would not have been considered to be breaking the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In proposing that amendment the Labor movement is saying that it accepts the concept of a security system within the internal operation of Australia but that until such time as the matters that are suggested in our amendment become embodied in the legislation and become part and parcel of the charter by which the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation conducts its affairs any government, particularly this Government, will find it hard to sell the concept of an Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to the ordinary man and woman in the Australian community- men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who believe that they have a right to say what they want to say, to do what they want to do and to think what they want to think without necessarily being subjected to the spying and Sprying that go on in what is or might become a police state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that in this letter the Victorian Refuge Group states that the original and continued funding of the refuge program was for more than emergency accommodation for <span class="highlight">women</span> and children at risk, and that in an attachment to the letter the refuge group declares that <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges are ‘primarily concerned with the status of <span class="highlight">women</span> in society and not with providing welfare and health services’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me that just as there are views in the community that change with the nature of society and that there are individuals in the community who are more or less receptive to changing attitudes, so there are judges, eminent men and <span class="highlight">women</span> as they may be, who, at the age of 65 years and over, are likely to be less sensitive to what the community regards, in a number of matters, as politically subversive or political undesirable and are therefore likely to attract an adverse security assessment- a view that might not be shared by a person appointed to the bench at a considerably younger age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-On 4 April 1979,  Senator Walters  asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Health, a question without notice  (Hansard,  page 1270) concerning an advertisement by the Hobart <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Refuge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Tasmanian Department of Social Welfare, which has immediate responsibility for supervision of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges in that State and through which Commonwealth funds are channelled, has expressed the view that this advertisement was not discriminatory since it stated that ‘a feminist principle would merely be an advantage ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The primary objective of such an advertisement should be to obtain the services of a person best qualified to care for <span class="highlight">women</span> and children in crisis situations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, the Department of Health will be requesting the Tasmanian Department of Social Welfare to advise the Hobart <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Refuge that, for the reasons stated above, future advertisements should contain no such statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-On 10 May 1979,  Senator Harradine  asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Health, a further question  (Hansard,  pages 1797 and 8) concerning an advertisement appearing in the  Age  for the Victorian Western Region <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Refuge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A letter purporting to have been forwarded by an organisation known as the Victorian <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Refuge Group was received in the Department of Health on 3 May 1 979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government made available $1 million in 1977-78 and $3 million in the current financial year for <span class="highlight">women</span> ‘s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) How many Australian servicemen or <span class="highlight">women</span> in the Australian Army, Navy and Royal Australian Air Force were cither: (a) injured seriously enough to require hospitalisation: or(b) killed, in each year from 1967-1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The need for guaranteed, continued and adequate Federal Government funding for <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of this chamber and those of another place who had the advantage of talking to representatives of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges throughout Australia who visited Canberra last week will recognise some of the problems that they are experiencing now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">women</span> who were in Canberra last week informed us that 75 per cent of that funding comes from the Federal Government and 25 per cent is normally paid by the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not paid in Queensland, as we know from questions which were raised in this place as long ago as 1976 and 1977, when the Federal Government paid to Queensland an amount for the maintenance of two <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government then, quite rightly, took the position that it would directly fund <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Western Australia the situation now is that the State Government has reneged on its commitment to the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has now determined that as from a provisional date, 1 November 1978, <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges will receive only 12’/i per cent from the State Government, in addition to the 75 per cent Commonwealth funding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps she is not aware that State governments and local governments actually contribute to worthwhile community organisations such as <span class="highlight">women</span> ‘s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So Western Australia has the distinction along with Queensland, of being the only State which does not contribute the entire 25 per cent to <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the metropolitan area of Perth we have eight refuges which are specifically designated as <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges, but I intend to show in figures which I will produce later that those refuges are used more for children than they are for <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of them are overtaxed powerwise- I was about to say …..powerwise’ but as we are referring to <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges it would be totally incorrect to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I want to make honourable senators aware now of the numbers of people who use or require the services of refuges- as I said, they are misnamed ‘<span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges’- in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that sufficient shock will be expressed for those people who are concerned to make sure that when the Budget talks are being held additional, guaranteed, adequate and continued funding are provided for <span class="highlight">women</span> ‘s refuges throughout the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable senators that 1979 is the International Year of the Child and that children are requiring the use of those refuges as much as <span class="highlight">women</span> are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At one stage in Nardine the ratio of children to <span class="highlight">women</span> has 4.1:1, which I think is quite horrific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, whilst accommodation was found at <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges for a total of 1,163 <span class="highlight">women</span> and children over a four-month period more than that number, or a total of 1,383 people, were turned away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is not one refuge that would not be able to tell members of this place absolutely heartbreaking stories about <span class="highlight">women</span> with children who arrive in the middle of the night in battered physical condition and emotionally broken who are looking for some comfort, perhaps just a cup of tea and a shoulder to cry on to enable them to assess the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The assistance given to <span class="highlight">women</span> is another service that the refuges provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People who have used the refuge know that there are <span class="highlight">women</span> at the refuge who care for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They receive the emotional assistance that is needed when a <span class="highlight">women</span> with her children are suddenly turned loose on society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it takes a great deal of courage for <span class="highlight">women</span> with family responsibilities suddenly to walk out of the matrimonial home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">women</span> could walk out for a number of reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have seen <span class="highlight">women</span> who have had their teeth broken, who have had bruises around their face and shoulders and possibly over their bodies, whose children have been battered and been taken to a refuge because it is a refuge for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Possibly because of its geographic situation in the metropolitan area it found itself catering for the needs of a great number of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">women</span> with their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other agencies take Aboriginal <span class="highlight">women</span> and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But one generally finds that people of that ethnic background will in actual fact gravitate to where they know there are other <span class="highlight">women</span> who understand their specific problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it will not be any easier for Aboriginal <span class="highlight">women</span> to move out of a refuge into emergency housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, they cannot do so if <span class="highlight">women</span> are taking up bed days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is certainly not being utilised for emergency housing for <span class="highlight">women</span> in drastic situations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a bit unfortunate that <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges have been an area of little public awareness and therefore easily swept under the carpet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is promulgated by such worthy organisations as the  Daily News  which in an article last Friday week, 18 May, twice referred to <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges as ‘<span class="highlight">women</span>’s Refugees’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not terribly sure whether this newspaper is suggesting that <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges are to cater for the needs of <span class="highlight">women</span> refugees who happen to come from some other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I had hoped that I would be able to reply to criticism that was expressed by  Senator Harradine  and  Senator Walters  about the Tasmanian <span class="highlight">women</span>’s shelter, but I will leave the reply to that to either  Senator Melzer  or  Senator Robertson,  if they have time to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The letter from the Richmond <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Emergency Service in Lismore is dated 1 5 April and states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since we commenced operating we have had a very great demand for our service and at any one time we would average six <span class="highlight">women</span> and fifteen children accommodated at the refuge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is outright discrimination by real estate agents who prefer to rent to ‘families’ rather than single <span class="highlight">women</span> with children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Would you please ask questions ‘without notice’ and ‘with notice’ in the house highlighting the problems of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges in general and ours in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can assure those <span class="highlight">women</span> in Lismore that I am aware of their needs and that when I am in New South Wales I will visit them, if possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this Parliament questions have been asked and statements have been made by  Senator Harradine  and  Senator Walters  in which they were very critical of the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s shelter in Tasmania because of an advertisement that it had placed in a newspaper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an urgent need for guaranteed, continued and adequate Federal Government funding for <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has moved a matter of urgency with regard to the funding of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges, and I think that a number of matters can be discussed during this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1974, the then Minister for Health approved the first <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuge for funding under the Community Health Program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The funding of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges under that program was regarded as an interim measure pending a final decision as to the appropriate source of funding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the change of government took place at the end of 1975, a total of 19 <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges in the States were approved under the Community Health Program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 1977-78 Budget, the Cabinet decided that the funding of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges should be continued under the Community Health Program and the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  announced that in that year, in addition to the funds required for the continuation of the 19 refuges previously funded, Sim would be made available for the funding of refuges which had not been approved previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1978-79 the Government provided $3m for the funding of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps I ought to put the record in order by saying that when the Commonwealth’s funding of additional <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges resumed in 1977-78, it was at the same rates as the funding of general community health projects, that is, 50 per cent of capital costs and 75 per cent of operating costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this financial year, the Commonwealth’s funding of general community health projects has been at the rate of 50 per cent for capital and operating costs, but it ought to be noted that funding of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges has been maintained at 50 per cent of capital costs and 75 per cent of operating costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This could be regarded as an important recognition of the need for assistance to <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges, and the bulk of the expenditure in this year is in relation to operating costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are significant in the development of the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges program and the full funding in those four States, which comes by way of Federal and State government funding, I am sure has been of very great assistance in the establishment of the projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with the arrangements which were introduced in 1976-77, the Commonwealth’s funding of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges under the Community Health Program is by way of block grants to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In each financial year the Minister for Health approves a block grant to each State for that State’s total program of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Coleman referred to the Emmaus <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuge in Perth and spoke of the difficulties with regard to it and the numbers of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">women</span> who use it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that there have been difficulties with regard to the future of the Emmaus <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuge and I am told that on the recommendation of the State Department of Public Health it was approved for Community Health Program funding in 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been said, it caters largely for Aboriginal <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently, the staff of the refuge have had great difficulty in maintaining effective supervision of the <span class="highlight">women</span> and children and it seems that these problems resulted in the Theosophical Society notifying the organisation that its tenure had been withdrawn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would expect that, in the period leading up to the Budget discussions, he would be putting forward his proposals with regard to the further development of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges in several parts of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The motion of urgency referred to the need for guaranteed, continued and adequate Federal Government funding for <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This shows that the Government recognises the need for <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges, recognises with alarm- as I think  Senator Coleman  put it- the increasing need for provision of such refuges in order to help people who are in distress, in danger or in terror, as well as children who are subjected to what is widelyspread abuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The week before last, when representatives of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges throughout Australia were in Canberra, I was able to see them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am hopeful that it will lead to improved care of children and greater relief for mothers and the staff of the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because I am not in a position to make commitments prior to the announcement by the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  of projects which are to be approved in respect of a particular year, I have no other remarks to make with regard to the funding of <span class="highlight">women</span> ‘s refuges, or the urgency motion that has been brought forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as far as <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges are concerned, their increased development and the continuing and growing support that has been given to them by the Federal Government would lead everyone to understand that the Government recognises the need for them and that it must provide substantial funds to continue their existence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  says that the Government recognises the need for <span class="highlight">women</span> ‘s refuges and has shown its concern by the commitment that it has made, but in view of the promises that have already been broken by this Government, notably with regard to the reduction of income tax and the retention of Medibank, we are worried that its concern about the need for refuges may also go out the window. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only last week the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  admitted that unemployment would not disappear; that it could reach the figure of 550,000 by next February; and that increasing unemployment was one cause of the pressure which prompts people to react in a violent way and results in <span class="highlight">women</span> needing refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators know that people react violently and cruelly, and that <span class="highlight">women</span> and children are not in a position to protect themselves against that sort of behaviour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even there, refuges that have accommodation for small groups of, say, six to eight <span class="highlight">women</span> with their children and which deal with people for short periods, have been accommodating up to 74 people over the last six months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people at all the refuges say that they have received calls for help from three times that number of <span class="highlight">women</span> during the last six months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have to advise <span class="highlight">women</span> on their legal rights, their rights to pensions and allowances, what they can do about housing and schools and what they must do about the care of their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people have to develop skills of lobbying to attract funds from government departments, both for the <span class="highlight">women</span> who use their refuges and for the refuges themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So they have to become skilful in using what people might call political skills to service the areas and the <span class="highlight">women</span> in the areas in which they work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every day of their lives these people are immersed in the gross injustice and inequality of all the <span class="highlight">women</span> who either approach them for assistance or who live in those refuges for short periods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They become very concerned at the injustice and the inequality that is meted out to so many of those <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the <span class="highlight">women</span> who use the refuges and who work in them become concerned with changing society so that the problem does not exist any more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The accusation has been made that the <span class="highlight">women</span> who run or use the refuges are lesbians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These refuges are for <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are run by <span class="highlight">women</span> because <span class="highlight">women</span> in trouble or despair find other <span class="highlight">women</span> more understanding and more supportive of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because they are all <span class="highlight">women</span> in those houses does not mean that they are lesbians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because, a group consists of all <span class="highlight">women</span>, it does not mean that those <span class="highlight">women</span> are in any way sexually different from the ordinary <span class="highlight">women</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one is to say that groups of all <span class="highlight">women</span> contain lesbians, one would have to say that groups of all men contain homosexuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no <span class="highlight">women</span> sitting in the House of Representatives but I do not believe that the men in that House are homosexuals because of that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is as absurd to say that they are homosexuals as it is to say that because groups of <span class="highlight">women</span> are living in houses together those <span class="highlight">women</span> are lesbians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unfair to <span class="highlight">women</span> in States such as Queensland and Western Australia that they do not have at least the resources that States such as Victoria and South Australia have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, in Victoria the refuges are used by the police to dump <span class="highlight">women</span> but the Police Department does not assist with the funding of the refuges and it does not assist with keeping the refuges safe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has already clearly indicated its support of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s shelters in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Melzer  made the extraordinary comment that the Minister had said that the Government does not have the money to fund <span class="highlight">women</span>’s shelters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at the Government’s funding of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s shelters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not reduced the Commonwealth’s share of funding of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges as has been done in other health programs to the 50-50 share basis on both capital and operating costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The follow-up work entails obtaining information about the welfare benefits which it is the right of these <span class="highlight">women</span> to receive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many <span class="highlight">women</span> do not know that welfare agencies exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">women</span> who run the shelters accompany their clients to lawyers and doctors and generate a tremendous amount of support after the initial crisis in the follow-up period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All this is of great assistance as the figures show that the majority of <span class="highlight">women</span> return to their home environment after the initial crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the shelters, and particularly the ones that I know of in Tasmania, have half-way houses and other forms of housing to which these <span class="highlight">women</span> can go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have entered another area in Tasmania which I believe to be crucial- that of alcoholic <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the suspension of the sitting I was talking about special shelters for alcoholic <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently in my State Caroline House was established as a centre for alcoholic <span class="highlight">women</span> in crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other shelters cannot take alcoholic <span class="highlight">women</span> because they do not have sufficient area in which to set them aside from the other <span class="highlight">women</span> and assist them with their particular problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Put a man and a <span class="highlight">women</span> together and 1 8 years later you may have a soldier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am further advised that no <span class="highlight">women</span> were included in the survey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  left Australia on 1 June to attend the International Conference of <span class="highlight">Women</span> Leaders in Israel and to take up activities associated with the International Year of the Child in the course of visits to Europe and the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> who have the pills prescribed by their doctors or by family planning clinics will be given a warning leaflet with the pills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, this Government has set out to see that ordinary men and <span class="highlight">women</span> have less wages, less food, less education, less health and, in the long run, of course, less security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the other area of the work force which the Government blames for the position we are in is that of married <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that that sort of philosophy was brought into play in the report presented this week on the forgotten work force- the migrant <span class="highlight">women</span> who are slaving away in garages and workshops. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where is the Government ‘s policy for those sorts of <span class="highlight">women</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told that if married <span class="highlight">women</span> get out of the work force there will be jobs for kids. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that men and <span class="highlight">women</span> are governed by inexorable events beyond their control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In speaking to the Bill, I want to highlight the problems that <span class="highlight">women</span> in the Commonwealth Public Service will face if the Bill is passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am moved to raise the matter because this Government, in varying ways, seems to me to have already decided that <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force are a liability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Cabinet have already said that <span class="highlight">women</span> caused inflation because of their insistence on equal pay and because of the equal pay decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been declared that <span class="highlight">women</span> have been causing wastage through the use of this provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this Bill, the Government will be able either to cut out maternity leave and therefore make it impossible for married <span class="highlight">women</span> to have a career in the Public Service and at the same time have children or to redeploy or retire <span class="highlight">women</span> because of their need for maternity leave or because they may need maternity leave, in much the same way as Ansett Airlines of Australia refused a woman the right to train as a pilot, even though she had all the qualifications, because she may need leave to have a baby and she may have a baby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They probably disapprove of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the Public Service, except perhaps to make the tea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first of these is the policy which many organisations adopt of dismissing <span class="highlight">women</span> when they become pregnant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second is that of dismissing <span class="highlight">women</span> who are married in the event of staff layoff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission ruled on maternity leave it must have given hope and incentive to a lot of <span class="highlight">women</span> who want a career other than the career of being a wife, homemaker and mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s whole attitude to <span class="highlight">women</span> and <span class="highlight">women</span> workers is a worry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already there have been statements by Ministers, including Cabinet members, to the effect that <span class="highlight">women</span> have taken over jobs that men and young people should have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs,  Mr Viner,  gave the National Economic forum a detailed description of the effect <span class="highlight">women</span> have had on Australia’s workforce since the early ’60s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Between 1964 and the late ’70s, while the number of men working rose by 25 per cent, the number of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the workforce increased by about 70 percent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The percentage of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the workforce rose from 23 per cent in 1 964 to 36 per cent in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Viner said the increased number of married <span class="highlight">women</span> working must have ‘weakened the imperative for the traditional bread winner to remain in, or take to employment’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a broadcast on a radio station in Melbourne this year,  Mr Eric  Robinson was quoted as suggesting that married <span class="highlight">women</span> were responsible for much unemployment among males. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did say that there were now in the work force many more <span class="highlight">women</span> than there had been some years ago and that the structure of the work force had changed completely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I went on to say that some jobs which normally would have been available to males were now occupied by <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course,  Mr Hunt  hit really dizzying heights in the debate on abortion when he claimed that <span class="highlight">women</span> having abortions were causing unemployment because they were reducing the number of consumers we produce, thus depressing the manufacturing industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is indicative of the approach that this Government, particularly, its Ministers, is taking to <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>’; ‘Married men deserve preference because they are the breadwinner’; ‘Deserted wives deserve preference over single people or young people’; ‘People will lose their jobs by victimisation, so cannot be expected to lodge a complaint’; ‘You are telling <span class="highlight">women</span> to work and this causes marriage breakdown’; ‘Training costs so much, men should get preference because <span class="highlight">women</span> leave the workforce to get married’; ‘We can’t promote <span class="highlight">women</span> because they are not dedicated like men’; ‘Men are not as sensitive as <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> add a human face to business’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of those remarks can be developed into areas that would give <span class="highlight">women</span> in the Public Service cause for great alarm as to where their futures lie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can see people giving married men preference, and I can see the situation arising where deserted wives have preference over single <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Almost twothirds of all unemployed <span class="highlight">women</span> are in clerical service or in sales occupations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has put forward no job creating plans to replace these jobs and thus to give these <span class="highlight">women</span> jobs in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a decision is made to retrench excess personnel in certain areas, under the provisions of this Bill it will mean that an increasing number of <span class="highlight">women</span> will be put on to the unemployment list. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that redeploying married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the Public Service can cause insurmountable problems for their families and for them in relation to their personal relationships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in relation to that aspect that <span class="highlight">women</span> are in an extraordinarily vulnerable situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can see <span class="highlight">women</span> in the Public Service taking the brunt of the provisions of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could wipe out <span class="highlight">women</span> as employees of the Commonwealth Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of those people, and I would point out that the majority of them are <span class="highlight">women</span>, will be de-skilled by new technology which the Government is introducing into the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the union’s big problems, especially in sections where there were a lot of <span class="highlight">women</span>- exactly the same sort of problem exists in the Public Service- was to get people to act as honorary trade union officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a start, put 1 ,000 unemployed men and <span class="highlight">women</span> on to it, pay them the $300m we would save by cancelling one of the three already obsolete patrol frigates we are about to order from uncle sam for $900m (with planes) and let us enjoy a superb hot-shot inter-capital service while we are awaiting the next war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There must be hundreds and hundreds of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the community who are trained hairdressers because that was the only area in which <span class="highlight">women</span> could get any sort of apprenticeship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Old people die from cancer more often than young people; men have a higher cancer death rate than <span class="highlight">women</span>; and blacks a higher one than whites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In countries such as Nigeria, Jordan, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, <span class="highlight">women</span> do not get a vote at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so, how will this affect the thousands of other <span class="highlight">women</span> in this country who have been refused pensions for similar reasons? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Government concerned that, while in the United States precautions have been taken since 1970 to prevent pregnant <span class="highlight">women</span>, and <span class="highlight">women</span> of child-bearing age, making contact with this material, in Australia pregnant housewives can purchase the herbicides from supermarket shelves, with no warning of the physical damage which can result from excessive use of the chemical involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-86-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following a recommendation of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee at its meeting held on 24 February 1978, these leaflets are required to include a warning relating to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease that may be encountered by <span class="highlight">women</span> over 30 years of age, particularly those <span class="highlight">women</span> who smoke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-86-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it possible to establish the viability of employing <span class="highlight">women</span> as trainee technicians in the defence forces when last year there were only 7 <span class="highlight">women</span> employed compared with 4381 men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-86-58">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Why has the number of <span class="highlight">women</span> employed as trainee technicians in the defence forces fallen from 19 in I97S to 7 in 1978, while the number of men has increased from 3S98 to 438 1 during the same period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-86-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The objective was to bring young men and <span class="highlight">women</span> together to create understanding between people, to avoid fear, hatred, suspicion and war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the Launceston <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Shelter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When a <span class="highlight">women</span> has to go to one of these shelters it implies that she has nowhere else to go- no friends, no neighbour, not even a relative close enough to turn to or to trust in, or from whom she can find comfort and assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since this shelter was formed four years ago over 1 ,250 <span class="highlight">women</span> and children have had cause to use it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I am making is that these residents are more concerned for themselves than they are for these desperate <span class="highlight">women</span> who are seeking a refuge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If so, how will this affect the thousands of other <span class="highlight">women</span> in this country who have been refused pensions for similar reasons? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every year hundreds or thousands of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the community have their pensions taken away from them on the assertion of officers of the Department of Social Security that they are living in a de facto relationship with a man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Minister is in fact saying that <span class="highlight">women</span> who feel that they have been unjustly deprived of a pension under these circumstances will have to do what  Mrs Clarke  did, that is, take out a High Court writ, obtain legal aid if they are eligible to do so and threaten the Department in this regard in order to have such a decision changed- if the guidelines are to stay the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only other alternative is for the hundreds or thousands of <span class="highlight">women</span> in this community who are deprived of their pensions in these circumstances to take out High Court writs to get justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is important that this very difficult area- I admit that is is a difficult area- be cleared up so that justice can be done and be seen to be done for the many <span class="highlight">women</span> involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It showed that in Australia men were better off than <span class="highlight">women</span>, that 10 per cent of males got almost 20 per cent of all income received by males and that the corresponding 10 per cent of females received almost 32 per cent of such female income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These thousands of people on below average weekly wage, to use the term, along with family households and businessmen and <span class="highlight">women</span>, are being penalised while the oil, coal and mineral exploiters of our country generally continue to be allowed a free hand as they slip their dividends from many areas to tax-free havens around the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Men and <span class="highlight">women</span> throughout Australia who almost four hears ago saw Malcolm Fraser as the great white hope for this country have had their expectations dashed to the ground, basically I believe for two reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think of the story told to us by one witnessthis may have been repeated in the Senate before- of the child who would not believe there were such people as <span class="highlight">women</span> doctors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Also, does the Government intend to establish, and assist in the funding of, a committee representative of interested groups in the Australian community to undertake research and to publicise the second Special Session on Disarmament in 1980, along lines similar to those of committees established for the International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year and the International Year of the Child? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the recent slow-down in the rate of improvement of life expectancy, and half the difference in life expectancy between men and <span class="highlight">women</span>, can be attributed to the fatal effects of smoking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In all, an estimated 2 1,400 deaths in men and 3,750 in <span class="highlight">women</span> between the ages of 35 and 64 in 1974 were attributable to smoking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result of that can only be- if they succeed- that more and more people will die earlier than they need; that more babies will die young; that more work will be lost through illness; and worst of all, that men and <span class="highlight">women</span> will spend the last years of their lives as respiratory cripples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister also noted that in the Australian Broadcasting Commission, whilst the total number of <span class="highlight">women</span> employed is 1 ,884, only one is paid at a rate equivalent to that of a Second Division officer? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister agree that those figures evidence discrimination against <span class="highlight">women</span> occupying senior positions in the Public Service? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These new provisions are designed specifically to protect the job security, safety, health or welfare of Australian men and <span class="highlight">women</span> and their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will recall that in the first year of the Fraser Administration-  Senator Guilfoyle  would remember this- funding was made available for <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was taken by the Queensland Government and never given to <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is why this Government now funds <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges in Queensland directly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately today most Australian working men and <span class="highlight">women</span> are dependent on private cars to get to and from work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a non-partisan way and, if one likes, in an all-party way, those men and <span class="highlight">women</span> have decided that they should sit down in conference and examine this very farreaching piece of legislation, that they should have a formal meeting for this purpose for the first time in the history of industrial legislation in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We shall be lesser men and <span class="highlight">women</span> and of lesser use to the community as a whole if they become law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The introduction of the legislation in 1974 followed the 1 973 report of the Working Party on Homeless Men and <span class="highlight">Women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report’s recommendations highlighted the need to concentrate assistance on upgrading existing facilities for permanently and chronically homeless men and <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be noted also that the program is not directed exclusively towards chronically homeless men and there is a number of centres which cater exclusively for single homeless <span class="highlight">women</span>; some agencies in developing new hostels have taken the opportunity to provide accommodation for both men and <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When independent men and <span class="highlight">women</span> are prepared to do without Christmas holidays for years, to see their bank savings totally eroded, virtually to starve and to allow their children to suffer, surely we can say: Is there not a basic reason? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Bill does extend the program, but neither the Bill nor the second reading speech tell us very much about the future of the program, except that some youth refuges will be established under the Youth Services Program in the Office of Child Care, that some homeless people already receive support under the Community Health Program- that is, <span class="highlight">women</span>’s shelters, and they have done so for four or five years- and that other homeless people receive support from welfare housing and the Family Support Services Scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges ended up with the Community Health Program because of impatience with progress at the time- it was done when Labor was in officeand because more funds were available in that area is to be regretted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the program includes provision for a smaller group of homeless <span class="highlight">women</span> and that some youth refuges are to be continued, but from the second reading speech of the Minister for Social Security it seems that the activity is to be confined largely to the group of so-called homeless men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Page 2 of the Minister’s second reading speech shows that in total there are 113 centres approved at present and that these provide overnight accommodation for 3,600 men and <span class="highlight">women</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Georges  has pointed out that it is indicative of the thinking of this Government that it is prepared to allocate to those voluntary organisations only 25c by way of subsidy on the meals that these organisations provide to needy people and to homeless men and <span class="highlight">women</span> and only 75c towards the cost of a bed provided for these people at night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hate to think that those organisations might have to resort, as a lot of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges do, to lamington drives and the like simply in order to provide a service to the needy people of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I wrote the foreword to the booklet ‘A Place of Dignity’ I said that an estimated 10,000 homeless men and <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australia were being assisted by welfare agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people are mainly young men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who have found no employment opportunities in their own home-town centres where their parents reside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said in this place many times, a number of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges in Perth find that they have to cater for the needs of young <span class="highlight">women</span> who suddenly find themselves destitute and without a place to stay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also stated that many of the men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who would benefit from the improved services for the homeless were people who were receiving income security benefits at rates and under the conditions which had been liberalised since the end of 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as has been stated throughout the debate, the youth services program is one in which the States are working on a matching basis with the Commonwealth Government, and the community health program, under which <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges are funded, is another program where the States are working well with the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can see that the homeless persons program is an appropriate place in which to deal with the youth refuge program and the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuge program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The provisions in the Bill to which the Opposition has no objection are those which provide for twice-yearly indexation of pensions and benefits; those which provide an extension of income limits for pensioner fringe benefits; the extension of the wife’s pension to <span class="highlight">women</span> in approved benevolent homes; the extension of the wife’s pension to <span class="highlight">women</span> who are separated from their husbands because of illness or because they or their husbands are in benevolent homes; and the correction of the anomaly in the payment of family allowances and handicapped children’s allowances monthly which occurs when children are in institutions or away for a holiday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister agree that such a scheme has merit and might be a convenient way of eliminating the anomaly whereby men receive age pensions at 65 years and <span class="highlight">women</span> at 60 years, even though the life expectancy of a female is much greater than that of a male? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Hamer mentioned an anomaly with regard to the different age at which <span class="highlight">women</span> and men are entitled to receive pensions in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as raising the pensionable age for <span class="highlight">women</span> to 65 years is concerned, this is not a matter that is before the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among the <span class="highlight">women</span> to whom the benefit was granted was a woman whose husband was in a mental or benevolent home, who was a pensioner who had the custody, care and control of a child under the age of 16 years, or who had attained the age of 50 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In October 1979 the  Australian  reported of scuffles which broke out at the Salvation Army offices at Clayton as 500 men and <span class="highlight">women</span> lined up for vouchers worth some $30 to buy groceries and other items to feed their families because at that time they were not able to get the unemployment benefit as a result of a deliberate policy of the Government to delay payment of the unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Also, does the Government intend to establish, and assist in the funding of, a committee representative of interested groups in the Australian community to undertake research and to publicise the second Special Session on Disarmament in 1 980, along lines similar to those of committees established for the International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year and the International Year of the Child? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-71-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of International <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Year and the International Year of the Child, the international community required governments to promote national activities and it was appropriate for the Government to sponsor and to assist in funding committees established by Non-Governmental Organisations to support these two years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-71-5">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister for Social Security: Is it a fact, as reported in the Press, that she informed either  Mrs Pearl  Logan, the State  president  of the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s section of the Queensland branch of the National Country Party, or a <span class="highlight">women</span>’s committee of that party, that the Government was considering lifting from $6 to $20 a week the permissible income of a person receiving the unemployment benefit? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matters referred to by  Mrs Logan  were certainly not matters that were discussed with me; nor did I discuss them with any other member of the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s committee of the National Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Generally, we cannot say how much of our resources, our help or assistance gets to the wealthy who do not need it or how much gets to the professional middle men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who run the services and how much actually gets to clients in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-65">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, we believe that in order to achieve this the critical consideration is not a question of geographical balance sustained over time, or at any given point of time, in the composition of the Court, but rather the certainty that the best men and <span class="highlight">women</span> in the nation are appointed to the Court,, the best both in terms of their scholarly ability and technical expertise across the range of law with which they have to deal- especially constitutional law- and in terms of the kind of vision and breadth of understanding and approach that they bring to their job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The initiative came from American congresswomen who, like the people of Australia, had been extremely concerned and distressed by the reports of massive starvation and deprivation in Kampuchea itself and in the refugee camps. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was an initiative of congresswomen particularly I think arising from the <span class="highlight">women</span>’s caucus within the Congress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was hoped that a delegation of <span class="highlight">women</span>, perhaps because of its novelty, might have a particular impression on the Kampuchean authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> from legislatures all over the world were invited to join the delegation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we brought with us to the administration in Kampuchea messages of support for the exercise from all <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australian parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That has sparked a great deal of feeling and was very much the instrument in stirring the Congress <span class="highlight">women</span> to seek to visit the country and to carry the message that the world wants to help these people who are starving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report of the Office of <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Affairs and other reports outline the position in unorganised industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to know when <span class="highlight">women</span> are subjected to some of these indignities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another example is the married <span class="highlight">women</span> in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over 43 per cent of all married <span class="highlight">women</span> are in the paid work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many surveys have shown that most of those <span class="highlight">women</span> with dependent children have been forced into the work force by economic pressures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But why not in some way such as that give an opportunity to thousands of married <span class="highlight">women</span> who desire to come out of the paid work force to do so? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the first time in history, less than half of that $572m will actually go to <span class="highlight">women</span> whose husbands have died. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of the sole supporting parents receiving benefits, 57,067 are <span class="highlight">women</span> and 1,970 are men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Almost half the <span class="highlight">women</span> are unmarried, and 65 per cent of those <span class="highlight">women</span> have no other income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I see it, there is no stated Government policy, in these documents or elsewhere, which says that that is the aim, but the deliberate pressure, both in the past and at present, on married <span class="highlight">women</span> to enter the paid work force has helped to promote the trend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It concerns that non-controversial body, the National <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Advisory Council, which recently delivered its first report concerning the need for Commonwealth legislation to protect <span class="highlight">women</span> from domestic violence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The National <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Advisory Council has come under some criticism from very small minority groups in the community for its activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I would like to place on record my appreciation, and the appreciation of the Opposition, for the extremely competent and effective work by way of advising government on policies affecting <span class="highlight">women</span> that has been carried out by the National <span class="highlight">Women</span> ‘s Advisory Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would recommend to all honourable senators, particularly those who may be sympathetic to some of the criticisms made of the National <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Advisory Council, that they read this report and address themselves to the very thorough recommendations within the report covering a vast range of areas affecting <span class="highlight">women</span> in Australia in our time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I express the hope that at the earliest opportunity in the meeting of the Parliament after Christmas we will have before us sex discrimination legislation as outlined in the first annual report of the National <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Advisory Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Women</span> are a quarter of the workforce and in some sectors eight out often. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that many honourable senators who have read the survey carried out by the Centre for Urban Research and Action, that excellent document entitled ‘But I Wouldn’t Want My Wife to Work Here’, will have no problem in accepting that that sort of disadvantage exists, particularly for migrant <span class="highlight">women</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a quite scathing indictment of the attitude of some trade unions to migrant <span class="highlight">women</span>, particularly those who are process workers in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the severest critics of the lack of participation by migrant <span class="highlight">women</span> workers in the trade union movement, the most trenchant critics there, were in fact active trade unionists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 8 November 1979  (Hansard,  page 2047),  Senator Melzer  directed a question to me, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Health, concerning the addresses of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-127-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator’s question apparently relates to circumstances connected with the residential addresses of a small number of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges, all of which are located in Victoria and which are included in a total of 94 refuges funded under the Community Health Program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-127-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be noted that the Commonwealth Government strongly supports <span class="highlight">women</span> “s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-127-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidence of this support can be found in the growth in the number of <span class="highlight">women</span>’s refuges which has taken place during the Government’s term of office- from nineteen refuges at the end of 1975, to ninetyfour currently approved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-127-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister not agree that the security of Tasmania is of interest to the <span class="highlight">women</span> as well as to the men of my State? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Examples of these include: the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">Women</span>’s Centre in Darwin which received $30,000; the National Aboriginal Child Care Seminar which received $10,872; and thirty recreational and youth activity programs for Aboriginal children to be funded at $132,326. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Examples of these include some 28 projects for children ‘s centres child care services for migrant <span class="highlight">women</span> attending English classes, and an outside school hours project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Office of Youth Affairs is to develop a list of young men and <span class="highlight">women</span> who might be interested in and be suitable for appointment to such positions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-86">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-On 11 October 1979  (Hansard,  p. 1209)  Senator Douglas  McClelland asked me a question without notice concerning the employment of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the Australian Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that there are only 23 <span class="highlight">women</span> in the Second Division of the Australian Public Service reflects, in part, the fact that until late 1966 married <span class="highlight">women</span> were precluded from becoming officers in the Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another major influence on the participation of <span class="highlight">women</span> in senior levels in the Service is that the average length of service of female officers is significantly less than that of their male counterparts, reflecting in part the higher resignation rates of female officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1966, however, the representation of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the more senior levels of the Service (excluding the First Division) has increased markedly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in 1973 there were only two <span class="highlight">women</span> in the Second Division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The role of <span class="highlight">women</span> in the Australian Public Service and the removal of any discrimination are under constant attention by the Public Service Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that  Senator Coleman  and all other honourable senators will be delighted to learn that in fact there is no discrimination between <span class="highlight">women</span> and men veterans of the Australian forces and that all are entitled to the same benefits in the same circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Although this in a sense could be regarded as prejudice in favour of the <span class="highlight">women</span> rather than the men, at the same time one would have to acknowledge that this is a result of the many years of inequality between men and <span class="highlight">women</span> and the assumption that has always been made that the only breadwinner in a household is a man and not a woman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
