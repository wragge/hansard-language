  <li>
    <p>What are the names of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who have either had their passports refused or confiscated since1950 and what were the circumstances of each case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700407_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister for Immigration indicate what action has been taken to accelerate the processing of applications from Australian wives of non-Australian husbands who desire their offspring to be registered as <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> under clause 7 of the Citizenship Act 1969? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is the Leader of the Government aware that the United States of America is to allow persons from outside that country, including prominent <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and members of this Parliament, to go there and speak against the war in Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, in accordance with the findings of the Australian gallup poll, published in the Melbourne Herald’, 14th November 1969, the majority of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> want censorship either maintained or increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of the fact that what I said in my previous question may be a reflection on an overseas individual or an overseas airline, does he not consider the safety of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> to be sufficient cause to take immediate action to ensure that inexperienced personnel employed by overseas airlines do not land at any Australian airport? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister  representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs aware that a publication known as Polish Weekly’ which is edited in Melbourne has served <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> of Polish origin for 20 years and that the publication has its own editorial policy and carries advertising? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs: In view of last year’s incident when an Australian girl languished for a lengthy period in a prison cell in the Canary Islands before the Spanish authorities brought her to trial, and in view of a further current incident involving Miss Randall pf Sydney who has been in gaol in Italy for 6 months awaiting trial, what action is the Department of Foreign Affairs taking to obtain speedier trials for <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> abroad who face these predicaments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That they believe that the Aborigines in common with all other <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, have a right to assemble in any peaceful manner of their own choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst strongly condemning such damage irrespective of who caused it, I ask the Minister whether he can give the Senate any information about recent treatment of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> in Yugoslavia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration, ls the Minister aware of the concern that has been expressed and is being expressed by <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> that individuals with criminal records have been admitted to Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will mean that the Government is not willing to inquire into what has lead to a state of terrorism in Australia where innocent <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> may be injured in the streets of Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why has the Australian Government failed to adopt Convention 87 which should ensure the democratic rights of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister to consider this question and to verify that our authorities do have the right to intercede on behalf of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> in spite of the fact that those citizens may be claimed as nationals by another country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of bias shown against <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> holding valid Australian passports seeking to enter the United Kingdom by certain British immigration officials, will the Prime Minister obtain a guarantee from the British Prime Minister that incidents, such as that involving  Mr Taylor,  will not be repeated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Labor Government pose as being deeply concerned about the rights of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Special Minister of State: When, where and in what circumstances were the 3 <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> - Horvat, Keskic and Vlashnovic - arrested in Yugoslavia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> place great value on the sanctity of human life and the physical, mental and social welfare of mothers and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said that this is unacceptable, but it is unacceptable to this country that we should have supposed citizens of Australia, or people who wish to become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, who still feel in their own minds that they hold an allegiance to the country in which they were nurtured as infants or the country from which they proceeded to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until this Bill is in fact passed, British citizens will be able to become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> within one year, as is the situation at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  ask: When will the Government stand up for <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and condemn a communist government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Will the Minister indicate the statistics relating to the number of people, month by month, who have become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> since November 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) That <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> place great value on their freedom to choose their own doctor in all aspects of medical care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation that 2 weeks ago I asked him whether he would find out why <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> were penalised to the extent of about 20 per cent in paying for exactly the same service from Sydney to London and return as do other nationals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) That <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> place great value on their freedom to choose their own doctor in all aspects of medical care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And whereas the Australian Government has endorsed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights but has, to date, failed to implement Article 20, Sections1 and 2 of the said Declaration and therefore denied <span class="highlight">Australian Citizens</span> the rights inherent in that Declaration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Why are <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who give their place of origin as Croatia refused Australian passports unless they substitute the word, Yugoslavia, which they find objectionable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-69-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why are certain <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> of Croatian origin who have never been charged or convicted of any crime refused Australian passports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-69-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs: Is it not a fact that <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> of Czechoslovakian origin cannot obtain a visa to visit their former country of birth unless they forfeit their Australian citizenship? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government have discussions with the Czechoslovakian Government to abolish this discrimination and to protect the rights of these <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (2) The Australian High Commission in London has had approaches from about 60 <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> about the collapse of Pacesetter Travel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> were on tour when the company collapsed and those requiring assistance were helped by Australian offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The situation regarding work permits is that there is no right of appeal by <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> against a decision to refuse work permits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether it is true that <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> of Greek origin visiting Greece were at one stage, after the coup in Cyprus, subject to military call-up by the Greek Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of our attitude on dual nationality we were on the point of taking this matter up with the Greek Government in respect of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> of Greek origin but the Government in Greece changed and I understand that the exit points which were closed are now open and there is no difficulty in Greek/Australians leaving Greece. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By this hasty act, taken without consultation with the groups of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> concerned, the Australian Government has seemingly recognised the Soviet claim that the Baltic immigrants, upon their arrival in Australia, were really citizens of the U.S.S.R., and as such are not entitled to assume the protection of Australian citizenship until released from the citizenship of the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Human Rights and civil liberties and are therefore unable to express their will, we the undersigned <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> of Baltic origin humbly petition the Senate to express its moral support to the rights of the Baltic States to freedom and self-determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Australian Government’s diplomatic action to recognise officially the incorporation of the Baltic States into the Soviet Union has been taken contrary to the Prime Minister’s assurances to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> of Baltic origin given as recently as 1 7 May 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Are <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands entitled to vote at Federal elections: if not, why not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are all <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> in all Australian territories in the same position: if not, why not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the answers to (1 ) and (2) are in the negative, what steps are being taken to rectify this matter so that all <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> in all Australian territories are able to vote at Federal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should the Court Government pass this Bill and at some future date invoke its fascist provisions could any action be taken by the Australian Government to protect the civil liberties of Western <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and the existence of parliamentary democracy in the State? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has there been a change in the rights of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> of Baltic origin in regard either to the carrying of their national flags in Australia or showing Estonia, Lithuania or Latvia as their country of birth when applying for Australian passports or visas to visit other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740926_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can he inform the Senate whether there is a policy ensuring that employees of sensitive defence and security establishments are <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I would not be able to answer the question except to say that obviously the Australian Government would be concerned if any <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> were involved or their lives were endangered as a result of the fighting which is going on in Phnom Penh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs in a position to state how many <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> are living in the besieged Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh, and whether any arrangements have been made to evacuate them in the event of the city falling to Communist forces? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> have had their passports withdrawn during the same period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government does not approve of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> serving as mercenaries in other countries and disapproves the recruitment of Australians for this purpose in Australia or elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-47-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister, in order to qualify his statement on the Greek Government which he made earlier during question time in answer to a question which was not asked of him, admit that <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> of Greek descent or of Greek origin have been and are being conscripted into the Greek Army if and when they return to Greece? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can he explain the Australian Government’s reluctance to protect <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> against this imposition? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Government at least pay the outrageous financial penalty which the Greek Government imposes upon <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who wish to avoid this army service? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When this is linked with statements by representatives of the Government in Yugoslavia making allegations or repeating allegations which are unsustained and when it is linked with the treatment which is accorded to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who have recently been to Yugoslavia, it is a matter which ought to concern all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course many persons who have committed offences against Australian laws have been deported but the deportations which have occurred are of persons who are not <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have a number of statutory declarations which testify to treatment of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> in Yugoslavia which goes beyond the bounds of any treatment we would expect to be accorded to visitors to Australia or to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that honourable senators in the past have expressed concern about deprivations which <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> have experienced when they have gone to various parts of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No matter that <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> have gone back to Yugoslavia, they are entitled to the protection of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>ls it a fact that 5 other naturalised Australians are at present missing in Yugoslavia, pressure having been exerted upon them to renounce their Australian citizenship? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720921_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure the honourable senator that the Government takes this matter very seriously, but it must inquire into the allegations that are made before it can take any steps which the result of those investigations may necessitate in the national interest and in the protection of the rights of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720921_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been very little trouble of this kind but when it occurs it is up to us to take the strongest of stands on the rights of people to whom we have granted Australian citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The number of occasions upon which <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> are losing their freedom in visiting Yugoslavia is becoming far too numerous to be allowed to pass unnoticed or as some vague hoary allegation that they are members of some terrorist outfit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the new immigration rules published in Britain which have the effect of treating <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> in the same way as aliens, does the Government intend to alter its treatment of British citizens who come to Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think we have all experienced in recent times the problems of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who have gone to such countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But what we are doing here will ensure the protection of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the action of certain unions in prohibiting tha export of Australian produce is harmful to Australia’s economic health; will create loss of goodwill with customers important to exporters and will eventually lead to loss of income and job opportunities for <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and, in addition, lower returns to producers, many of whom have suffered great losses owing to seasonal conditions, and that it is of urgent necessity to examine the disparity between farm gate price for meat and the retail price to the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Firstly, on behalf of the Government I congratulate  Senator Negus  from Western Australia upon his recent marriage.In reply to the honourable gentleman, I am aware that many <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> have been complaining for a long time about the manner in which their telephone accounts have been assessed.Indeed, they have been complaining since long before this Government was elected to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the custodian of the rights of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> will it demand an explanation and/ or apology and reparation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We acknowledge also that the rights and the wishes of those people who are presently <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> living in the Torres Strait islands have to be considered and they are one of the most important factors to be considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian public ought not be subjected to terrible outrages such as were suffered in Sydney when bombs were used and innocent <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> were injured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who wish to ascertain in advance whether they are eligible for admission to the United Kingdom are advised to apply to the British High Commission or its offices in the States for the issue of an entry certificate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-77-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what is rejected and what is answered are the Minister’s unjust allegations against the previous administrations whose records stand investigation in such matters as the modification of the means test, broadening of the basis of eligibility for pensions and continuous endeavours to improve the welfare of all <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Six were <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and 3 others had previously lived in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As though the evidence I have already supplied were not enough to convict the last Government, through its Attorney-General, of misleading the Parliament and the nation, of deceiving a friendly foreign power, of imperilling the lives of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> by shutting its eyes to the evidence of organised terrorism, there is yet another, perhaps more glaring example of the existence of a dangerous, violent Croatian revolutionary terrorist organisation in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether the Australian Government contem  plates discussions with those European countries which seek to impose national service obligations on certain categories of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who visit the countries in question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the duty of the AttorneyGeneral to examine every possible source of information in his endeavour to ensure not only the safety of visiting dignitaries but also the safety of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the Attorney-General’s concern - a concern share’s by the Opposition - that the Australian community should not be subjected to terrorism or even the threat of it, will he advise why he has released the film ‘Skyjacked* which deals with the hijacking of aircraft and which could place the lives of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> in jeopardy, if the showing of the film Flight to Doomsday’ is any guide? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the AttorneyGeneral aware that some <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> are worried about the fact that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation will now be isolated from security information from many quarters of the world due to the recent visit, raid or call it what you will, on ASIO headquarters by the Attorney-General? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In taking the action which he did to protect the safety of prominent <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, including the Prime Minister, and a visiting dignitary of State, did he have in mind the threats of bombings and the actual bombings which occurred previously in the heart of Sydney last September? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a number of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and others have been attacked or charged in these documents, what arrangements can be made for the persons who have been attacked to obtain copies of the allegations made against them and to whom should they apply for such copies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are concerned to protect the safety of all decent <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am saying, in effect, is that if the Senate disallows these rules, then the Senate in my view can be legitimately charged with negating its responsibilities to thousands of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who are personally affected by the rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that over 30,000 <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> - and how many children none of us would know - are affected directly by the proposal which is before the Senate today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Were these people associated with terrorist activities against a friendly nation, namely Yugoslavia, former citizens of that country now domiciled in Australia, and prominent <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last week I asked the Attorney-General to investigate cases I mentioned of searches of homes of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> at night and without search warrants by Commonwealth police who, in 2 instances, possibly were accompanied by Yugoslav secret police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is none he has monstrously maligned and condemned a group of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who have no redress and who will long bear the scars of his action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the 23 years that’ the present Opposition was in government it was prepared to deport <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Opposition comes in here and says that we are the people who want to deport <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We intend to stop it, not by breaching civil liberties or by breaking the law but in the spirit of the actions which we have taken this very day in seeing that naturalised <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> shall not be deported under sections 30a and 30c of the Crimes Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this responsible action on the part of a government, an Attorney-General or a department in protecting the lives of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As though the evidence I have already supplied were noi enough to convict the last Government, through its Attorney-General, of misleading the Parliament and the nation, of deceiving a friendly foreign power, of imperilling the lives of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The life of a terrorist was insignificant in comparison with the lives of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> going about their normal duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what was the decision of the man who was the guardian of the safety of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, admitting that he was dangerous and that he was a danger to the safety of Australia,  Senator Greenwood’s  concern was the consideration of the terrorist, not the safety of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole question is that the then Attorney-General, who acknowledged the existence of terrorist organisations in Australia, while saying ‘We leave it to the Department of Immigration’, was making an appeal to the Department of Immigration to protect this individual - whether he is in gaol or not - despite the danger to the safety of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let him answer this: There is an accusation about  Senator Greenwood’s  support in protecting a dangerous terrorist who remained in Australia at a time when  Senator Greenwood  acknowledged he was in danger to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and when  Senator Greenwood  admitted there was a possibility of danger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a frank submission - despite the threat to the safety of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> - that honourable senators want such a man here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> have been accused publicly in this Parliament of crimes of violence without being able to defend themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I have heard disturbing accounts from <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who have come from Croatia many years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have come to Australia to be good <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a blight on the Australian community it is when the chief law officer of this country names <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> against whom one charge has never been laid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also had the duty to protect the lives and welfare of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Had he not done what he did he would have been guilty of dereliction of duty because of the threat to the life of a visiting dignitary and to the lives of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact of life is that on the evidence presented to this Government we had to take action to protect the life of a visiting Prime Minister and,indeed, the lives of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that instead of the Senate having to consider this motion of want of confidence in the Attorney-General, this Australian Parliament, having regard to the interests and welfare of the Australian people, should be lauding the activities of the Attorney-General, and I believe that no matter what our friends in the Opposition do, the Australian people will applaud him for the -action he took to protect the lives and welfare of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and visiting dignitary to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But we have to realise that what has happened - the allegations of terrorism and other allegations which have been made - has inspired in the minds of many <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and Australian residents of overseas origin a fear that they may be sent back to their country of origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But I believe that it is necessary to point out that the mere mention of extradition or deportation at the present time puts many <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> of overseas origin and many Australian residents of overseas origin into a state of panic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now they want to drag more blood out of a man who did something which he believed had to be done to protect the life of a visiting dignitary, to protect the life of the Australian Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  to protect the lives of Ministers of this country and indeed to protect the lives of decent <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How many trials must a man go through because he has taken the attitude that there are in the Australian community elements which rely on assault, extortion, violence and thuggery, which have secretive possession of dangerous and harmful weapons and explosives and which should be dealt with efficiently and quickly to protect the lives of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, including many of those who have come to Australia from Croatia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But, when it comes to a matter that was literally one of life or death, when it comes to a matter of the Attorney-General taking firm action to protect the lives and welfare of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and action to protect sections of the Australian community from bombings, honourable senators opposite react as though we were as bad as the people who commit these atrocious acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Council for Civil Liberties, which is in no way involved with the DLP and which  nobody would accuse of operating on a political basis, as reported in this week’s edition of the ‘Bulletin’ gave an interview to one of that journal’s reporters in which the gravest concern was expressed about the procedures adopted in the case of the raids on a number of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and residents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Australian Government and the Attorney-General, who is singularly inattentive, not regard seriously the fact that the Yugoslav Government falsely represented to the Australian Government the circumstances of the arerst and ultimate death of 3 <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely a government, if it is responsible for its <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, would say: ‘We will put on query the circumstances of these men.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I claim that people like these 2 persons have no desire to become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> place great value on the sanctity of human life and the physical, mental and social welfare of mothers and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Government in the Senate and Attorney-General, and which requested information as to which of those <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> named by him as terrorists had been charged and convicted of any crime in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to my earlier question as to whether any explanation was offered by the Yugoslav Government as to why successive Australian Governments were misled by the Yugoslav Government about the execution of 3 <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What steps, if any, are being taken by the Australian Government to protect <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> overseas and to have Australian citizenship recognised by such governments as that in Yugoslavia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With respect to each  of  the persons who had been in Australia at some  time  (a) which of them (naming them) were naturalised <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, (b) how long had each of them (naming them) been in Australia, (c) when had each such person (naming them) left Australia, (d) in respect of each such person (at the  time  when he  last  left Australia)  did  he have (i) an Australian passport, (ii) a Yugoslav passport, (iii) any other passport, and (iv) a re-entry permit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, a formal protest has since been made about the executions and an assurance has been sought that Australian Government officials will be granted consular access to any other <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> being held in Yugoslavia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> have been fortunate over many years in having had this 20 per cent tolerance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The guiding principle for the Government in the vitally important matter of the grant of Australian citizenship is that there should not be discrimination between different groups of settlers seeking to join the family of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wherever they were born, whatever their nationality, whatever the colour of their complexion, they should all be able to become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> under just the same conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People from any of the Commonwealth countries - now numbering no less than 31  -  have in the past been in a distinctive, and in the Government’s view, an anomalous position in regard to the conditions under which they could become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to end the confusion which has been permitted to continue since the Citizenship Act of 1949 and the use of terminology which has given many Australian the mistaken impression they are not only <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> but also citizens of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> have, however, the additional right and description of possessing the common nationality of the Commonwealth of Nations, called in some <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this point let me make it perfectly clear that the Bill does not change the situation whereby citizens &lt;&gt;f the 31 Commonwealth countries, whether they become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> or not, continue to have the status of British or Commonwealth of Nations subjects and as such have privileges such as the vote and eligibility to be appointed to public services under other Acts of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, however, recognised that citizens  of  these countries who have settled in Australia should be able to keep their present status under our law for a transitional period of 2 years during which they will be encouraged  to  become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Acting Leader of the Government recall the concern of the Senate when  Senator Murphy,  the AttorneyGeneral, in his statement to the Senate on Croatian organisations, asserted that certain <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> whom he named were terrorists? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister assisting the Minister for foreign Affairs whether it is a fact that the Government still has received no explanation of why successive Australian governments were misled by the Yugoslav Government about the execution of 3 <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What steps has the Government taken to assist the unfortunate <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who are the victims of a defiance of the Prime Minister’s requests by trade unions which have taken control of the institution of government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the Minister to the bans and boycotts imposed by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and unions subject to its dictates, on trade and communications with France, the recripocal action reported to have been taken by France against Qantas Airways Ltd, the refusal by French authorities to handle mail to Australia and the stranding of numerous <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> in New Caledonia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is anolomous and offensive to suggest that some <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who are not natural born may be deported at the discretion of the Attorney-General and we welcome therefore the opportunity when it is presented to us to indicate our complete support of the Government in the repeal of these provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We support the Bill because there is clearly a need to allay the fears which this Government has created amongst a lot of people that naturalised <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> will not be deported and there is no law which will enable them to be deported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attitudes have changed and the Government and the Opposition are as one in maintaining that there is an absolute equality of treatment which must be accorded to all <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> irrespective of whether they be natural born or naturalised and that Australian’s who are not natural born Australians should not be deported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> place great value on the sanctity of human life and the physical, mental and social welfare of mothers and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With  Senator Murphy  presenting a case to the International Court of Justice in The Hague on French nuclear tests and the rights and protection of humanity, can the Minister say whether the AttorneyGeneral will be returning home via Yugoslavia in order to have discussions with the heads of Government in that country on the rights and protection of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> in Yugoslavia and, further, to ascertain whether any Australians are being held in custody there? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Australian Government yet received information from the Yugoslav Government about the fate and whereabouts of the 9 <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> missing in Yugoslavia since about the middle of last year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier today I addressed a question to the Minister assisting the Prime Minister and referred to the possibility of  Senator Murphy  coming home via Yugoslavia so that he could look into various aspects of the human right1: of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who are selected as members of the State police forces to serve abroad in the United Nations peace keeping forces are not covered by repatriation benefits while others fulfilling a similar role in a military sense are covered? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the Government’s deep commitment to supporting and upholding the principles of the United Nations, will he take steps to correct this anomaly so that all <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who serve abroad in peace keeping forces under the sponsorship of the United Nations will receive full repatriation cover? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the policy of the Government that the dual system of national and commercial radio and television shall continue to operate and be available to as many <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> as is possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Commonwealth Government take action to obtain possession of these coins and thus preserve them intact for the benefit of all <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major effect of this mode of payment has been to enable Aboriginal recipients of social service benefits to exercise the same control over their use as other <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia, because of its size, is one of the most air minded nations in the world and consequently most <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> at some time or another travel on its domestic airlines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Early in his speech the Minister said that settlers ‘should all be able to become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> under just the same conditions’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they do not make this registration, after 5 years all they have to do is notify the Department of Immigration and by the act of notification they automatically become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present process of registration as <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, to which I have just referred, is taken away from them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only road to Australian citizenship is via 3 years residency and then a naturalisation or citizenship ceremony. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As all honourable senators know, <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> cannot retain Australian nationality after they have voluntarily acquired citizenship or nationality in another country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that we as a country should be very wary of any possible implication flowing from the removal of the renunciation provisions of the oath that Australia tolerates any other nation interfering with the liberties of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By removing the renunciation there is an implication that we tolerate other nations interfering with the liberties of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, we certainly wish that new term well as it is designed to improve the quality of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those factors at the same time provide for and allow a selective process whereby the quality of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> can be maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I for one cannot see why British citizens cannot obtain Australian citizenship earlier than 3 years after their arrival here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In most cases no language barriers arise between British migrants and Australians; people from British countries are able to fit immediately into our society and, if they so desire, after being here 12 months may become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The responsibility of Australian citizenship should not be taken lightly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that by deleting the section of the Act relating to renunciation of a migrant’s previous nationality, this Bill will give to those people most of the rights of Australian citizenship without p’acing on them the responsibilities of that citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> may not agree with the conditions that now operate in their former countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not see why persons seeking to become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> should not similarly take oaths or affirmations in which the monarchy is mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia extends citizenship to all those who marry <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These things are expressed, of course, in this Australian Citizenship Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is even more important than wanting them to join us as <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the Government  any  information of any description which confirms, or tends to confirm, the statement of the Yugoslav Government that the execution of three <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> was carried out by firing squad on 17 March 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Docs the Government consider that <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> are not mature enough to form their own judgments on where they should travel and the nature of the regimes of such countries? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Are the 2 men <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they are <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, why was the Australian Embassy in Yugoslavia not informed of their detention and trial? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am told that there are some Press reports about a trial in Yugoslavia of persons who the honourable senator says - I accept what he says - may be <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and who may well be citizens of Yugoslavia also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do know that the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs has already indicated in this chamber that certain information has been sought about events in Yugoslavia concerning <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who may be of Yugoslav nationality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Seven claimed to be naturalised <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(2) (3) and (4) The actions of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and organisations have to be understood in the light of the situation that has been created by the carrying out by the French Government of atmospheric nuclear tests in open disregard of a ruling of the world’s highest judicial tribunal, the International Court of Justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-83-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister representing the Minister for Defence say whether there has been a change of procedure with respect of recruitment of naturalised <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> wishing to undertake officer training courses at Australian naval colleges? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also it draws to the attention of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who happen to be present on such an occasion that this declaration is something of the greatest importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The renunciation segment of the ceremony reminds <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> that citizenship is costly and must be taken very seriously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another argument in favour of retention also relates to section 1 7 of the Australian Citizenship Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inclusion of the renunciation says to all <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> that once voluntarily accepting a new citizenship they have lost their Australian citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Australian position shows the seriousness with which Australia considers and expects any citizen to treat Australian citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I welcome persons who come to Australia and I am hopeful that they will become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> but I believe that acceptance of Australian citizenship carries with it some fundamental obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course dual nationality is something which an act of renunciation on the part of a person taking out Australian citizenship will not in any way overcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Italy, Greece or Yugoslavia- to mention 3 countries in relation to which dual nationality problems have arisenasserts a claim or seeks to exact an obligation from one of the native born citizens of those countries then the fact that those persons have become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and have formally renounced the citizenship of their country of birth will not persuade those countries to take any other attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a problem which is at the very root of the problems of dual nationality which, unfortunately, an increasing number of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> have been experiencing in recent times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Put in that bold form, it means that there is a significant number of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> in respect of whom the Australian Government is binding itself to say nothing, to do nothing and to assert nothing when they are in trouble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that Australian citizenship requires something more from the Government of Australia than an attitude which I believe is as weak as that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We evolved through a pattern of being simply British subjects to a stage where we were British subjects and <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that today we are proud to be <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and that the British connection is part of our history, of our sentiment and of our culture for a large number of people in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe, notwithstanding that there are some migrant Australians who may object to the fact that they have to renounce an allegiance, that we should insist and continue to insist that migrants accept Australian citizenship and renounce all other citizenships, and that that be the test and measure of becoming an Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But in terms of formal constitutional relationships and the obligations which the law imposes, I think we should insist, as far as we are able, upon Australian citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government, in considering this amendment to the oath of allegiance, was mindful of public reaction to its first proposal which would require prospective <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> to swear to uphold the Australian Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister surely would recognise that in the community today 700,000 people or more- a considerable part of the migrant community- have felt fit to become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and have not been concerned about the fact that they had to renounce all other allegiance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe that by the removal of that renunciation principle, which was a unanimous recommendation of the citizenship committee to the Minister in January of this year, we are acting on the unanimous advice of that committee and on the advice of the Department in accordance with the wishes of the Australian people and in accordance with the wishes of many people who would become naturalised <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> but for the fact that they have to renounce the citizenship of their original homeland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What has happened is this: The Senate, recognising what was contained in a Bill which the Government itself had introduced about the royal style and titles of the sovereign, inserted in the oath of allegiance to be subscribed to by prospective <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> the following words: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To my mind the Racial Discrimination Bill 1975 that is before us is, in its present form, in many aspects of the over-government type and is restrictive of the freedom of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> to express their opinions freely and to conduct their own affairs in accordance with the dictates of their consciences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Opposition proposes these amendments to clause 41 to eliminate the restriction contained in the clause which states that officers who are appointed to the Commission must be <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very difficult to see why there should be a restriction on the appointment of persons who are not <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> to such positions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is not the same as it is perhaps in the Public Service generally where it would be proper that people in very high advisory positions to the Government be <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and even take an oath of allegiance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think it is very restrictive and very unfair to many migrants who have not become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> but who would make admirable employees of these commissions if we applied restrictions on the people to be employed as permanent officers in these very large commissions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have particular regard to migrants from the British Isles who, under this Government’s legislation, must go through all sorts of rigmarole to become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of these migrants are not prepared to become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and have not done so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be very unfair to them if they could not be employed as permanent officers of the commission because they have not become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We put the argument on the very broad basis that it is discriminatory against migrants who may be very well qualified and who would be performing work which, by no stretch of the imagination, could be said to be work in relation to which the Government should be relying only on special advice from people who have become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think that service with an employer of the size of this Commission should not be restricted simply to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that there may well be many migrants to Australia who have not become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> but who nevertheless could be highly qualified to work for the Commission, as they may have varieties of qualifications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They should not be excluded from permanent appointment merely because they have not yet become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision also is extremely restrictive in relation to migrants from the British Isles who, although they are British subjects, have not yet sought to take out and may not really intend to take out Australian citizenship in accordance with the laws that this Government has passed recently in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that the direct relations, that is parents, brothers and sisters and so forth, of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who were formerly Vietnamese cannot be brought to Australia by the <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> from Guam and other refugee camps? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have always wondered whether our approach may not be better if we were not to emphasise racial discrimination as though it were the only form of discrimination that mattered but rather to concentrate on ensuring the human rights of all <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> in relation to racial discrimination or any other form of discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that when this organisation is established those who are responsible for its day-to-day administration will bear in mind that they are not only distributing facts and figures but also that the facts and figures which they distribute will be closely related to the total and everyday lives of the <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my speech on the motion for the second reading of the Bill I pointed out the influence and control that the increasing number of bureaus, commissions and committees were having over the lives of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I referred also to the influence that a sophisticated collection of statistics was having upon the lives of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the low excursion air fare available to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> to re-visit their former homelands in the Middle East, including Israel, to be discontinued by the airlines from December 1974; if so, will this impose hardship and expense on citizens who wish to make short journeys to such countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750715_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-4-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the evidence is, as the Minister acknowledges, that a substantial number of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>- a majority- are against the proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes it is an important step towards the goal of improving the enjoyment of civil liberties by <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and towards better administration in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The obligation to comply with this Act extends to all natural persons, whether resident in Australia or not and whether <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> or not, and to all corporations, whether incorporated or carrying on business in Australia or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I think  Senator Georges  can be satisfied that the general run of criticisms that he has made about foreign corporations has, to a degree, lessened the work opportunities of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government was denying that it was going to have any sort of effect on the availability of housing in the form of rental properties for <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But just a week or so before this Budget came out the new Minister for Housing and Construction  (Mr Riordan)  found it necessary to say at a conference in Sydney that there was a desperate shortage of rental accommodation for <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> today, a shortage exacerbated by the fact that there is an even more disparate drop in the rate of home ownership in Australia today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Papua New Guinea (Staffing Assistance) Bill is a Bill which conveniently transfers to Australia the responsibility which has been existing for the past 2 years and under which <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> in Papua New Guinea have been working within the control and under the direction of the local Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Social Services Bill, of course, is a Bill under which those <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who have resided in the Territory and who now come to Australia will have their period of service in the Territory counted as a qualifying period for the receipt of social security payments in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will only, as I suggested earlier, bring success to a socialist government which wishes to chase away from our shores and indeed internally any private enterprise, any entrepreneurial action by <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, and instead to bring about a situation in which there is a demand such as we see currently in England that the Government do everything. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I must say that that verified the feeling gained from my experience over the past two or three years, that we have a Department of Foreign Affairs which has treated Croatian born <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> as second rate <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750930_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why does this Government regard the denial of human rights of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> held without trial and without charges being laid against them in communist countries as of secondary importance and the need to avoid giving offence to communist governments as of paramount importance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Will the Minister for Foreign Affairs confirm that over the last 2 years large numbers of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> have been imprisoned in Yugoslavia, either without charges being laid against them or on trumped up charges of anti-State activities consisting of membership of bodies such as soccer clubs in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751002_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In reply, the Australian Golf Union was informed by the Foreign Minister that, in keeping with its strong opposition to the apartheid system, the Australian Government will not permit South African sporting teams and organisations, which are organised on the principles of apartheid, to enter or transit Australia and that, conversely, although <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> are free to play sport wherever they choose, visits by sporting teams to South Africa are officially discouraged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751007_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-55-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are not <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> entitled to better activity from this Government than they have been receiving? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as my Department is aware, over the last 2 years- that is, since October 1973- a total of 13 <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, of whom 10 were dual nationals, have been in Yugoslav prisons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it should be understood that the type of offences for which so many of these people whom  Senator Willesee  declares in his statement today to be dual nationals- they are <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> but he calls them dual nationals- are charged are the alleged crimes of membership of organisations in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is totally unsatisfactory that <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> should be left to languish and for the Australian Government apparently to wash its hands of people and to say that nothing can be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accepting the Government’s statement that it is entitled to that view, why is it not consistent and why is it not at least prepared to be active on behalf of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> when, as the Minister said this morning, some 13 of them have been imprisoned in Yugoslavia over the last 2 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am just wondering how many people in this country would have been aware of the fact that that number of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> had been imprisoned in a communist country if I had not asked the question? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-AU of the persons about whom I have asked have been <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the case which can be then made against the Yugoslav Government on behalf of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> will be all the stronger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a great pity also that the Australian Press cannot be relied on to be as outspoken on behalf of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> as apparently the Canadian Press was outspoken on behalf of Canadian citizens when their freedom and their rights were denied to them in another country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would make a tremendous difference if the Press of this country were concerned about the rights of people that are denied in other countries and were prepared to emblazon that fact in its pages, but one finds that there is virtually no information currently in the Australian Press about <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who are imprisoned overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish that the Minister would give some further particulars as to how asking questions about <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> imprisoned overseas will exacerbate troubles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not an exacerbating of those troubles to pinpoint the fact that <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> are imprisoned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assure the Minister that until some clear indication is given by the Government that it is prepared to act on behalf of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and to ensure that they get protection overseas I will continue to raise this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The British, when they were responsible for maintenance of law and order and justice in large parts of the world in the 18th and certainly 19th century, would never allow a British citizen to be treated in the way in which <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> are treated in various parts of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing with which I want to dispense immediately- it amazes me that it has been raised by  Senator Georges, Senator Greenwood  and  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack- is the contention that Australian embassies do not care about what happens to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether his attention has been drawn to reports that <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> are supplying arms to Fretilin forces and are helping Fretilin forces on the ground in Portuguese Timor? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the borrowing was to be over a period of 20 years, which would have meant that <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> would have had an obligation to repay somewhere in the vicinity of $17,000m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been said before and, no doubt, will be said again during this debate that those Croats who have come to Australia and accepted Australian citizenship have made a contribution to our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We, loyal <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> of Yugoslav-Croatian origin with other Yugoslavs, are disturbed and concerned that a very small but noisy element of so-called “Croats” has tarnished the good name of the overwhelming majority of honest, law-abiding, hard-working Croatians in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has found it necessary on several occasions to warn <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and Yugoslav citizens resident in Australia not to seek consular assistance from the ‘Croation Embassy’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, some segments of the debate have degenerated into unwarranted and  indiscriminate attacks upon a large number of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> of Croatian origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is most astonishing, is to find <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> of Yugoslav origins who have re-entered, through visa, their homeland undergoing police examinations and being harrassed by the Yugoslav secret police, being imprisoned, and some of them even executed, whilst the Australian Government looked the other way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Members of our community are deeply concerned that they have been discriminated against as <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, in Australia and when abroad, by the simple fact that they find it impossible to free themselves of being citizens of the Yugoslav regime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my opinion and in the opinion of many people the real purpose for not carrying out these surveys is that the Government is trying to cover up, from Australia at large, what countries and companies are investing in Australia and buying our natural resources which, in whole truth, belong to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Privy Council eventually decided that because they were naturalised <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and British subjects and owners of the vessel, the vessel was a British ship within the meaning of an imperial statute of, I think, 1799 and that the criminal law of England- in this case the Theft Act- applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, in relation to an offence committed off the Western Australian coast by naturalised <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> on board a fishing vessel normally operating out of Fremantle and licensed to do so under Western Australian law the ordinary jurisdiction of the Western Australian courts was not applicable and Western Australian criminal law could not be applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is important to understand that although relationships with Great Britain or the United States might be an important and significant part of the work of ASIO they are in fact subsidiary to the protection of Australian interests and the extent to which one gets information from overseas or the extent to which one provides information to people overseas can be judged only by the criteria of what is necessary in the defence of Australia and in the defence of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish now to deal with a very serious question I asked without notice on 2 1 February concerning the arrest of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That many <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> suffer considerable distress and financial hardship as a result of inaccurate charges and accounts for the use of telephone, telegraph and other related services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is also aware and very concerned that ASIO has in the past demonstrated a disregard for the civil liberties of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in this Parliament will necessarily be calling on <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> to work hard, to be more frugal and to accept sacrifices in the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate notes with concern the lack of action by the Australian Government to relieve <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> of the disadvantages of dual nationality, particularly as experienced in visiting former homelands, and urges the Government speedily to implement the recommendations contained in the Report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on Dual Nationality, tabled in the Senate on 14 October 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that for very many <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> dual nationality is extremely serious and even fatal in one sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All honourable senators will be aware that in the mid 1970s- around 1975- this matter was brought dramatically to the attention of the Australian community by the Yugoslav Government’s refusal to allow Australian diplomats access to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> held in detention for several months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Government even executed <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who held Yugoslav nationality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Luckily, I think that incident is unique in the sense that to my knowledge executions without the Australian Government being informed have not occurred in any other nation of former nationality of any <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That curse is still operative and affecting the lives of many <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those articles are only three of a very thick file of newspaper clippings which reveal that the problem of dual nationality is one which seriously affects <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> when they return to their former homelands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A split infinitive in the cause of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> is forgiveable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there any evidence that this Government is seeking to conclude like arrangements with the USSR or its Eastern European allies in respect to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who could be expected not to exercise the choice of nationality of their former homeland? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All one would need to have is a vigorous program by the Australian Government, a diplomatic offensive, to see that that technique is afforded to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who have a former homeland in the USSR or Eastern Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of the Western European democracies, we have a perfectly accessible means of assuring that the problems of dual nationality do not attach to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who come from those European democracies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of Foreign Affairs is not aware of any significant instances in recent rimes of harassment in Australia of dual national <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> by representatives of their former country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>6 is very relevant and extremely important to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who were born in another country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did have discussions with Yugoslav Ministers during a visit to Yugoslavia just prior to Christmas and I did raise the question of the problems experienced by <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> of Yugoslav origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact that, despite taking out Australian citizenship, people from Yugoslavia do not automatically relinquish their Yugoslav citizenship and all that that entails, including the obligation to undertake military service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have already mentioned, this is a problem for <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> of Yugoslav origin visiting that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raised with Ministers in Yugoslavia the question of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who were undergoing military service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very pleased to be able to say that three <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who were undergoing military service have had that obligation reviewed and at the very highest level two have had their obligations set aside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very pleased that the discussions with the Yugoslav Government have resulted in this understanding of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>’ points of view and I am very hopeful that the discussions which will continue with the Yugoslav Government, relating to the question of dual nationality, will have a mutually acceptable result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am delighted with that statement by the Minister because I feel that it indicates that the first step has been made in negotiating a bilateral agreement with one of the countries from which a large number of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> have migrated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I really feel that a multilateral agreement would be too complicated in the present situation, with so many people from different countries now being <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> suffer from many complexities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It related to the difficulties experienced by <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> of Yugoslavian birth when they visited that country and the difficulties that they experienced in this country by reason of their dual nationality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In practical terms, this means that it is impossible for an immigrant from Yugoslavia or his children to renounce their Yugoslav citizenship despite the fact that they become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of our community are deeply concerned that they have been discriminated against as <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, in Australia and when abroad, by the simple fact that they find it impossible to free themselves of being citizens of the Yugoslav regime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a shorter term objective, high priority should be accorded to entering into bilateral agreements between Australia and those countries whose nationality laws cause <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> to be dual nationals and who suffer disadvantage because of this circumstance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recommendation was for the Government to attempt to achieve a shorter term objective by establishing a high priority to be accorded to the making of bilateral arrangements between Australia and those countries whose nationality laws cause <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> to be dual nationals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recommendation indicated that these negotiations should take place with those countries whose nationality laws cause <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> to be dual nationals and who suffer disadvantage because of this circumstance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Government will bring down a report in the Parliament in the near future on this important question which affects a large number of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When they run into these problems in those countries, they find that although they are <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, the Australian consulate or embassy cannot help them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that over the years Greek <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> have been raising this matter with Foreign Ministers of various governments and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the present Government, but nothing has been done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We did have the problem in the Second World War of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> being interned for the first two or three years of the War, as they were also during the First World War, and then being called up when the Japanese came into the War and sent to fight against the Japanese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is up to this Government and future Australian governments to recognise those difficulties and to defend very vigorously the rights of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, whether other people think they have dual citizenship or not, and to come to agreement both with those conglomerations of nations which have reached some agreement on this and with individual nations whose former citizens are now citizens of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about a proposal of the Government to permit an organisation which will not be answerable to the Parliament to put <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> under surveillance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the words ‘likely to’ give to the Organisation a very wide discretion in putting under surveillance the activities of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Virgo,  the Minister for Transport in South Australia, said that the health of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> was more important than the expense to this country of motor vehicle emission control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So fuel consumption is the main thing and the health of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> is a secondary consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Arc there agreements between Qantas and any other nation which prohibit entry to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> on the grounds of race or creed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government therefore makes no arrangements for <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> to obtain visas to enter Rhodesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it seems to cast an onerous obligation on the Attorney-General, so be it, because he is the principal law officer of this country and he should discharge that obligation in the interests of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who are threatened in any way by the provisions of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But because of the Government’s rejection of our accountability proposals, because of the Government’s rejection of our suggestion for the tightening of the definition of subversive activity, the Opposition feels obliged to say to the Attorney-General that when warrants are issued to carry out a search of premises of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who are not guilty of offences, to open their mail and to intercept telephonic communications, the Attorney ought to satisfy himself that every alternative legal and practicable step has been taken to obtain the information which is sought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That many <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> suffer considerable distress and financial hardship as a result of inaccurate charges and accounts for the use of telephone, telegraph and other related services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have given a great deal of thought to the question whether I should recommend that a right of appeal should be given to the <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> or residents concerning whom security intelligence is thus collected or communicated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am therefore thrown back very largely on the sort of situation to which  Senator Button  referred- I think with some degree of disquiet- that is, that to a large extent the rights, reputation, liberty and perhaps even the future career prospects of individual <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> will be in large part determined by the personal attitude of whoever happens to be the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That: Many <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> suffer considerable distress and financial hardship as a result of inaccurate charges and accounts for the use of telephone, telegraph and other related services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-0-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Insofar as certain minimum standards of justice, social welfare and income guarantees are applicable to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, in our view they should also be applicable to the people of Norfolk Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement we have just heard is a disaster for the health standards of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, lt completes the destruction ofthe universal health insurance system to which the Labor Government was committed and lo which on many occasions we had been led to believe that the Fraser Government was also committed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said: ‘Over 90 per cent of our trade, even though the statistics show that the passengers are <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, in fact is migrant trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How many <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> are affected by a law of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics which became effective on 1 July and which stipulates that anyone with two parents born in countries that now comprise the USSR will be deemed to be Soviet citizens? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Soviet law have special implications for <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who come under its provisions and who may wish to visit the Soviet Union? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The citizenship provisions of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act were amended to extend Australian citizenship to any person (not already an Australian citizen) who was ordinarily resident in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands immediately before their transfer to Australia and who is now resident in Australia or an external Territory and who wishes to take up Australian citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790918_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-63-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that at the Blackburn North Baptist Church on 1 1 August and again at the Robert Blackwood Hall at Monash University on 12 August this year, <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> protesting against the Indonesian invasion and continuing presence in East Timor were kicked and punched by staff attached to the Indonesian Embassy, resulting in injuries to these citizens? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We regret sincerely that you have been perhaps unable to make someeffort to ascertain the true facts, because if you would have done so, you would have surely discovered that the parallel organisation named Slovene Society Karantania has been established by the independent will of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> like you, by people of differing but independent religious or political views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are and have been, since we arrived, loyal <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> with no political claims on the old homeland, beyond the claim of free travel to visit our relatives and friends still living there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have discovered no evidence that <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> of Slovenian origin have been imprisoned, tortured or killed when they visited the old homeland, especially not so in the last several years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main reason why I quoted from the roneoed document which was sent to all senators and which was the property of all senators was to support the argument, which I think is supported by all honourable senators, that no disadvantages should be incurred by <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> by reason of dual nationality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In its political guerrilla war against the Labor Government of the day, it dragged decent <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and senior public servants to the Bar of this Senate to answer questions on loan raisings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I have mentioned already, each year about a million <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> travel overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That seems to me to suggest some attempt to question the right of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> to decide what information they will put on the passport when the Australian Government has made it quite clear that a town or city of birth is adequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that in that context it is the responsibility of any Australian government to attempt to deal with these matters bilaterally; to reach an agreement which, whilst meeting the requirements of other governments, also meets the interests and concerns of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to accept the responsibility, which we must accept, of as far as practicable looking after <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, there is a great need not only to improve the standard of the consular service but also to expand it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A matter which requires special attention regarding <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> of Baltic origin travelling abroad is the information contained in Australian passports issued to such travellers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this capital of Australia we have a situation in which certain governments say to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>: ‘We will tell you what you must put on your Australian passport’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we discussing with these countries on a governmenttogovernment bilateral basis to try to meet what are to be fairly considered the legitimate interests of many <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, but what  Senator Tate  is putting is that we as <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> should not be required by the domestic requirements of other states to put the place of birth in the passport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The charges will be mainly incurred by people who are not <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and will place those persons resident in Australia in a position similar to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who must pay for passports in order to travel overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The difficulties that arise for <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> from their dual nationality are however of continuing concern to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst speaking about this question of dual nationality I should mention that the Government is keenly aware of the concern felt by certain <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> about the new Soviet Law on Citizenship which came into force on 1 July this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the meantime I can give an assurance that nobody will lose Australian citizenship through the operation of a law of another country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the decision of the High Court in the Communist Party case, I should have thought that any Attorney-General would have to do a lot of explaining to this Senate to show why <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and Australian organisations should be stripped of their rights- indeed, completely extinguished- by the dictates of Cabinet without reference to any criteria argued before an independent tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have already had a crisis situation in Lebanon when <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and people who have been residents of this country for a long time wanted to bring out their relatives from a very difficult situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That could not basically be regarded as an unfair charge because it will place persons travelling on a foreign passport in the same position as <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, who pay $25 for their passports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the records are a bit dicey in the case of the elector in Hume, I am curious as to how we will arbitrate on cases involving people of Yugoslav origin who are <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and who have been here for more than 10 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Frankly, I am not impressed with the idea of making the fundamental human rights of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> dependent upon what the judiciary says will vary from time to time, as time unfolds, and as circumstances and conditions alter because I do not want human rights in Australia to be dependent upon time and circumstance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
