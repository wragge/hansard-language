    <p>What action has the Prime Minister taken to try to establish the truth of the matter, the circumstances of this man’s trial, and the meaningfulness of Australian citizenship to the Communist Government of Yugoslavia, or is the Prime Minister prepared simply to accept the insults to Australia of a foreign government which has already been shown to have deliberately and flagrantly withheld the truth from his Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Consultations are already proceeding at my request between my Department and the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Attorney-General’s on the desirability of having included in the ‘Notice to Australian Travellers’ - which my Department issues to all Australian passport holders - a reference to the fact that <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> abroad are required to observe the laws of the countries in which they happen to be and that, should they encounter difficulties, they should immediately contact or request access to the appropriate Australian Government representative in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-11">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, we oppose it and I hope it will not be long before the Government is able, by legislation, to remove that provision completely from the Agreement because we believe that that Act should be repealed as it applies to conscription not only of migrants but also of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker,  the agreement in question is under review at the present moment, as part of the larger context of the general situation relating to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who go back to their homeland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does it not reduce the value attached to an Australian passport by <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> if entry and departure to Australia may be made without this document? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, will the Minister also assure the House that uniform regulations will apply to all <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> without passports and not only to those whom the Government wishes to keep out or desires to send into exile? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I would commend to the Government the idea that savings accounts of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and fixed deposits of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> at branches of Australian banks overseas should be regarded as acceptable savings for purposes of this Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, is it not a fact that the Australian Labor Party also required migrants to become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> before being eligible to receive age pensions and is it not a fact that it was this LiberalCountry Party Government which removed this bar to the receipt of pensions by migrants? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This applies equally, of course, to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we have applied philistinic indifference towards the development of an Australian film industry which would absorb Australian talent and allow it to revive itself and achieve a sense of expression, which would be in harmony wilh national aspirations and which would interpret the aims and the aspirations of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There have been referendums which clearly indicate that <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> will not tolerate the proscription of this political party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be a simple matter for the Department to say as a matter of procedure: ‘We do not provide Australian citizenship to people who belong to this political party’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Immigration  (Mr Lynch),  the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  or any other Minister in the Government - not even that great democrat who looks after the Department of External Territories - has not a right to deprive a person of citizenship in this country if he meets normal requirements and standards which are not regarded as illegal if they are held by other <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has always been the policy of the Commonwealth Government that migrants should become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, not so much for the material benefits which this would confer upon them but rather because citizenship, once conferred, would enable them to play their full part as <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> in the affairs of the community and to have the opportunity of total identification with the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On Sunday the High Commissioner reported to the Government his view that all <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> in the Karachi area should be evacuated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In India, where the possible dangers to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> from involvement in the fighting are much less than in Pakistan, our High Commissioner has advised Australians known to be living near to affected borders to move further inland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>12 to present a Bill for an Act to amend the Social Services Act 1947-71 to make pensions payable to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> outside Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by the Government in an endeavour to prevent <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> being exposed to this dreadful traffic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However it is known that migrants from some countries retain their original nationality, upon becoming <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-59-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, they also receive social services and other similar benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That they believe that the Aborigine, in common with ail other <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, have a right to assemble in any peaceful manner of their own choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That they believe that the Aborigine, in common with all other <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, have a right to assemble in any peaceful manner of their own choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We, as <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, should be proud, as the Minister pointed out, that 80 per cent of married age pensioners in Australia today own their own homes and that 50 per cent of single age pensioners also own their own homes, Many of the others are satisfactorily housed in aged persons homes under this Act or are living comfortably with their families as they choose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view the pupils are all <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and the schools deserve help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the facts of the matter are that approximately one in seven people living in Australia today are not <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the Bill, as indicated by its long title, is to make pensions payable to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> outside Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> shall not cease to receive pensions because of residence abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are going to give portability of Australian pensions overseas we should be negotiating a quid pro quo in the interests of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who were migrants from those other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, it is important for us to try to protect, for example, the rights of certain German pensioners who, because they have become naturalised as <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, have lost their rights to German pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall certainly try, in negotiating this with the German Government, as far as possible to preserve here in Australia the rights of former German nationals who have become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and are resident in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of this Act relating to the qualifications of persons to receive age, invalid and widows’ pensions and the rate of, and payment of such pensions shall, subject to such exceptions, modifications and adaptions as are prescribed, apply to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who are outside Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular he may have forgotten 2 points: Firstly, that our qualifications for residence for pension purpose in Australia is very generous by world standards; secondly, that Australian pensions are paid to certain people who are not <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first point is that the Bill applies only to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the migrants who would want to go abroad after they had qualified for an Australian pension are in point of fact not <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have not taken out Australian citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not require people to take out Australian citizenship in order to qualify for pensions and I think that this is right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we do not demand that these people should get Australian citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The groups of elderly migrants who would want to go abroad are predominantly those who have not applied for Australian citizenship and therefore this Bill will not help those who are really most in need of this kind of help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point is that this Bill if accepted would give away entirely the bargaining position of the Australian Government to protect the pension rights of people who have acquired them overseas and who have subsequently come to Australia and become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am simply saying that if the Bill were adopted it would not put us in the position where we could bargain with overseas governments in order to protect the rights of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who were formerly nationals of other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party proposes paying pensions to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> living in Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is it necessary to go through the pretence of working out treaties with other countries for the purpose of granting <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> a right to their pensions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who receive superannuation or other types of pension are now entitled to receive those pensions overseas; why not citizens who receive old age pensions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is, as the Minister indicated, that this Bill applies only to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the Bill, as 1 am sure will the overwhelming majority of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How many officers of his Department who represent Australia overseas have not yet become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> by naturalisation or registration and where are they serving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720411_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-34-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As at 28th February 1972 all Australian-based officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs serving overseas were <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> by birth, residence, registration or naturalisation, with the exception of 6, all of whom were British subjects and citizens of the United Kingdom, serving in the following countries: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720411_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-34-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Prime Minister cause an investigation to be made into the anomaly to which I have referred so that at least some sort of justice may at last come to the very oldest of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who are being denied their proper entitlement to social welfare? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people who come here will not return to America; they will become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Persons qualified to own Australian ships should be <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, and bodies corporate should have their principal place of business where the Commonwealth of Australia has jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720426_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister may waive the residence requirements for minors, the spouses of Australians, and former <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-47-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the funds of the local council and the Hunter District Water Board are so depleted that they cannot provide water to the homes of these worthy <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr O’Malley  and I assured them that their interests and the rights of all <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and overseas visitors were best protected by a full disclosure of the facts so that the public can be fully informed of just what is going on in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be appropriate to mention at this point that the Convention makes special provision regarding members of the consular post who are either <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> or who are permanently resident in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> or ordinarily resident in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the existing legislation private servants other than those serving the Head of Mission may be subject to the jurisdiction of the Australian courts in respect of acts performed in the course of their duties if they are foreign nationals or foreign residents but immune if they are <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> or residents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This earlier Bill had the purpose, as its long title showed, of amending the Social Services Act to make pensions payable to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> outside Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Bill has the advantage over the Bill which I introduced on behalf of the Labor Party of making pensions payable to persons living overseas even if they have not been or become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not dealt with the situation of people who are <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, who were born here, who have always lived here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has not chosen to answer today the charge that he brought into this House a Bill purporting to be in the interests of migrants, which sought to confine the granting or the portability of pensions to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, thereby excluding a large number of very good migrants to this country who have made a substantial contribution to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They suddenly woke up to the fact that they have offended, and deeply offended, a large proportion of our migrant population, and that many of our migrant population, because they have chosen to become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, have votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party says: <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> shall not cease to receive pensions because of residence abroad’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> shall not cease to receive pensions because of residence abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, it was a Bill in good but simplistic English, because it stated that people who are <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> will be able to carry their pensions outside Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party, in its amendment to the Government’s Bill, is completely ignoring its previous proposition that portability of pensions should apply to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another absolutely fundamental proposition was advanced in the Opposition’s earlier Bill, and it was that pensions should be paid to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who went abroad, no matter what period of residence they had had in Australia before either going to their homeland or to some other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no residence qualification required in regard to invalid and widow pensions, but I point out that the proposition which the Labor Party previously advanced contained the qualification that those who would benefit had to be <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The more the Government speaks out on this issue the more obvious it becomes that this Bill is merely a mirage intended to mislead our migrant community and other deserving <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who are thirsting in this Government’s dry, barren desert of social services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first was to ensure that the benefits of portability were available to all Australian pensioners, whether they were <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Bill is passed in its present state unamended there is no doubt that during the next few years the beneficiaries will be <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill now before this Parliament will enable the Minister to enter into an agreement with other countries, and pensions will then be paid to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who go to reside overseas, whether permanently or temporarily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each agreement will be drawn up in terms of mutual relationship existing between Australia and the participating country, with a view to obtaining the best possible benefit for <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are other reasons why migrants do not take out Australian citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill recently introduced by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  would confine the benefits to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and this would fail to help those very persons of whom I have just spoken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation is long overdue and I am sure it will be welcomed by all <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By limiting the provisions of his Bill to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> he invited this national Parliament to discriminate against a large section of our migrant community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that it would be far better for them to have second thoughts and to say: ‘Let us have an Australian pension for <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and Australian residents as a right that they may take with them wherever they desire to go in their retirement.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A family of 5 - that is, with 3 children - have, in addition to the benefits and entitlements of all <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, an average expenditure on them of $1,850. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we can legislate to protect our most valuable migrants - the children of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> would like to know the answers to those questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that an Australian Government would not dare to proceed under cover of darkness in this way against any <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> unless they were young ones or black ones. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter what colour a local government or a State government is, the Commonwealth must place itself above local politics and realise that if it is to be truly representative of all <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> it must treat them all as equals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Surely, however, the large numbers of children who leave after 3 years of high school are also still <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, but 1 do not think they come within the range of the sympathy or the interest of the last 4 Commonwealth Ministers for Education, including the present Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After such a tremendous length of time <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> are now free to invest their money at will, wherever they so choose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wish to raise a serious anomaly which exists in relation to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who joined British forces - in this case I am referring to the British Air Force- in the 1930s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-56-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the responsible Minister to look at the probability of giving full recognition to these people who are <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, who have retained their citizenship right through and who have served the British Commonwealth and the British Commonwealth only.I can understand some reluctance, to extend this benefit to people who are European migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-56-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I feel that people who are <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and who have served with British forces should be given recognition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-56-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even from the brief description I have been able to give it will be apparent that we are working steadily towards creating the widest possible range of opportunities for all <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, young and not so young, male and female, to enable them to develop their talents to the full, to their own social and material benefit and that of the nation as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that we remember that this is a proposal to take Australia away from the basic principle that has served Australia so well at least over the last 23 years, and that is that <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> should have the opportunity to acquire - that is, to own - their own land and to build their own homes upon that land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first of them is that this proposal will act quite contrary to the efforts of those young <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who seek to pay off their own home - who seek to discharge a mortgage within 10 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In justice it is wrong for <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> to be liable to be subjected to this kind of a situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But surely we have reached the stage in this country where we could move beyond the idea of workers’ compensation and start to think about compensating all <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> when they are injured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the Government is to be congratulated on the progress which has already been made to see that all <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> have available to them a wide range of social security benefits when and if they need them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I welcome that because it is the intention of the Government to ensure that all <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> will be equal in all ways before Australian law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As though the evidence I supplied were not enough to convict the last Government, through its Attorney-General, of misleading the Parliament and the nation, of deceiving a friendly foreign power, of imperilling the lives of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> by shutting its eyes to the evidence of organised terrorism, there is yet another perhaps more glaring example of the existence of a dangrous, violent Croatian revolutionary terrorist organisation in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To the contrary its members would be failing in their duty if they did not fight with all their power to protect the limited rights of country people and to give them, to the maximum possible degree, something at least approaching equality of representation to which they, as <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> are entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should be recalled that employees of ASIO make reports on a great number of people who, for instance, seek appointment or promotion in the Commonwealth Public Service, and on a great number of people who seek to be naturalised as <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this was supposed to be a snide way of appealing to the sensitivities and the great pride of the Jewish people who are <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, I say to the Prime Minister that nobody could have, greater pride in the contribution to Australia that the Jewish people have made and nobody would be more anxious to respond to the protection of their position as free citizens of this country, totally free from any vestiges of anti-semitism, than members of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today the Prime Minister in his statement had to undo the harm done by that statement when he talked about deportation not occurring to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> or there being no abridgement of the rights of Australian residents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition, of course, then referred to the rule of law, that is, the law of his Government which  sets oat that,  under the provisions of the Crimes Act, <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> could be deported despite the fact that they held citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The guiding principle for the Government in the vitally important matter of the grant of Australian citizenship is that there should not be discrimination between different groups of settlers seeking to join the family of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Wherever they were born, whatever their nationality, whatever the colour of their complexion, they should all be able to become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> under just the same conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People from any of the Commonwealth countries - now numbering no fewer than 31  -  have in the past been in a distinctive and in my view an anomalous position in regard to the conditions under which they could become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is important to end the confusion which has been permitted to continue since the Citizenship Act of 1 949 and the use of terminology which has given many Australians the mistaken impression they are not only <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> but also citizens of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this point let me make it perfectly clear that the Bill does not change the situation whereby citizens of the 31 Commonwealth countries, whether they become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> or not, continue to have the status of British or Commonwealth of Nations subjects and as such have privileges such as the vote and eligibility to be appointed to public services under Acts of Parliament not administered by me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is, however, recognised that citizens of these countries who have settled in Australia should be able to keep their present status under our law for a transitional period of 2 years during which they will be encouraged to become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, it applied only to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and therefore ignored those people who had lived and worked in Australia for a long time but had not taken out naturalisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is making the job of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Bryant),  who is sitting at the table, far harder than it would otherwise be because this program endeavoured to paint a picture and excluded from the scene anyone who happened to be interested in the welfare of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> whether they be Aborigines or anyone else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 19 April I directed that information be sought about the following 10 persons whom Australia regarded as <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole attitude of the Labor Party towards the execution of 3 <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> in Yugoslavia is shameful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> were stood before a communist firing squad - it amounts to that - and you are prepared to accept the matter as casually as you do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is shocking to hear an Australian Prime Minister adopt such a trifling attitude to the putting to death of 3 <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all he should be the protector and the guardian of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do so because I recognise that the honourable member for Moreton has in the past had to depart from the views of his colleagues when matters touching Australia’s independence and Australian citizenship had to be dealt with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole emphasis of the present Government, led by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  and of my personal administration has been to give Australian citizenship a status and a recognition across the world which it has hitherto lacked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The records show that in the past 24 years <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> have been murdered, executed and imprisoned in various parts of the world without let or hindrance or apparent interest by successive Australian Governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An overseas administration that treats Australian citizenship with contempt in the future will have to confront a determined Australian Government dedicated to the care and protection of all <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> - for the first time in this generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been very concerned within my portfolio to see to it that the embarrassments of the past are no longer experienced by <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> proceeding to countries of their birth which recognise dual nationality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So all that Australia did as a nation for many years was to warn <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who were proceeding to other countries in which they may have been born that Australia could do nothing for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will put an end to the neglect of Australian citizenship which has existed for a whole generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a case involving the lives of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> the representative of the Yugoslav Government did not go to the Prime Minister, did not go to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister  (Senator Willesee)  and did not go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we ought to get from the Government, if it treats this seriously, is a firm statement that in the future if any <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> are arrested in Yugoslavia, brought to trial in Yugoslavia, sought to be punished in Yugoslavia, this Government ought to be informed immediately that takes place so that it can take care of the rights of those people according to Australian law, so that they are properly represented, so that they are not railroaded to the kind of death to which these 3 men have been railroaded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a complaint about the Government’s failure to assert and protect the rights of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> in Yugoslavia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of public Importance that people who are <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> have been killed overseas in these circumstances, but the rest of the charges made by the honourable member for Moreton concerning the subordination of the Australian Government’s obligations to assert and protect the rights of its citizens overseas are appropriate and apt only in relation to the conduct, the reputation and behaviour of the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Insofar as <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> were concerned, that was being pursued through the Ambassador in Belgrade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been revealed that there was a trial and execution of 3 <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> on 17th March. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first area is in the manipulation by the Government of the terms and conditions of employment of public servants, consequently aggravating the cost pressures on <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, and the second area is the aggravation in the private sector provided by the terms and conditions of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This clause is to be read in relation to clause 8, by which Australian citizenship is to be granted under a new and uniform set of conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>British subjects who have been resident in Australia or New Guinea for 5 years - providing no crimes have been committed which render them liable to deportation - may merely notify their desire to become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said something about the proposals in the Bill to make it more difficult for people from Britain to become citizens of Australia let me say something about the provisions designed to make it easier for migrants from every country other than Britain to become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will say little about the reduction in the period of residence except to make the point that we are about to make Australian citizenship cheaper than the citizenship of almost any other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Minister is proud to be the architect of this act of cheapening Australian citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No possible objection can be made to the proposition that all <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, whether natural born Australians or immigrants, should be equal before the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the proposition is surely feasible and clearly logical that Australian citizenship is not granted merely for the asking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is Australian citizenship to be got on the cheap, on terms, as it were, or is it to be granted when worthiness is proved? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People from any of the Commonwealth countries - now numbering no less than 31 - have in the past been in a distinctive and, in my view, an anomalous position in regard to the conditions under which they would become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out the anomalous position of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clearly in the interest of Australia that our grant of citizenship be an exclusive one, that our political rights and obligations be the only ones to which naturalised <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> are subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Steps are open to the Australian Government to try to ensure that our naturalised citizens enjoy the full rights that our other <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> enjoy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government is able to conduct negotiations with all those nations whose laws on nationality work to the disadvantage of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be possible to negotiate bilateral arrangements with those countries whereby the acquisition of Australian citizenship cancels the original citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard of this preferment or alleged entitlement given by the United Kingdom to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, but in fact under the present immigration laws of the United Kingdom <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> do not have any automatic entitlement to United Kingdom citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not really mean anything to the <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This act is distasteful and unpleasant to persons who used to be required to make it, as is evidenced by the fact that there has been an increase in the number of applicants for Australian citizenship since the proposed amendments to the Act were announced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For all practicality, here in Australia it makes no difference to their relationship with the Australian government or with other <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is a most important day and a most important event in the lives of all our new <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> when they take their citizenship oath. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the amendments proposed to the Act will assist materially in making those persons who were not born here and who want to avail themselves of Australian citizenship more readily and more strongly able to feel that they are going to become members of the Austraiian family and that they are able to identify with all other Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the present time British subjects may apply for Australian citizenship by notification after having resided in Australia for one year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Electoral Act provides that they should enrol for voting after 6 months, and they are entitled to vote whether or not they choose to become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that some <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> could be placed at a disadvantage if they should return to the countries from which they came without having renounced their former allegiance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that they ought to be able to go to those countries as <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> on an Australian passport having made it quite clear that they have renounced their citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have adopted Australia as their country and they are happy to become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think we ought to be encouraging migrants if we want them to become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the best way for us to encourage migrants to take out Australian citizenship is to point out to them the advantages of becoming <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Migrants cannot really become part of a community unless they participate on a level with their fellow <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When migrants become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> they have the advantage of being able to choose the Government of the country in which they live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In becoming <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, migrants have just as much say in choosing the government as anyone else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will make the oath of allegiance more practical and simpler and will bring uniformity to the processes through which migrants must go to become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>overwhelming majority of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the momet we are all horrified by the execution of 3 <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> in Yugoslavia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time it kept on the statute book the provision in the Crimes Act which permitted <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> to be deported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will wipe out this disgraceful provision and thus ensure that no Australian Government, now or in the future, can deport <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also hold the view that wherever our citizens are, there should be equal access of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> to Australian consular and diplomatic missions whenever there is a need for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say in summation that the Government hopes for the support of the House in this sincere bid to wipe out discriminations and to bring to Australian citizenship a new status for the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first relates to the general attitude to and care of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> by the Government while they are overseas, or wherever they may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We as a government were shocked to discover what had happened to some <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt in our negotiations with other countries to remove the concept, and sometimes the burden, of dual citizenship from those who take Australian nationality we will be putting this point and I hope that in the negotiations the Minister, who should have learned a lesson from the tragic events in Yugoslavia, will put this point strongly and it will help him in those negotiations if he can say that <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> have personally renounced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with the Minister’s statement that we should be endeavouring to get rid of this burden of dual citizenship for those <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who do not wish to maintain it, and to include in the form of the ceremony the formal renunciation may strengthen his hand in any negotiations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again I say to him: Considering what has happened in respect not only of the humiliation that <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> have undergone but also at their death in their countries of origin, anything that strengthens our hand in negotiation is worth having. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The petition also requested payment of $6 billion to enable Aboriginals to achieve economic parity with other <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, and associated this claim with a claim for land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is necessary that we preserve to the maximum Australia’s energy resources for the benefit of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Minister he knew all the time that 3 <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> had been murdered in Yugoslavia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unregulated and spiralling prices cause severe hardship to most <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We regard it as anomalous and, in fact, objectionable that legal matters between <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> should be determined by a court sitting in another country, composed of judges appointed by the government of that other country and delivering its judgments in the form of advice to the head of state of that other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As well as being <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, Vlasnovic and his colleagues were also nationals of Yugoslavia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-40-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to repeal those provisions of the Crimes Act 1914-1966 which permit <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> to be deported from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has in recent weeks given a number of assurances that <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> will not be deported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that, whatever might have been the merit of these provisions in the 1920s when they were introduced, they are inconsistent with the view which we have of Australian citizenship today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have the view that all <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, whether bom in Australia or coming here and becoming naturalised, should be treated in an evenhanded and equal way by the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We recognise that it is necessary, in view of the climate of fear which has arisen, that these fears should be allayed amongst <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The House may recall that even before the Attorney-General made his statement in the Senate I took the opportunity to ask the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Grassby)  to give an undertaking, firstly, that no naturalised Australian citizen would be deported, and secondly, that even nonnaturalised <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> convicted of some crime would not be deported to any totalitarian country if they had some political reasons to fear a return to that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask this individualist laissez-faire Liberal Party which pays such tribute to the rights and privileges of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>: Where is this great thing tonight? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the worst features of this whole episode was that the Attorney-General had knowledge of 3 <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> having been shot in Yugoslavia but refused to convey it to the Prime Minister and so embarrassed the Prime Minister of Australia by refusing to act in a responsible way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the question which inevitably arises in view of the recent difficulties with Yugoslavia over the incident of the execution of 3 <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> in that country, about having that country as our sponsor, 2 other questions arise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is no longer appropriate that any possibility should still remain of any government in Australia taking legal questions to, or of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> litigating their differences before, the courts of another country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we are to take what has happened in this field in Western Australia as an indication of What would be acceptable to the Commonwealth, then I believe that this House should not give such a b ank cheque because I believe that what has happened in this field in Western Australia is an infringement on the proper and just rights of individual <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and is completely bad in principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Seeing that the Opposition has taken the trouble to draw the attention of its repleted ranks to what we are discussing I think it worth my while to repeat the figures that I was quoting from the gallup poll conducted in 1973 relating to the Government’s proposals to require prospective <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> in future to actually stand up for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now it is suggested that the present Opposition should defy the expressed view of the majority of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, ignore the distinguished representatives of so many organisations, including the Returned Services League, and take us back to the past and to a hurtful imposition which seems to be required by some either to deter people from joining the family of the nation because they do not want them or to impose hurt for hurt’s sake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was said that the Minister would use his undoubted - as he would believe - persuasive abilities in order to persuade certain countries where there are real problems of dual nationality, notably the Government’s new-found friends in Yugoslavia, to overcome the problems which dual nationality causes a significant number of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Leader of the House is consistent in wanting to provide equal opportunities for <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, whether they live in the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory, to be represented in the Senate, the basis of their representation should be the same as for those citizens who reside in States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will not allow contractors to employ expatriates - this is the point that the honourable member for Corangamite  (Mr Street)  raised earlier - and all people employed on the pipeline should be <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> or people who have resided in Australia for the past 2 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder),  who has already spoken in this debate, has since his election to this chamber expressed his concern that the same opportunities should be provided for Territorians, whether they be in the north or here in the Australian Capital Territory, to express a view on matters that affect all other <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, for those that affect all other <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> must equally affect them because they too are <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question involved is: Are these people as <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> to receive this payment as a right, because a special additional tax is to be levied on them as on everybody else, or is the payment to be made only in those States which have reached an agreement with the Commonwealth? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is, of course, doing what he is paid for and one would be disappointed if he failed to earn the money he is so paid - paid in many cases to hide the facts of the previous Government’s policies, to hide the fact that the last Liberal Government sadly neglected the State’s rights of Western <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and that past Western Australian Liberal Governments failed to stand up to their Federal counterparts to gain just recognition of the rights of Western <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact of the matter is that whether the Opposition likes it or not, or whether a majority of people in another place like it or not, <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> - the residents of this great free land - will not become tenants in their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I conclude on this note: If the States had been able to implement effective legislation for consumer affairs, it would not have been necessary for legislation to be before this House at this time to bring benefits to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the reasons I have given, in spite of the fact that this can be an instrument of socialism, I still support the Bill because I believe that this organisation can be a significant part of the process of returning the equity ownership of businesses and property in Australia to the hands of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The effect of the legislation will be to enable the present Government to destroy the opportunity now available to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> to insure for a standard of medical and hospital care above that of the minimum standard provided by the Hayden scheme or any other scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they want to insure to go to a private hospital or to attend a private doctor, they should be permitted to do so and there should be no legislation which enables a Minister to prevent <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> from having that opportunity merely because he wants to force them into his nationalised health scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet here in 1975 the Opposition- the Liberal Party and the National Country Party- is able to say that a situation should exist by which the Privy Council located in England should rule on what is the law in, say, New South Wales, or what is the correct legal solution to a problem between 2 <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> living in Hobart or Perth, merely because the Australian Government, according to one view, does not have the constitutional power to say what the Canadian Government said back in about 1933. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-81-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I raise this matter of public importance again today- it was gagged last week- because I believe that the special requirement imposed on 9 South Vietnamese refugees seeking entry into Australia carries implications for all <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and all those who may seek citizenship in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Due to the many representations we have received on this matter I ask the Minister to ensure when such a Bill is introduced- I hope it will be soon because the amalgamation the Australia Police Force has no legislative backing- that we will have ample time to study it, that he might consider laying the Bill on the table for a reasonable period so that we can adequately consider it, so that the States and the police forces of the States can adequately consider it and indeed so that the <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> can have a look at it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But I believe that it should be regarded by the Government as a matter of urgency that this one area of discrimination against newly arrived migrants should be eliminated by the positive action of the Government to give equal employment opportunities in the Public Service to all <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> regardless of their ability to handle effectively the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been clear from the outset that the Torres Strait Islanders shared with the Government of Queensland a general reluctance to see any change in the present location of the border, in the status and rights of Torres Strait Islanders as <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, but that in addition they attached great, perhaps even over-riding, importance to the protection of the total environment of the Torres Strait which they saw not merely as the basis of their livelihood but of their characteristic and independent way of life <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>While the Embassy will do what it can to assist <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> in whatever circumstances may develop, and we have been looking at possible arrangements for some time, it is clearly better for Australians to make their own plans in good time and while circumstances allow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Was a circular distributed in the Department of Foreign Affairs recently asking officers to indicate whether or not they are <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-5">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>2747 on 19 August 197S, has there been an amendment to the Citizenship Act so that Foreign Affairs officers who are not <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> are not precluded, by virtue of the nature of their duties, from becoming <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department wished to know how many officers who are not <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> might have their opportunity to become so affected by their service in the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has become clear that, while officers who are not <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and wish to apply for citizenship must have resided in Australia continuously for one year immediately preceding the date of being granted a certificate of citizenship, the further two years of residence in Australia required for the grant of citizenship may be fulfilled while serving overseas as a member of the Department of Foreign Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under these conditions officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs who are not <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>- and the Department naturally expects the few officers who are not yet <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> to become so as soon as practicablewill normally meet the residential qualifications while pursuing their career in the normal manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There remains one anomaly, members of the armed forces and Merchant Navy who are not <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> but apply to become so are catered for by a specific exemption contained in the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-5">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The new procedures in no way lessen the protection afforded to the general Australian population because in fact those people who travel overseas and who are residents of Australia but who do not have Australian citizenship will be in exactly the same situation as they would have been if they had been required to obtain re-entry visas before they left. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With respect to other aid- a number of institutions in Australia is seeking to send aid; it is not only the Australian trade union movement that has an interest in despatching assistance to the people of East Timor- the position remains that the Australian Government is not prepared to permit <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> to go into a position of total uncertainty as to whether they will be able to land their vessel or take their vessel into the waters of East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill, if carried by electors of the States, will permit the <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> in those overseas Territories-I imagine honourable members and honourable senators and the great majority of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> everywhere, including in those Territories, would wish them to remain Territories of this country-to vote in any future referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am confident that most <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> will see Canberra not only as the seat of the Commonwealth Parliament and the national capital but also as a community of 200 000 people, many of whom have moved here from other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, as they involve a reduction in resources available to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, the Government must regard proposals for overseas aid expenditure in a similar light to proposals for other government expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I find it really hard to believe that, after responsible government has been in existence for so long in this country and after the democratic battles of the past, which went on for so long in this country and in other countries, we now have to start all over again and start fighting for the same basic democratic rights involving something like 300 000 <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is now a group of people whom I can only describe as political troglodytes or power hungry legal eagles who seek to turn the clock back and play petty politics with people’s basic rights, people who for the sake of some cheap political advantage, for the sake of influencing a referendum result are prepared to deny basic rights to or disenfranchise 300 000 <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We in the Northern Territory seem to have been fighting, certainly ever since I have been a member of this House and since Jock Nelson, the former member, was in this House, a continual battle to obtain the rights which we should have as <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> and which I believe we did have in the years from 1907 to 191 1. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are not talking about Angola, but in the case of the Lebanon we have concrete examples of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, many of whom have been in their early teens, who have gone from Australia to fight in that war- not against the foreign government, not against the government of Lebanon at all, but for one faction or another in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the Government is sincere in its endeavours to prevent <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> or residents of Australia or people who have been in Australia for 12 months- the classes mentioned in the Bill- from engaging in hostile activity it should accept the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like to make one thing perfectly clear to the Opposition, to listeners to the broadcast of these proceedings, to migrants in this country and to the House: The Migration Act 1958 confers power for the deportation of persons who have not become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> in certain defined circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In short, I am concerned that certain <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who originally came from Yugoslavia are being intimidated and have had their individual freedoms interfered with by a consular representative from another country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I bring them to the attention of the House because I find it incredible that <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> living in Australia and ostensibly enjoying the individual freedoms which that citizenship conveys, including the right of free association, the right of assembly and the right to practise one’s religion, are having their rights interfered with by the consular officials of another country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I do suggest that those who express the wish to become and who do become solely <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> should not be intimidated or in any way have their individual freedoms interfered with by any consular official from any country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That fact was pointed out in an article in the Sydney  Sun  which said that <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> in other parts of the world were absolutely destitute because they had run out of money and could not get home because people here in Australia- a militant minority- were too jolly greedy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australian officials from a wide variety of government departments and instrumentalities are desperately needed at posts abroad, not only to protect Australia’s bilateral interests and the rights of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> but also to ensure that Australia’s views are represented fully, and occasionally even forcefully, at the ever-growing range of international conferences which take decisions affecting so many aspects of Australia’s prosperity and way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it would do no harm if some effort were made to inform these people that if they wish to become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> they have to take more steps than merely placing their names on the electoral roll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we do say, though, is that Australian citizenship is something to be prized and not something to be taken lightly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The stock answer is that these Aboriginal people are <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, they are residents of Maryborough and they are answerable to the laws, the ordinances and the norms, just as any other citizen might be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am advised from information available to the Foreign Investment Review Board, that of the 20 principal mining companies in Australia with majority foreign ownership, seven have a majority of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> on their boards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-57-6">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There can be no doubt that the activities in my community during the period of the Yom Kippur war were such that all those young people who were involved publicly and openly as <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> in signing forms on television, making it perfectly clear that they were recruiting for the armed forces of Israel, would have come within that provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is something which in my view should not take up much of the time of this House, but given the multicultural and ethnic background of Australia and given the problems that arise in the international arena, it is not unlikely that <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> with ethnic backgrounds will find themselves in situations where they will want, not because of money but by virtue of deep social and political convictions which go back to the land of their origin, to involve themselves in the armed forces of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, it is penal legislation, and clause 9 ought to be reviewed because the fact that it is penal legislation will provide very harsh penalties for most <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government and the Australian people do not object to the free expression of political ideas, but it is offensive to this country if individual persons purport to be representatives of a non-existent foreign state and seek to represent <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> of a specific ethnic origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An important consular duty is to ensure that <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> arrested overseas are treated with due process in accordance with the laws of the state where the offence may have occurred and that they receive the same benefits of the law which the foreign state affords to its own subjects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This assistance includes: Inquiries relating to the welfare and whereabouts of Australians; repatriation and financial relief of distressed Australians in the form of a repayable loan as already mentioned; welfare visits to persons in gaol, hospital or in an asylum; assistance in natural disasters or emergencies; and making available to <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who have been arrested a list of local lawyers who may be able to assist them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For this reason permanent residents in Australia, Commonwealth and State public servants overseas whose conditions of remuneration adequately cover their position and <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> overseas who are employed as locally engaged staff at Australian establishments outside Australia and entitled to the provision of health care reimbursement of expenses as part of the employment conditions, are excluded from the concession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For all these reasons, despite all the boasts by the Government, in my view far too little effort is being given to providing for the needs of these people, who are now <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, members of this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have already pointed out, the actions- often they are illegal- of the security forces adversely affected and caused loss and disadvantage to thousands of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> who had no redress by way of judicial scrutiny and no opportunity to right the real wrong that was done to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I will not take up the time of the House by debating this motion, but I would point out that significant inroads into the liberties of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> are involved in this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These honourable members, to mention only a few, have shown that they are true and honourable Australians who are genuinely concerned for the welfare of all <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Looking at the background of ASIO, no member of Parliament can say that in the past it has not abused its prerogatives and has not- in many cases wrongly, on a number of occasions illegally- jeopardised the fundamental rights of many thousands of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do so because people listening to this debate might think that neither this Government,  Mr Justice  Hope, nor ASIO itself, has any regard for the individual rights and freedoms of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the difference between the honourable member for Dundas  (Mr Ruddock),  the Government and the Opposition on this matter really comes back to an approach to the responsibilities- as supporters of the government see them- and the role of the security forces and our approach in balancing that role with the rights and liberties of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only are immigrants now asked to pay for the administrative costs they incur at a time when they are least able to pay for them, but they are the ones from whom money is to be taken to pay for the supporting programs designed as immigrant welfare- the props and supports designed to give immigrants greater equality with other <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  has pointed out that the charges will apply, for the most part, to persons who are Australian residents but not <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister omitted to say that once people are accepted as <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> they will have to bear the burden of paying for a passport when they intend to travel, because, as <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, they will need a passport to travel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another matter that occurs to me is that in many respects there are very few incentives for people to become <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While there may be a very small incentive contained in this Bill, the fact that the charges by and large fall on people who are not <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, may just be one extra factor- I will not make much of it- which will encourage people to think about the advantages of taking out Australian citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By and large, in our system we do not have anything that people can recognise as a substantial inducement to taking out Australian citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Refugees who are quite stateless are very anxious to take out Australian citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But for people who are still held in good repute by their home countries overseas, are entitled to return there and have passports issued by their home countries, there are quite often few incentives to encourage them to take out citizenship in Australia unless, of course they are particularly interested in any public employment or in taking any public office in Australia that would require their taking out Australian citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So for that reason I hope that the amendments contained in this Bill will act as some small additional incentive to get people to think about taking out Australian citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is precisely because there is that difference of approach, that different perception of tasks, that the rights and liberties of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> would be made more secure if we adopted the phraseology and the standard set by the Attorney-General when he said that he was prepared to make as much detail as possible available to the Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The difficulties that arise for <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> from their dual nationality are however of continuing concern to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While speaking about this question of dual nationality I should mention that the Government is keenly aware of the concern felt by certain <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> about the new Soviet law on citizenship which came into force on 1 July this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime I can give an assurance that nobody will lose Australian citizenship through the operation of a law of another country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have only to look at the situation at Tweed Heads on the border of New South Wales and Queensland to see that half of the <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span> in that community can use one-armed bandits while the other half cannot conduct a street march in support of onearmed bandits even if they wanted to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There should be no need to suggest in this House that the power to place listening devices in the homes of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, the power to wire-tap, to telephone tap the conversations of <span class="highlight">Australian citizens</span>, are very great powers indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
