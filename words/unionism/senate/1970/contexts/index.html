<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for Works aware that the Canberra branch of the Young Liberal Party recently carried a resolution stating that those who’ benefit from <span class="highlight">unionism</span> should join unions and contribute to the costs of achieving union benefits? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In directing my question to the Minister for Works f refer to what I understood to be a statement by him yesterday when compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> was being discussed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unfortunate that on occasions when he gets on to industrial <span class="highlight">unionism</span> we see all the military training come out and a display of the hatred of those who have built Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us take as an example- it is a purely hypothetical one but such a situation could occur- the case of the appointment to the Council of a gentleman like the former member of Parliament from Western Australia, Harry Webb, who had a vast knowledge of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind  Senator Hall  that the Australian Council of Trade Unions, which was formed in 1926, had as one of its major objectives industrial <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, which meant inevitably the amalgamation of unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Do any Government Departments have a requirement for compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> for employees within the Commonwealth Public Service or within statutory authorities associated with the Commonwealth Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is no requirement for compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, will the Minister assure the Senate that those electing not to join a union will not have the right to employment withdrawn solely on the grounds that they are not unionists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose they could, but they may not wish to, having regard to the status of the work which they are doing and the fact that they feel they want to remain separate from the general body of industrial <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said that if a person goes into an industry where there is either compulsory or preferential <span class="highlight">unionism</span> he is entitled to know how his union operates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a system of government in this country whereby some people accept it as a responsible office to represent their people in Parliament for parliamentary purposes, lt is a very contemptible conception of the function of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> for people to think they can organise mobs, disrupt industry and deprive people of wages for what are really political purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition members of the Labor Party support compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, with no freedom for the individual to make up his own mind on whether he should join a union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am afraid that certain elements which are working their way into some of the unions are eating into the vitals of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and are spoiling what has become a very great and valuable body of working people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But is it and was it a principle of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> that a person should deny management his services for a political reason in a politically inspired strike or a stoppage when, before he stops, he announces that the stoppage will last for only 24 hours or 2 days, so that it becomes merely a terrorist activity in the industrial world? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is typical of the way that those favourable to the Australian Government have disrupted trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> at any level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think  Senator Cavanagh,  with his trade union background, would appreciate that it is well known that the present Greek Government is concerned with the virtual extermination of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, particularly the Greek Seamen’s Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a possible by-product of the present Military junta in Greece, trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> was non-existent with resultant industrial exploitation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the extermination of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, the Government has introduced some form of incentive payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Newsweek’ article agrees that their methods are ruthless and that they will do anything to bypass all the regular canons of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and the provision of reasonable conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is interesting to see this development in the high priest of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in Australia because, if the industrial power was to be utilised in the way it was threatened to be utilised, it would have had the effect of depriving those who were employed by the companies in the Dunlop group of the work and wages on which they were dependent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also think it is strangely inconsistent for the ACTU to be urging the principles of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and collective action  as a  condition of the supply of labour whilst  it  regards resale price maintenance as not permissible as a condition of the supply  of  goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  hope that the same principle will be applied in order to break down what is at present the vicious application of  a  principle of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and collective action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Democratic Labor Party submits that such political strikes cause not only economic damage, loss of wages and public inconvenience but, more seriously, they pervert the real role of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-113-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The quotations from the judgment show, for example, that the writers of legitimate trade union history, one of whom was Hancock, said that an original development of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in Australia was its decision in the 80s of last century to play a direct part in politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-113-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parliament, anti-war meetings, law and order, pensions, compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and the Springbok tour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-113-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unions and unionists would have to call a halt to political strikes and bans if <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in Australia was not to be threatened, said  Mr J.  Maynes, Federal  President  of the Federated Clerks Union of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-113-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that <span class="highlight">unionism</span> was being threatened by the activities of a group of communists, con-men and  Johnnys-come-lately <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-113-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a new trend in trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> for a trade union official to feel that he is superior to the law, that he can use violence in the streets and defy the normal processes of law in this country, that he can call on industrial stoppages to impoverish the economy of the nation and the workers in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-113-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: Recognising the great and enduring contribution which industrial trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> has made to Australia and to the general standard of working conditions, is it not a fact that effective industrial <span class="highlight">unionism</span> depends vitally upon the active participation of all unionists in the bona fide affairs of their unions; and is it not further a fact that intimidation and apathy are the twin destructive elements of <span class="highlight">unionism</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent days I have seen reports of gallup polls registering approval by 70 per cent to 75 per cent of secret ballots in trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he asks me to assent to his proposition that the effectiveness of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> depends to a large extent upon the active and purposeful participation by unionists in their organisations, I would readily agree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes in compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and everything else that is compulsory except compulsory service in the nation’s defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the ALP agree with compulsory voting; they believe in compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We did not have compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what happened to them in this great democracy, in this time of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, freedom and liberty? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was just as enthusiastic about <span class="highlight">unionism</span> as  Senator James  McClelland was when he was in the group movement, and I was in a union before I was required to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister representing the Minister for Labour and National Service say whether it is the policy of Commonwealth departments and instrumentalities, including the Reserve Bank, to  have  compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> for staff members including those who are employed as cleaners? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711026_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is no policy supporting compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, can the Minister say whether pressures are being exerted by trade union leaders to force people to join a trade union? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711026_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be well known that neither the Commonwealth Government nor any of its instrumentalities effectuates a policy of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711026_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the AttorneyGeneral: What powers does the Commonwealth Government have in relation to compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and the protection of the rights of individuals who do not wish to join a union? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why has the Australian Country Party’s national secretariat sent a questionnaire to more than 50,000 members of the Country Party asking their opinions on topics from abortion, militant <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and migration to the health of the coalition? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why has the Australian Country Party’s national secretariat sent a questionnaire to more than 50,000 members asking their opinions on topics ranging from abortion, militant <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and migration to the health of the coalition? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As this black ban is a clear case of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> by threat and virtual blackmail, will the Minister point out to the trade unions the financial harm that they are doing to these people on Kangaroo Island who are already under great financial stress, in the hope that some semblance of decency and respect for the rights ot the individual might be shown by the trade unions lifting this most undemocratic black ban? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the rights of the individual are being ignored by trade unions in their demands to enforce compulsory trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> on some farmers on Kangaroo Island by imposing a black ban on their wool, does this mean that any farmer who employs non-union labour on his property will be similarly black-listed, thus preventing the delivery of wheat and livestock? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711125_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can remember Albert Monk, who was probably the most respected figure in trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> over the last 20 years, about 10 years ago at a conference on immigration, when the move to reduce the number of migrants was just as powerful as it has been in recent months, saying straight out: You cannot turn off and turn on immigration like a tap’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He believed in justice for the working class, but he was very sound in his judgment on union matters and never subscribed to any of the foolhardy practices so frequently seen in the ranks of <span class="highlight">unionism</span> today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Soon there would be compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, with the independent teachers and the Teachers Federation joined together, and the philosophy of teaching would be nationalised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Four of those people were active in trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in the Labor Party and in their own church which happened to be the Catholic Church in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has happened in trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in other parts of the world must not be allowed to happen here, but it will inevitably do so unless something is done to prevent it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This conference of federal unions condemns the anti-union legislation introduced into the Federal Parliament, by the Minister for Labour and National Service,  Mr Lynch,  which has as its objective the emasculation of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in the Commonwealth Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that what we have to do is to bring back responsibility into <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in its relationship to the arbitration system and the acceptance of decisions by that system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before turning to a new subject, I want to refer to the proposals as to compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> outlined in the Minister’s statement of 7th December last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Noting the overall policy of the Government of trying to weaken <span class="highlight">unionism</span> we direct attention to ACTU policy of strengthening <span class="highlight">unionism</span> by amalgamations and membership recruiting and urge affiliates to take all necessary steps to build membership and conclude amalgamations by taking appropriate steps consistent with ACTU policy to overcome existing barriers to amalgamations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Federal President of the Federated Clerks Union, said that the intentions of the Government constituted a serious attack upon trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said the proposals were designed at this time when white collar <span class="highlight">unionism</span> was developing in Australia to interfere with the right of trade unionists to organise effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that  Senator Murphy  in his contribution to this debate will not tell us that direct bargaining is the answer to all the questions of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> as the Communist Party does and as 1 have heard members of the Labor Party in this chamber repeat almost as a slogan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When the Minister for Labour and National Service made his statement in the House of Representatives last December in which he foreshadowed this legislation he said that the Government was very concerned with the efforts of some trade unions to bring about compulsory trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government and,  i  believe, the community are opposed to compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 wholeheartedly agree and the Liberal Party agrees with the concern expressed then an efforts by some trade unions to introduce compulsory trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister foreshadowed thatth is legislation would contain some ways and means of preventing the spread of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> by certain activities of some trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such proposals would pose a major threat to the system of conciliation and arbitration and to <span class="highlight">Unionism</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One reason why these amalgamations are being sought by left wing unions is, of course, that it is an essential part of the policy of the Communist Party of Australia to destroy craft trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Comrade Sharkey said that trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in Australia has to be conducted entirely on shop lines, and that the Communist Party regards these craft divisions as a source of weakness and disunity, hindering the growth of revolutionary strength. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another great gap between principle and performance is to be found in the Government’s provisions or lack of provisions as to compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Once more the brave words of  Mr Lynch  at the time of the statement of intent were a proclamation of the great menace of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in these words: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We wilt amend the provisions of the Act relating to registered organisations to prevent unions from enforcing compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Before turning to a new subject, I want to refer to the proposals as to compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> that 1 outlined in my statement on 7th December last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why did he need the fulminations of the Democratic Labor Party to find out that compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> had disadvantages and difficulties? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We stand firmly for strong, vigorous industrial trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, not political trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, not rule by trade union bosses but authentic rule by democratic process from the grass roots of the trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not one of the speakers on the Opposition side has referred to this or to the enormously valuable steps that will be taken to help to strengthen authentic industrial <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until  3  years ago - and I pay this tribute - the industrial leadership of this country for the  17  years before that was by a great Australian,  Mr Alfred  Monk, who understood the difference between authentic industrial <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and political <span class="highlight">unionism</span> which exploits the worker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody has ever heard me on my feet or in writing attack the ACTU or even  Mr Hawke  or authentic trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am as strong an advocate as anybody in this place for trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the trade union movement moved towards the left and towards political <span class="highlight">unionism</span> it did a grave disservice to its own people and the people generally of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make the plea to the grass roots trade unions of this country to look towards industrial <span class="highlight">unionism</span> rather than the anarchy of political <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To that end Government supporters would be well advised to read the complete history of English trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> written by Sidney and Beatrice Webb, the standard work on  the  trade union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For as long as trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> has been on the agenda of history it has had to fight for its survival. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier in my statement, I indicated the Government’s grave concern at the recent and continuing efforts by some trade unions to bring about compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Th Government, and 1 believe, the community are opposed to compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We will amend the provisions of the Act relating to registered organisations to prevent unions from enforcing compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was the DLP that was pressing for compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It persuaded the Minister for Labour and National Service who, after all, is the Minister responsible for industrial relations, to change his attitude to and to drop his position on compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact, the law in that country encourages mergers of unions insofar as it discourages having parallel <span class="highlight">unionism</span> within the same work place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator said that that is a principle which is fundamental to <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Ducker  is a distinguished member and, I hope, a continuing member of the Australian Labor Party, who is fighting for the same things for which the Liberal Party is fighting - that is to say, prosperous, democratic and reasonable trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I echo what  Senator Wright  has said - that there is a body of responsible trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in this country which abhors all of these activities and that the inability of that body of responsible trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> to express itself within either the trade union movement as a whole or the Australian Labor Party is one of the regrettable features of what has developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>We find this situation even in the field of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>‘Does the Minister for Works agree with his senior Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Urban and Regional Development,  Mr Uren,  who is reported to have said that he is not in favour of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and that he believes that unions should be free and independent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some members of the organisation are so contaminated by the political atmosphere that they forget principle in order lo use this matter of <span class="highlight">unionism</span> for attack. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 note  Senator Cavanagh’s  interjection, lt is somewhat inconsistent with his statement only yesterday that he did not favour compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> is being forced on the Public Service by coercion because if a person does not join a union he will be entitled to only 3 weeks leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know and  Senator McLaren  knows that the real reason behind  Mr Clyde  Cameron’s change of front after he won government was simply to ensure that as far as possible there would be compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, and it is ridiculous for  Senator McLaren  to suggest that no-one is being compelled to join an organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third major point is this: If we are to submit to compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in the Public Service, let it be open, let it be done by legislation, and let it be in accord with these great claims of the Labor Party that it will do everything openly, and let us not have it done by this back door method. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let it say that if it wants to impose compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> it will put the matter to the test in Parliament and to the scrutiny of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But he and his government, provided for 23 years the vehicle of conscription to <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in many industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe in preference to unionists, not compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Deputy President,  I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard for the information of honourable senators the history of the policy of the Labor Party on compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and preference to unionists from 1928 to 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 point out that for only a very short period, in 1942, was compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> part of Australian Labor Party policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>New paragraph 10 (w) read: ‘That the Platform be amended to provide for compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and that the Commonwealth Government be requested to provide for compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> by regulation.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said,  Senator Greenwood  is one who would know exactly what has been canvassed in the area of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, because he was involved in many discussions on the latest amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitratioin Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that in those discussions the principles of the then government were being examined as to whether some action might be taken to prevent compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and to stop the principle of closed shops. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Provided no safeguards against Communist union officials strengthening their position through amalgamation of unions and threatened to weaken the position of Right-wing unions through the proposed ban on compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When they were in Government they also said: ‘We don’t believe in compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>’, but they allowed the waterside workers, and many others, to have compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They accepted industrial <span class="highlight">unionism</span> as it existed throughout the various sectors pf industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I heard  Senator Cavanagh’s  argument that he did not favour compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> but that he favoured preference to unionists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely, if you do not believe in compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> you do not believe in compulsory union political levies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the Hursey case was a blot on trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in this country, lt is something that trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> can never be proud of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not think that the attitude should be adopted that trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> is a holy cow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> is costing much more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> could be strangled by some people talking about freedom and arguing whether it is a pacesetter for industrial gains. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, a fundamental objection which I have and which I know my colleagues have is to the attempt to introduce by the back door the principle of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let those people who believe, as I do, that there are moral reasons for people who gain the benefits of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> to join unions - I was in such a position and belonged proudly and voluntarily to a union - admit that they cannot hope to achieve their ends by legislating for morality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This thing called ‘preference to unionists’ is a backdoor method of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> because the end is the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can fully sympathise with those decent trade union leaders who want more people in their unions, who want more money for their unions and who, as one Government Minister said, need it because <span class="highlight">unionism</span> is becoming more costly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As in the case of its caucus, the ALP is to use the numbers game in trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind the Senate that contained in this platform of the Liberal Party are impeccable principles regarding effective trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is not a piece of legislation aimed to improve <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, to raise the standards of the Australian community or to help commercial and industrial working conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me sum up by saying that there is no doubt in the world - the Opposition would be the first to concede - that everything that is possible to do should be done to achieve healthy, vigorous and voluntary trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in itself has its strength in voluntary <span class="highlight">unionism</span>; it has its weakness, its destruction, in compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why is he advocating compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This appeal points out that compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> for manual workers exists through economic strength. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The accusation is that my intention is to give preference, in the letting of contracts, to those organisations which support compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in their establishments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have stated that nothing in the enforcement of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in industry would lead to anything like the graft which it was suggested by interjection tonight I might get from builders or that builders, by their method of operation in Australia, are getting from the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators on the Government benches are simply bemusing themselves when they say honourable senators on this side of the House would do anything to destroy or render inefficient the cause of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> has grown during this century into a real contributor to our community life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In private employment trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> grew against great difficulty and great hostility but in public employment we have the extraordinary picture tonight where a Labor Government in office, the creature in its own self of the trade union movement - the trade union movement is its heart and soul and the mainspring of its life - pits its reputation and pits its credit for impartial and equitable administration because it wants to promote trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, it says, in the Public Service, that is to say, in the employment services of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We thought - God forgive us - that even under a conservative government the Public Service Board would be so mindful of sympathetic treatment of the Public Service that surely there would be no urgent need for rampant <span class="highlight">unionism</span> against the government of the day in order to establish equitable treatment amongst individual public servants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But no - bless your heart -  Senator Bishop  sits there, benign and complacent, representing a government which is so intent upon promoting <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in the Public Service - a <span class="highlight">unionism</span> to advocate the cause of the underdog, to see that public servants will get justice against the repressive demands of  Senator Bishop  and his colleagues - that we need to have preference for <span class="highlight">unionism</span> m the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, I heard johnny.comelately’s statement but if the honourable senator would give me a little time I too could deliver a lecture on the history of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But tonight I am just making a few contemporary comments on the asininity of the grounds on which the Government, represented by  Senator Bishop  and  Senator Cavanagh,  puts its case that there is need for rampant <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and preference to unionists in the Public Service as a matter of equity and fair conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard emotional language from  Senator Greenwood  and  Senator Carrick  in particular, phrases like ‘economic blackmail’, ‘coercion’ and ‘compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> through the back door’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Bishop,  of course, had to remind him that the Government of which he was a member and previous governments of his Party had not always been consistent to his cherished notion that compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> is a great evil to be fought tooth and nail, in particular in the case of the stevedoring and railway industries where there have been cases of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Carrick  in the course of saying many extraordinary, hyperbolic, emotional things, made this extraordinary statement: ‘Preference to unionists is the same thing basically as compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a back door method of introducing compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is preference to unionists which  Senator Carrick  says is the same thing as compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this debate much has turned on whether this is in fact an attempt to introduce compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> by the back door. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to come now to this question of whether what we have in the case of the present determinations is in fact preference to unionists or is compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the arguments that was put on behalf of the company which was resisting this application was just the point that the Opposition has attempted to make in this debate, that in other words the requests for preference were so wide in their scope and ambit that they really amounted to an attempt to introduce compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> by the back door. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all of these matters the High Court held that to grant preference to unionists over nonunionists did not amount to compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> but was preference permitted by the Conciliation and Arbitration Act within the jurisdiction of the Commission and unobjectionable constitutionally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we are told by the Opposition that measures which do not compel anybody to join a union but which give preference in leave to unionists amount to compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> does not arise in this case at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Hawke said in support of his demands that many companies in Melbourne would be blackballed if they did not support compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After it had been announced, his view was reported in the Australian’ of 27th February last under the heading ‘Uren Hits at Forced Trade <span class="highlight">Unionism</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Undoubtedly he believed that forced trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> was involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I noted a particular letter which referred to compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, one may be permitted to raise a questioning voice as to the Labor Party attitude on compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Do honourable senators opposite know that  Sir Kenneth  Morris, one of the pillars of the Liberal Party in Queensland, introduced into the State Parliament legislation providing that there shall be compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> or, in other words, preference to unionists? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Preference to unionists is the same thing basically as compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, lt is a back door method of introducing compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is promoting compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> by stealth or back door methods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other day in reply to a question  Senator Cavanagh,  the Minister for Works, said that he does not believe in compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that he believes in voluntary <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe in trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the course of this debate there has been a lot of discussion about compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of speakers, and  Senator Cavanagh  in particular, made the point that they were opposed to compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think  Senator Cavanagh  should have qualified bis remark and explained what he meant by opposition to compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a powerful move in the trade unions to introduce compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in States where Labor was in power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The right wing unions went cold because it was pointed out to them by the legislators that if compulsory trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> was introduced a Bill of Rights would have to be introduced for the individual trade unionists who were forced to join a union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Australian Labor Party and many of the right wing unions decided to oppose compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> by law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other reason that was put forward -  Senator Cavanagh  would know this - was that a number of left wing unions said that if compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> was brought in and people were forced to join unions they would probably be the conservative type and they would vote against the left wing leadership of the union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result was that people like  Senator Cavanagh  and others decided to oppose compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> by law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But of course they are in favour of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> by industrial action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He believes that they should have the power to force a man to join a union by industrial action and yet he says that he is opposed to compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We talked to him on this matter of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said: ‘I do not believe in compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is exactly the view of these noble hearted people on the Labor side who have thumped their breasts and said that they are against compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are against compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> by law because a Bill of Rights to protect the individual unionist would be necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe in <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and I belong to 2 unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has a closed shop policy in relation to trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So much was it nothing to worry about that all the militant unions in Victoria, including the Australian Railways Union, led by  Mr Brown,  the Sheet Metal Working, Agricultural Implement and Stove Making Industrial Union of Australia led by  Mr McNolty,  and the Amalgamated Engineering Union led at that time by  Mr Car  michael came in behind the Federated Clerks Union to enforce compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in the International Harvester Company factory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not really believe in trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, or in enforcing it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It took solid trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> on an industrial basis to force the company into accepting the principle of 100 per cent trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> by stealth and economic blackmail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was quite amazed to hear  Senator Cavanagh,  who must have had his tongue well in cheek, in one instance say T do not believe in compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>’, and then in the next say ‘But I do not believe that a person who is not a member of a union should enjoy the benefits in certain awards’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Cavanagh  on the one hand refers to voluntary <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, but on the other hand he makes it confoundedly difficult for an individual to do other than follow his dictates if that individual is to be eligible for benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now that you have mentioned his name, I remind you that he gained his power as secretary of the Queensland branch because of Australian Labor Party legislation in Queensland relating to compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-It was compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in Queensland, lt was an offence for an employer to employ anybody who was not a member of his appropriate union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All this unrest is based upon the creation of political <span class="highlight">unionism</span> instead of industrial <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are clauses that were the product of a conservative government in the 1920s that had a phobia about trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> simply because an Irishman and a Scandinavian occupied dominant roles in our maritime unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On this occasion - apart from the fact that the determinations applied only to members of organisations which had made application for 4 weeks annual leave - the Public Service Board under the direction of the Cabinet, particularly the Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  was confining the application of these determinations to members of organisations and was, by that method, providing a form of pressure towards compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> on members of the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So much thunder will be heard on the ethics of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> that very little time will be given to the facet of the Crimes Act now under consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole period in which we had a 2i per cent average yearly increase in inflation was a period in which, I remind the Senate, the great trade unions of Australia, through the Australian Council of Trade Unions led by  Mr Monk,  worked on the principle of industrial trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inflation was inflamed on the day when  Mr Hawke  and his left wing brought in this approach to political <span class="highlight">unionism</span> - using <span class="highlight">unionism</span> as a weapon of the aggrandisement, the power politics of union leaders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is clear that the Labor Government will not seek to promote or justify a public interest role if such a role would involve criticism of or adoption of policies not favoured by militant <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Government is threatening to sub ject the combinations of business to the strict rigours of the criminal law, it is providing a freedom of action to the amalgamations of <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in a way which no society which expects its Government to hold the balance between the powerful economic groups in the community can possibly tolerate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By deliberate choice the Government is laying the broad path for the monopoly power of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one couples that identity of purpose in Parliament with unrestrained, uncontrolled and unlimited power on the part of unions to combine to destroy industry, prosperity and employment, outside, one finds a situation in which the contest is between unbridled <span class="highlight">unionism</span>- militant <span class="highlight">unionism</span> - on’ the one hand and parliamenary government on the other and this must come to a real crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All this shows quite clearly to anybody who attempts intelligently to understand that <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, together with all other commerce, can prosper only in a framework of law where the  Tights  of everybody are controlled and regulated according to the rule of law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> has done great things for the Australian worker but today I confess with regret, because I have always supported arbitration, that arbitration is on the way out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We found earlier this year an attempt to introduce compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> by subterfuge by intimating that 4 weeks leave would be granted only tq public servants who were prepared to join trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That may be so; but not everybody is in the position  of being  able, because of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, to increase dues to such a tremendous extent that the increase outstrips even the current rate of inflation in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not think that it is in the interests of <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in this country, nor is it in the interests of employers or the public at large if one can have numbers of employees who simply thumb their noses at an award that is made and say that they can do what they like and are not liable to be dismissed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this matter- a matter which I suggest goes to the heart of <span class="highlight">unionism</span>- is the query: ‘What are we going to get for our labour, under what sort of conditions are we going to work?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendments were made for the purpose of making it more difficult for amalgamation to take place and for effective trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> to operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Conciliation and Arbitration Bill was an enormous Bill, and again it has wide repercussions in the whole field of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and in the relations between the trade unions, industry and commerce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 was amazed to hear what was said on this matter by the doubting Thomases in this chamber because not so long ago when we had several debates on trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> the whole crux of the Opposition’s argument was that there should be little unions and not big ones. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The unions’ trade practices of boycott, black bans, compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and the exercise of power by monopoly of labour, with a consequent restraint on trade, are not only not punishable but are also sought to be justified and removed from examination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before I speak about the general purposes of this legislation I should perhaps make some comments about  Senator Greenwood’s  analogies between the corporate structures of capital and the corporate structures of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, as he called them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The next categories are physical working conditions, trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and other disputes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only one of the 7 categories is trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Bureau’s records the definition of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> includes not only demarcation disputes but also other things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we take the whole of that collection under the heading of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in the statistics for the March quarter of 1974 and for the 2 years prior to that date, we see that 5,085 disputes were recorded and of them 555 came within the category of ‘trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>’ disputes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, 10.9 per cent- almost 1 1 per cent- of the total of those disputes were trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> disputes and demarcation disputes constituted only one section of that percentage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things we learn in trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> is that if we get knocked over verbally a few times we come back to the next meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise that I make all these remarks with a basic belief in the importance of the retention of that for which trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> stands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder about the extent to which a number of problems which we face in Australia the moment in trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> arise from the fact that trade unions are basically occupation oriented rather than industry oriented unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether the sorts of considerations which are set out from page 179 onwards in chapter 12 of the report of the Donovan Commission- the royal commission on trade unions and employers associations conducted from 1965 to 1968 in the United Kingdom- such as of the two types of multi-<span class="highlight">unionism</span> and the problems which arise in trying to make a major change in the basic structure of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> as it has been operating for some time, would indicate that it would be more desirable at least to hear a great deal more public debate taking place in the country, not with a view to destroying trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in any way or for the purpose of union bashing but with a view to asking: How could they fulfil the accepted role more satisfactorily without the sorts of problems which exist and which are exemplified in the approach of the Government, which is saying at the moment that this Bill is necessary to overcome those problems, and the approach of the Opposition, which says that the present provisions will assist in overcoming the problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government and the Australian Labor Party have done a great deal for trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in this country.There is no doubt that from time to time some unions may not agree with everything that the Government has done, but it has been remarkable how over the whole of this century the great bulk of the trade union movement has stuck solidly with the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is just as true in the area of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> as it is in any other area in this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that there is a very significant number of Australians who consider that the Government of this country today is a pressure group representing not even the total forces of <span class="highlight">unionism</span> but perhaps on most occasions only the attitudes of the radical leaders of some of the Australian unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they are interested in the total integration of a great, free Australian society it is clear that advantages are to be gained from having a government educational institution that relates to trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> involved as part of the institutions which have a wider educational horizon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It provides an opportunity for the Opposition to express itself positively in approval of the true principles and purposes of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I think that this Bill demands a thoughtful approach on the principles of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The principles of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> are to enable the employees of the country to organise and gain power from unity for the purposes for which they subsist in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Reference has been made to our system of arbitration and to the place of <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was  Mr Justice  Higgins who in his province for law and order said: ‘The system of arbitration adopted by the Act is based on <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed without <span class="highlight">unionism</span> it is hard to conceive how the Act could have worked.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should have thought that this authority should produce a curriculum, a group of students and staff who would not limit their minds to the mercenary midget considerations that seem to be synonymous in  Senator Georges’  mind with trade union principles, but would go forward from a study of the terrific struggles of trade unionists in past times which are terribly enlightening with regard to the proper purposes of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the challenge that will expose its real merits is if we get purposeful employees pursuing the objectives of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>- that is, by united strength getting better, improved conditions- and not if we have trade unionists whose aim it is to destroy the very system by which they and their families are supported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Anyone who has read the Donovan report on trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in England will know that that country is bedevilled by a multiplicity of unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that one has only to state that those matters are matters that demand real study if trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> is to take a much more acceptable place in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might well be argued that the trade union treasure chest is limited because the traditional role of the rank and file members of trade unions is to endeavour to live in a world of cheap <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>British trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> has thus become a formula for national misery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I believe that my description of the objectives of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in Britain as translated in a practical way is relevant to the tightest scrutiny and interpretation of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The trade unionist in this country has yet to accept the responsibility of paying for good trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, for good trade union officials, for good trade union researchers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A trade union official is a public relations man who has not only to go out and spread the message of <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and the need to become a part of that democratic system but also to front up to those members of the union who refuse to pay their fees or those workers who refuse to join the union and participate in or contribute to the upkeep of the organisation that protects their interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it can get some entry into the areas of tourism and the oil industry that again is to be welcomed because it will mean that organised <span class="highlight">unionism</span> will be participating in the functions of our society and will have a vested interest in the wellbeing of that society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do want to indicate clearly that the aim of the trade union movement to acquire political and economic power remains now, as it did at the beginning, the principal objective of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> owes its beginnings to the economic changes brought about by industrialisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I reject that notion, because while capitalism remains, the role and function of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> will remain essentially unchanged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They were accused of making a secret agreement with retailers to enforce compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, employees were intimidated and the Minister of Labour and Industry was encouraging the breaking of the Industrial Code’ because he is ‘ browbeaten ‘ by industrial leaders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#debate-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is clear from the statements that have been made and it is obvious that we can expect the use of clause 17 and other powers in this Bill to give effect to Labor Party policies in the following areas: Urban and regional development, worker participation, compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, compensation and insurance, import policies, environmental control, standards and efficiency in research, industry restructuring and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>in 24 months’ time Australia could be floundering in the same evil bog in which the British people are at present sinking- a hideous morass compounded of rampant inflation, 5 per cent unemployment, crippling taxation, a huge and rising external deficit, irresponsible, power-drunk <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, near bankrupt industries, business investment at a virtual standstill, declining living standards, a despairing, bewildered people, a helpless Government, a society in disarray. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People often assume that trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and socialism are roughly the same thing; that a trade unionist is a socialist, and vice-versa; and that trade union and socialist activities are designed to secure the same objects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one reads the  Sydney Morning Herald  or the  Australian  one finds that all that the New South Wales Minister for Labour and Industry,  Mr Hewitt,  does is spend his time pontificating on the evils of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It ought to recognise that in the final analysis victory depends upon unionists imbued with that spirit of defence of true trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, with the resource capacity to oppose those with other major resource capacities whose involvement in the trade union movement is to subvert it and to pervert it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the context of civil liberties, I know that if a girl started working at a kiosk there selling newspapers for a newspaper agency, if the union approached her within the first hour some honourable senators would say that that was trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> gone mad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed one would assume that if  Mr Young  meant, by inference, what I have assumed he meant, that he places trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in its traditional role of concern for the development of the conditions of the work force, wages and salaries, a measure of leisure time, how best to use it and how much to have, if these are the circumstances that are indeed basic to the trade union organisation- I believe they are and they are extraordinarily important- then  Mr Young  would regard trade unions as totally subservient to the political views and objectives of the people who lead those very trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Harradine ‘s major criticism seemed to me to be that the Government’s legislation does not require compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, yet that in fact was the very first point under the heading of Organisations’ in the Government’s policy statement issued prior to the election in December 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will pass into law at the whim of this Government a piece of legislation which carries in it this little punishment for a peak council of Australian trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> because of its failure to immediately accept a proposition that was put to it by the Government in May 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The first thing that that legislation set out to do was to encourage non-<span class="highlight">unionism</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The specific purpose of the first part of this Bill as it was originally introduced was to fly in face of that reference and to encourage nonunionism in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Secondly, there was a specific encouragement in the legislation- a financial incentive- to claim conscientious objection from trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This survey also found that only 1 8 per cent thought that trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> should be compulsory and 78 per cent believed that it should be voluntary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Government talks about compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, it must realise that the compulsion if for the good of all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a free university system so far as the government is concerned, and then the union moves in and puts upon the student population extravagant imposts in the way of fees for so-called <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, part of which are to go to indirect political purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are being developed to bring in international <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in conjunction with the operation of the Seamen’s Union of Australia and so put the union out of the reach of national governments, such as the Fraser Government, to control the waterfront adequately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780413_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I was particularly struck by  Senator Chaney  ‘s comments last night when he was talking about trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in the Pilbara. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that if, under the present structure, motions were adopted that contained a Party political stance, it might be said that this was the prostitution of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations aware of widespread Press reports of the utterances of one Miss Barbara Biggs in the last week when she was recorded as saying, among quite a number of other things, that she had been a member of other unions in the past and might again be in the future and that in the proceedings before the Industrial Registrar or his delegate on the conscientious objection exemption matter she was ‘virtually forced to say what she didn’t believe’, namely ‘that all unions and the concept of <span class="highlight">unionism</span> are bad ‘? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As you know compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> violates the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very serious and I hope that it will be a lesson that the officers of the Joint House Department are not just ordinary employers in the sense that they can throw their weight about and perhaps get in their own little pet idea that they can have a non-union man to show their own contempt of <span class="highlight">unionism</span>; but that they have also to consider the smooth running of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Other great works of Liberalism have been the removal of the religious disabilities of nonconformists and Roman Catholics and the abolition of the laws against trades <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then she said that she was not getting any financial assistance at all, that she was simply a conscientious objector to compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How real is her objection to <span class="highlight">unionism</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the ways in which I have been involved in overcoming that problem is through international <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government time and time again has made it very clear that it opposes- as I am sure do the vast majority of the people- actions by powerful unions for political purposes, for demarcation disputes, and to enforce compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-86-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that sometimes some of our writers get caught up on continental literature as distinct from Austraiian trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> is with us in the form of blatant compulsion or is camouflaged under the cloak of preference at the point of employment, or by intimidation of waiverers or by rendering ineffective conscientious or other objection by an obligation on claimants to show cause why they should be allowed the privilege of freedom of voluntary association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person familiar with trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in Melbourne and Sydney would not necessarily know whether a person in the Pilbara area had been a thorn in the side of the mining companies and be able to give a proper evaluation, hence the need for a large panel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most government supporters in the Parliament would agree with me that the principle of <span class="highlight">unionism</span> is extremely desirable, that it is warranted and necessary, and that its introduction over the years has been good for employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, if we are to get Australia back onto the proper financial footing, with inflation levels under control, militant <span class="highlight">unionism</span> surely must be considered its No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if the honourable senator had been fair and had taken a balanced look at the situation he would have gone across the line and examined the militant <span class="highlight">unionism</span> system, which today is making irresponsible raids upon our economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All must agree surely that this is irresponsible <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet there is, naturally, a part for <span class="highlight">unionism</span> to play. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that I agree with <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I can assume is that militant <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in Australia wishes to destroy the economy of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously they can see that there is a future and that militant <span class="highlight">unionism</span> can be defeated not only by the framework of government but also by the employees and the employers in the Australian community playing their part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From time to time, the Government calls into discussions with the Cabinet the leaders of all the cross sections of commerce and industry and indeed of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures on the proportion of total working days lost in 1977 and 1978 one finds that the six categories of causes of disputes are: Wages, hours of work, leave and pensions, managerial policy, physical working conditions and trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the number of working days lost due to industrial disputes caused by managerial policy- not disputes as to wages, hours of work, leave and pensions, physical working conditions and trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>- went from 23.8 per cent to 25.6 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is with a great deal of distress that I see a circumstance arising in which all we are going to achieve is to promote a view from one side that all trade unionists and all trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> are bad things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When elected both in 1975 and 1977, there was no doubt in the mind of anybody who cared to investigate the matter that the Government parties were opposed to the principles of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and would seek where possible to bring about a situation in which membership of any such organisations was entirely voluntary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the appropriate way of dealing with genuine objections is simply to start with the principle of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, if you like, but readily acknowledging the legitimacy of genuine conscientious objection and creating a mechanism, as the University tried to do when this matter first blew up in 1977, which will filter out the genuine cases and allow their position to be respected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been put to me that in the past the Council of the ANU has not showed a great or real commitment to voluntary student <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, although I am reassured by much of what <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
