<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Minister that although some licence is allowed in discussing this Bill - it is a fairly broad Bill - I do not think it covers all aspects of <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I place on record that I believe the majority of Australian people want non-compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, they do not want to see a compulsory theft of their funds for political parties and they want the abolition of preference clauses in awards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of conscientious objection to <span class="highlight">unionism</span> is one which I think is of concern to the whole Australian community as well as to the union- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answer to a question from the honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant)  at Question Time I referred to the number of certificates of conscientious objection to <span class="highlight">unionism</span> which have been issued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ‘call-out’ is the life blood of <span class="highlight">unionism</span> because it is the only weapon with which organised labour can defend itself against the greedy employers and biased industrial commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I wonder whether or not our definition of what is a just cause is being eroded by examples of irresponsible <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the effect of militant trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the end of traditional trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, of course, and it discards all the benefits of regularised labour awards and conditions for payment based on the industry’s profits without any mention of responsibility for productivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> today fails to recognise the detrimental effect on employment when the employers’ problems and costs are ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask him: Has his attention been drawn to a report that a member of (he Communist Party will be a guest  speaker  at a meeting of the Northern Suburbs Branch of the Liberal Party on 20th October next to speak on the subject ‘Modern Aspects of Trade <span class="highlight">Unionism</span>’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I should add that I have heard union spokesmen say that their attitude to conscientious objectors is that if they want to be conscientious objectors they should forgo the benefits which have been achieved by trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely to be consistent the Labor Party must make an exception in the case of conscientious objectors to <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But while it poses as the standard-bearer of conscience, the Labor Party must be consistent in ils attitude to compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today in the South Australian Parliament a censure motion was moved against the Minister of Roads and Transport for taking action to force compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principle of obligatory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> contrasts strongly with the principle enunciated by the Federal Opposition Leader  (Mr Whitlam)  when recently he counselled national servicemen to refuse to serve in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The analogy between compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and compulsory military service is close. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as compulsory trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> is concerned, there is Government legislation on the books in this House which in fact says that in some industries if a person is not a member of an appropriate trade union that person does not work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I deplore the unions’ attitude in relation to compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, because that is what it amounts to, in the retail trade in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that at least one large departmental store in Sydney was threatened just before Christmas by the Transport Workers Union with a denial of supplies delivered to and from that store unless compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> was introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Council directs that employers give preference to local residents in relation to work opportunities; there is compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>; every unionist must obey the rules of his union; and, as the honourable gentleman has mentioned, it is in any one year on which all the financial up the picture of the 4 days in Broken Hill in any I year on which all of the financial members of a union are required to wear their badge on a prominent place on their persons so that the badges are conspicuous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a statistical fact that in this country fewer than SO per cent of people employed in industry belong to a union of any kind although <span class="highlight">unionism</span> is compulsory in many areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, of course, the great  Mr Hawke,  who is supported by the Opposition, is endeavouring to force compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> on all types of commercial enterprises throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members on the other side see fit to use that expression against honourable members on this side when they are talking about compulsory trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is true that such is the case, can the Minister explain to the House where in substance this policy differs from the trade union policy of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> or preference to unionists? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tn terms of the parallel which the honourable gentleman draws, it is news to me that it is the official policy of the Australian Labor Party to support compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, if that is what the honourable gentleman is referring to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the House would be very interested indeed to hear what the policy of the Opposition is on the subject of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, an issue which is of increasing concern to the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand when the same set of rules and the same arguments are advanced by the trade union movement to obtain compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> or preference to unionists in order that all workers in a particular trade or calling equally share the cost of obtaining the best possible wages and conditions Government supporters completely disregard the principle that they have legislated for in the rural sector and raise the hackneyed cry of conscience and the rights of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The machinery of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>^ which has had its. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a member of a trade union and as an active member of a trade union before I came to this place, all I can say to honourable members is this: From my experience of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> the trade unionist was able to get increased wages and better conditions only if he was prepared to take action and to struggle for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is my impression correct that the Australian Labor Party’s revised industrial relations policy has been enunciated against a background of continuing efforts in the trade union movement to increase the incidence of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government certainly is concerned at the increasing trend in recent years by trade unions to take coercive action, against both employees and employers, in relation to compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is certainly true in respect of a number of recent disputes in which employers have been threatened with intimidatory action simply because they have been supplying goods and services to another employer in dispute with a union over this question of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this certainly does not extend to the question of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and, as I have mentioned in response to what the honourable gentleman has questioned, the Government is opposed to compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> because it does cut across individual freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the question of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> does not feature in either the policy of the Australian Council of Trade Unions or the official policy of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, because my time has been greatly taken, I should like to say that while the industrial relations area in the form of the trade unions contents itself with forcing compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> on people, with striking unnecessarily and with isolating States like Tasmania from the point of view of shipping and all that that implies in Tasmania, the situation will not improve in the direction in which I believe the Department of Labour and National Service is trying, in difficult circumstances, to make it improve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stoppages of only 10 man days or more are listed, and they are listed under 4 headings: Wages, hours and leave’; ‘Physical working conditions and managerial policy’; ‘Trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>’; and ‘Other’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> was the cause of 9 per cent of stoppages and the category ‘Other’ 6 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason he gave for its becoming a Country Party State was that there was an absence of industrial <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, an absence of affluence and an absence of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister realise that this kind of cruel and vindictive action on the pari of the Union makes the name of <span class="highlight">unionism</span> hated throughout the countryside when it ought to be respected? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government itself says that nobody is entitled to get the benefit of medical benefit funds or health funds unless he joins a medical benefit fund; and yet here it says that a person can get the benefits of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> without paying anything at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one were to go through the details of the bans that have been introduced in recent times one would see a record of disaster for <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, for government administration and for the community itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although this is not really the occasion to talk about what causes rising prices, we cannot get away from it because this Bill is really a Bill about <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a Bill dealing with what brings into being <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and the efforts of unions to further the interests of their members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the relevant Tribunal refuse an award to the Guild contrary to law and principle and thereby co-operate also in this exercise in compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720411_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-34-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has his Department tolerated and encouraged this exercise in compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> contrary to its well-known professions on the subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720411_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-34-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before turning to a new subject, I want to refer to the proposals as to compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> that 1 outlined in my statement of 7th December last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720426_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let us not think that we can do it Unless we alter the whole approach of <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and the ALP towards what Australia is doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720426_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as a person who is seriously ill does not shop around for the cheapest doctor, trade unionists who want the backing of an efficient and powerful trade union movement cannot afford cheap <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More effective trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> will come through stronger trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From my knowledge of his information and his deep respect for the system of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, I regret to say that I stand here tonight very disappointed that he should have forgotten so much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was very nice to hear the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon),  that lifelong trade unionist leading a party of lifelong supporters of the trade union movement - I noticed them fumbling in their pockets for their union tickets - giving us a dissertation on what trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> is and how trade unionists think and behave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, typical of all renegades, they are the greatest prosecutors of the faith to which they once adhered, and they too realise that the strength of Labor is trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I concede that shop stewards have a very important part to play in <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, but I also believe that a responsible government should do a lot more concerning policy than worry about the activities of shop stewards throughout various factories in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in Australia has developed almost entirely on craft lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Lance Sharkey, the then National Secretary of the Communist Party, in his book ‘The Trade Unions’, made it clear that the purpose is not primarily to bring about economies of scale and an increase of power in industrial relations, but rather to increase the political power of unions as revolutionary weapons - an objective which ought to be alien to trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and which is essentially political and subversive in character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Just as it is very difficult for a government to reform a system of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> within a 3 year term of office, so it is difficult to embark on many valuable projects, especially those that are unpopular in the short term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I need hardly add that the decision by the Government now being considered is most certainly a very tangible reaffirmation of the Government’s high regard for the important role of credit <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in the Australian financial scene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are concerned and alarmed at the backdoor methods whereby the present Government has sought to introduce compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in the Commonwealth Public Service contrary to the explicit mandate of the newly formed Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want the Government to know that the Opposition parties in pursuing their policies will fight to the last ditch in the Parliament in opposing the Government’s desire to seek by compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> to provide some in the Commonwealth Public Service a benefit which it believes might well advantage those concerned but which, of course, completely cuts across the concept of individual freedom and individual liberty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member discussed for a time the vexed question of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are a blatant method of seeking to circumvent established procedures laid down by law for obtaining unproved wages and conditions for employees and they are in fact a further attempt to institute policies of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, in concurrence with its other aims, is seeking, through its approach, and application to advance the concept not of preference to trade unionists but, in fact, of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We condemn the Government for the opportunities which its new procedures provide for abuse and corruption; for the total disregard it has for the community interest and of the concept that programs should be undertaken at the least cost to the taxpayer; for its complicity in forcing the introduction of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, and for its absolute divergence from the principle in the Prime Minister’s policy speech that the Government would stand aside from interference in industry generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party for many years has never advocated compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The only time that compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> was included in the Party’s platform was during the period when the element within the Labor Party which finally broke away to form what is now called the Democratic Labor Party had control of policy making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that then, for a few years, there was provision for compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in the Party platform, but as soon as the Labor Party cleansed itself of this element in the Party it was decided in 1957 at the first conference held after that very happy event that we would alter the policy of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> to one of preference to <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us have no more nonsense about this business of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is, in effect, a policy of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, despite what the Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  who is sitting at the table, said earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another matter I wish to raise concerns compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It appears strange that a government or a party that has been so vehemently opposed to compulsory service in the armed Services should advocate compulsion so far as <span class="highlight">unionism</span> is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is a little unreasonable for the Government to pursue a policy of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> because, let us face it, in the political situation in which we find ourselves - and I do not object to this - funds from the unions go towards assisting the Labor Party to gain the Treasury bench or to assist the Labor Party in the political field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is rather interesting to note that the Government believes in compulsion where <span class="highlight">unionism</span> is concerned but does not believe in compulsion where the defence of this country is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is of no good the Minister for Labour saying, as he has on other occasions, that the determination was not back door compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> brought about by industrial coercion, industrial blackmail and ministerial interference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I could quote to this House decisions of the New South Wales Industrial Commission in 1904 and 1926 and of the Commonwealth Arbitration Commission in the earliest days of its existence, in the early 1900s through the 1920s and the 1930s until this very month, which all say the same thing - that it is one of the chief responsibilities and primary objectives of conciliation and arbitration tribunals and of industrial legislation to encourage the growth of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the introduction of this Bill the Government, in the view of the Opposition, deliberately sought to dishonour an election promise; to introduce the concept and application of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> into the Public Service; to interfere with the longstanding independence and integrity of the Public Service Board; to avoid parliamentary approval of its policy and to set in motion the beginning of its long term design to use the Public Service as a pace-setter in the achievement of the Australian Labor Party’s industrial objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 20th December the Prime Minister issued a statement saying that the first meeting of the Cabinet had decided that the additional leave provisions would apply only to members of recognised unions and associations involved in work within the service; departments, however, would assume that all staff were members unless advised otherwise by a union: provision would be made for conscientious objectors to <span class="highlight">unionism</span> to obtain this new leave entitlement on payment of union dues to a nominated charity; and the new provision would apply to all public servants whose annual leave was accruing on or after 1st January 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition’s objectives in disallowing the Public Service Arbitrator’s determinations were, firstly, to make it clear to the Australian public that an election promise made by the Australian Labor Party was being dishonoured on its election to government and, secondly, to object to the nature of the policy which the Government sought to implement - a policy which was discriminatory, unfair and lacking in merit and substance; a policy which in application would have created a division in the Commonwealth Public Service which was contrary to the interests of this country; a policy which sought to create a group of second-class and under-privileged citizens within the Public Service; and a policy which sought to implement union demands for compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> within the Commonwealth Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In recent months we have heard from various members of the Government Party a series of conflicting views on compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and other speakers in this debate from the Government side surely have an obligation to state precisely what their policy is in relation to the question of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I challenge the honourable member for Phillip  (Mr Riordan)  who, 1 understand, will follow me in this debate, to state precisely what is the policy of the Government relating to compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and put down once and for all a clear statement of Government policy which the Government, so far, has failed to clarify. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of the Government’s actions prior to the disallowance of the determination in the Senate was clearly to establish this concept of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, in the Commonwealth Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One can very easily, by stealth or by overt action, seek the application of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> from an extension of the process of preference to members of the trade union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only reason which compelled the Government to avoid legislating for an additional week’s leave was the desire to introduce the concept of compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> by stealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We support the Bill for the reasons I have mentioned but we oppose the reasons which caused the Government to seek to deal with this matter by subterfuge in seeking to introduce by back door methods a form of policy amounting to compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> within the Commonwealth Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot as a matter of law introduce compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, but we think that the Act, which is our charter, contemplates that we should encourage <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those statements have been totally discredited by the Government’s unconditional endorsement of union demands in the national wage case, Government support for compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, Government backing for industrial concessions in excess of $6,000m per annum, Government manipulation of a labour code and Commonwealth contracts, Government abuse of the Public Service to achieve political objectives, and tacit approval of political strikes directed towards Australian allies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present moves for amalgamation are taking place at the apex of the pyramid of <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and not in fact at its base. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first one was that international trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> holds firmly to the right to strike as a fundamental human freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, we have a Labor Government which fears militant trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, with all the disadvantages that flow from that fear to the great army of trade unionists with common sense and a desire to contribute to their country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why does not the Government stand up to militant trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and say: ‘We will not have this tremendous increase in industrial lawlessness with all the costs it imposes on this nation’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is condoning the action of irresponsible trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> - trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> that stirs up trouble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Under it trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> prospered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only an average of 3 or 4 per cent of all lost time in the years from 1966 to 1970, and under 10 per cent of all strikers are over trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Opposition parties support the concept of effective and responsible trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and we support Australia’s statutory process of conciliation and arbitration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Disputes over union membership have declined rapidly since the Commission’s decision to grant preference to unionists in the clerks’ case, which is a feather in the cap of the honourable member for Phillip  (Mr Riordan),  because employers now know that it is better to accept preference to unionists than to have compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> forced upon them by job action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The low profile strategy was somewhat distorted by the presence in Apia harbour oi HMAS ‘Vampire’ and the Fiji Prime Minister, Ratu  Sir Kamisese  Mara, manoeuvred an internal dispute over Fiji <span class="highlight">unionism</span> into a regional crisis involving Australian trade union interference in Fiji affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the adjournment the court room was invaded by unionists; I presume they were unionists because the banners they carried had words referring to <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because of the inability of the Government to control irresponsible trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> we have an increase in the cost of the manufacture of cartons due to labour costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was not lost over <span class="highlight">unionism</span> or demarcation issues, as the Minister for Labor and Immigration  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  are so fond of saying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to draw attention to some of the cost increases that have been forced upon local government through those honourable members who sit opposite being completely incapable of controlling irresponsible trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The statistics from the Commonwealth Statistician in relation to the same matter indicate that .5 per cent of days lost in the March quarter were lost over <span class="highlight">unionism</span> issues, which include demarcation disputes but not exclusively so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now, the Minister for Labor and Immigration  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  purports to represent <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They draw their members from all walks of life: Scientists, accountants, nurses, engineers and doctors as well as the shearers- I was a shearer before I entered Parliament- seamen and waterside workers who did so much for the development of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-79-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Bureau of Statistics lists the causes of industrial disputes under wage claims, wage matters, hours of work, leave, pensions, compensation provisions, managerial policy, physical working conditions, trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, which includes disputes concerning the employment of non-unionists, inter-union and intra-union disputesin other words, demarcation disputessympathy stoppages in support of employees in another industry and the recognition of union activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is under trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> that we find that demarcation disputes are listed, along with other things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures for the September quarter of last year, which I think are the latest comprehensive figures available, indicate that 87 per cent of the working days lost were lost over wages issues and that 3.5 per cent of the working days lost were lost over trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> issues of which demarcation disputes are but one of several parts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Certainly in the annals of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> his name will be forever remembered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is undemocratic because at the heart of <span class="highlight">unionism</span> is the concept that it is a voluntary organisation of employees joining together for the common cause of seeking wage advantages for themselves and better conditions of work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have yet to understand, let alone hear from the Minister, any good reason why the ordinary rules of democracy should not prevail in this situation, more particularly because so often we hear, and properly so, within the trade union movement in Australia the assertion that <span class="highlight">unionism</span> is one of the most democratic organisations within Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition finds itself in a position of conflict with such wide powers because members of this Government are on the record- particularly in 1973- as saying that the Commission should use its powers to force compulsory trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, to force worker participation and worker control in companies, to set out some pricing policy and to pursue other social policies instead of the time honoured ground of getting the best value for money or the best quality for the least cost in making decisions on an economic basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any confrontation will be the work of those union officials who want to bring down the private enterprise system, because they must know as all Australians recognise that the vast majority of people in this country want responsible trade unions of course, but that the excesses of <span class="highlight">unionism</span> must be rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He could find that in 1973- the first book I grabbed was the 1973 one, but one year is no different from the next- out of 2300 strikes 145 were about something other than wages, hours of work, leave, pensions and compensation provisions, managerial policy, physical working conditions and trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In conclusion let me say also that anyone who has any doubts about the sort of extortion, thuggery and difficulty that has been brought to trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> by this dreadful element in the community should read the two Sweeney reports of 1974 and 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no doubt that militant <span class="highlight">unionism</span> has been one of the contributing factors to the tremendous increase in housing costs- to the extent that now builders’ labourers are paid higher wages than are many skilled tradesmen, especially among metal workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point to be made about this issue is that the argument advanced by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, by  Mr Hawke  and by those in the union movement who advocate compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> is along these lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, from the comments that I have read, I do not accept the proposition that she genuinely does have conscientious objections to trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If people do not have something like trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and the uniform conditions that trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> wins for them, in the competition between each other to get the jobs that are available the whole work force would soon be reduced to intolerable conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> has evolved not because it was forced on the community but because gradually ordinary working people recognised that it was necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that that would lead to a rapid deterioration in many conditions and that it has been only because of trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> that we have developed the way we have in this society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of the work force, 75 per cent did not want compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and 65 per cent of workers said that the average weekly working hours should be kept the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I guess you will remember that when you told me that I know nothing about trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> I retorted that I knew more about the union movement than you would learn if you live for a hundred years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that, despite the limitations of the present leadership, the leaders will not come from the men in the group from the Left who are making such a divisive stand against sensible <span class="highlight">unionism</span> at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-35-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our coal miners have been able to a degree to avoid silicosis and dusted lungs through the activities of sympathetic government and militant trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are trying to force <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and unionisation on the whole of the building industry in Australia, and particularly in New South Wales and, until recently, in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790926_reps_31_hor115/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Industrial action in order to establish trade <span class="highlight">unionism</span> in some places accounted for 4.4 per cent of disputes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the prime rules of <span class="highlight">unionism</span> is being disturbed inasmuch as seniority is not being recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I really think that the truckies’ strike should have been a total anathema to someone with John Laws’ quaint, if very dangerous, right-wing views regarding <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, if only he had had the wit to investigate the underlying rationale of this so-called strike. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Truckies are a group of hard working Australians who have for some misguided reason, consistently eschewed <span class="highlight">unionism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Suddenly the dreaded spectre of the much despised <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, the act of banding together to survive the system and to eke out a fair return on their investment became the panacea to save them from their plight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It goes on to say that it will be running a program to ensure that there is no such thing as compulsory <span class="highlight">unionism</span> and that it will be dealing with a number of constitutional matters that it hopes will be disseminated throughout the schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The thrust of these two Bills - the Australian National University Amendment Bill and the Canberra College of Advanced Education Amendment Bill- represents the Federal Government’s response to the problems of compulsory membership of student organisations, so-called student <span class="highlight">unionism</span>, and the unrepresentative use of student funds from those campuses for which the Federal Government has some sort of legislative responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
