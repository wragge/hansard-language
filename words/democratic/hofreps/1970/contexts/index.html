<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Does Australia recognise East Berlin as  a  territory of the German <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Republic? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Government’s professed military aim in Vietnam to foster <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to inform the House of the following appointments of senators and members to be members of the Joint Select Committee on Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Legislation:  Senator Maunsell  has been appointed by the Leader of the Government in the Senate,  Senator Devitt  has been appointed by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and  Senator Byrne  has been appointed by the Leader of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party in that House;  Mr Jess, Mr Hamer  and  Mr Bonnett  have been appointed by the Prime Minister and  Mr Barnard  and  Mr Crean  have been appointed by the Leader of the Opposition in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On how many occasions in the (a) 1966 and (b) 1969 elections for the House of Representatives were candidates of the (i) Australian Labor Party, (ii) Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, (iii) Liberal Party of Australia and (iv) Australian Country Party on top of the ballot in each State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700918_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister was reported as saying, over the weekend - and I will paraphrase bis remarks - that such political activities as demonstrations and the Moratorium were unnecessary and that we should rely on the ballot box as the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> method. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700923_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What faith can we have in the ballot box or any other <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process when the Government neglects such an emphatic public demand? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700923_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask him whether he has seen an instruction issued to peace marchers by one of the Moratorium organising groups, the Students for <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Action, which says: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he know that the members of that organisation subscribe to peaceful protests in this <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society and would regard the destruction of buildings as a weak form of terrorism if that were their policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701027_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I think that we would all agree that it is not desirable, in the circumstances that the honourable member has mentioned, that pressure of this type should be brought to bear in a country such as Australia where <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles do apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have encouraged the House of Assembly in <span class="highlight">democratic</span> procedures, and we accept the wishes of the House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The person who by any test of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections should hold the post of Prime Minister of Pakistan is being tried and if he is executed it will be extremely difficult for the Government of India to withstand the pressures for an invasion of East Pakistan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What diplomatic and other steps has the Government taken to promote international awareness, discussion and acceptance of the principle of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rule of law at supranational level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-43-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main thing that seemed to upset the honourable member for Grayndler and the honourable member for Fremantle  (Mr Beazley)  was that the motion had been moved in the Senate by a member of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government also give an assurance that any money thus used to buy <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party support will be paid by the Liberal Party and not by taxpayers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Prime Minister inform Archbishop Loane that although Australia’s performance is not perfect it can safely be claimed that we have done better than almost any country in the Western world in attacking these twin problems which are indeed endemic to all <span class="highlight">democratic</span> systems? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720426_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did his predecessor refuse a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> ballot for representation on the Australian Honey Board while approving compulsory secret ballots for trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-35-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he provide a costing of the election proposals put forward at those elections by the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party in each of the last 5 elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-47-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Byrne of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party said this: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What was the total number of appearances by Members who are members of the (a) Liberal Party, (b) Australian Country Party, (c) Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party and (d) Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-39-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Liberal Party, the Country Party, the Australian Labor Party, the Australia Party and the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, are budgeting through their Federal and State bodies for an expenditure of not less than Sim each. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether he would reconcile for me the answer which he gave to that question when he said the Government alone would determine the defence policy’ with the statement made publicly a week or so ago that it was a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process for the Federal Conference of the Australian Labor Party to direct the policies of a Labor government, with particular reference to troop movements from Singapore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the Minister’s apparent acceptance of what he regards as the purported <span class="highlight">democratic</span> direction of the Government by decisions of the Federal Conference of the Australian Labor Party, will he assure this House that in matters relating to defence the decisions taken by the Government will be determined by the Government alone? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thank you,  Mr Speaker,  for the exercise qf this <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process, . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>paid under the act to the Leader of the second nonGovernment party in the Senate.I would add that the Secretary of the Attorney-General’s Department has advised that  Senator Gair  and  Senator DrakeBrockman  can both be paid the additional salary and allowances under the act only because both the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party and the Country Party have equal numbers of Senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What effect will a Liberal-Country Party gerrymander in New South Wales have on the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> proposals of the Australian Government to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act in order to achieve electoral reform by giving, as far as practicable, every citizen a vote of equal value? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Prime Minister not recognise that a continuation of this practice must denigrate the position of Parliament in the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until that time I had not read that article because I had not got beyond page 3 for laughing at the article I read there about the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party takeover of the Country Party in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that many members of the Opposition were elected to this House on Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party preferences? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he give those members of the Opposition who depend so heavily on <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party preferences the opportunity to dissociate themselves publicly as well as privately from the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the last Australian Labor Government played such a prominent role in the establishment of Israel as an independent <span class="highlight">democratic</span> state, will the present Labor Government use its best efforts to obtain a ceasefire and an end to the current hostilities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The use of petitions is a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right of any citizen, but I should like to pay tribute to her for the manner in which she has gone out and worked so hard for something in which she believes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This motion seeks to restrict the Committee stage to from 5.00 to 5.15, and the time for the remaining stages of the Constitution Alteration (<span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Elections) Bill to 5.30. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, there is the question of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Prime Minister speaks of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process or of too many elections, that has a superficial attraction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether it is his view or whether Caucus forced him into it, but when he talks about too many elections or the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process who is going to disagree? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are all concerned about the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Official statistics are only available until the end of August 1973, and indicate that no shipments of galvanised corrugated iron were made in that period to the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Republic of Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I have been informed that, under Australia’s program of Special Aid to Indo-China, a shipment of 760 tons of galvanised corrugated iron has been recently made to the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Republic of Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am unaware of the existence of any commercial contracts for the sale of galvanised corrugated iron to the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Republic of Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the debate on this Bill is resumed I would like to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill, the Constitution Alteration (<span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Elections) Bill, the Constitution Alteration (Local Government Bodies) Bill and the Constitution Alteration (Mode of Altering the Constitution) Bill as they are all associated measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the advocacy of the Prime Minister for the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections referendum based on a genuine belief in the desirability of equality of electoral opportunity, or is it rather a hope that any change might perpetuate a Labor government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also inform the House that I have advised the Governor-General that in respect of the following proposed laws - Constitution Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) 1974, Constitutional Alteration (Mode of Altering the Constitution) 1974, Constitution Alteration (<span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Elections) 1974, and Constitution Alteration (Local Government Bodies) 1974 - the conditions in the second paragraph of section 128 of the Constitution have been complied with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That has been the experience throughout the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> world not only in Australia but also in all comparable countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Did  Mr Ramos  Horta, Leader of the Timorese Social <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Association, visit Australia recently; if so, when. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attacks on the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system which have been made by the Parties opposite, since they were denied what they look upon as their divine right to govern, would cause concern in some of the least <span class="highlight">democratic</span> countries if they occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#debate-82">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A clear campaign is being mounted in this country in the State parliaments and in this Parliament to end <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government for ever in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#debate-82">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) The right honourable member is obviously referring to a speech entitled’Official Secrecy, Open Government and Making Democracy <span class="highlight">Democratic</span>’ delivered by the present Minister for Labor and Immigration on 1 7 September 1 972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Prime Minister provide the House with any further information on the issue of the proper and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> manner in which casual Senate vacancies are filled? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of my amendment, which was seconded by the honourable member for Bennelong  (Mr Howard),  was to allow this Housethe people’s House; a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> House- to express a point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)  is very good at advocating <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes but he is not such a good performer when he gets the opportunity to hold the reins of office, as has been the case in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I also ask him how far he has proceeded in honouring his undertaking to my colleague the honourable member for Prospect on 20 May last year that he would consider the possibility of introducing legislation to ensure that contributors to the funds have a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right to elect directors of the funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A halt must be called somewhere along the line, because what is happening to him could easily be the first step in the erosion of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights of all Australians, which are the same rights that thousands of Australians went away and fought for, and in support of which many were either killed or maimed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I suggested the other day, the important point is that, both in the case of Weimar Germany and in the case of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> Austria in the 1930s, the government was betrayed by its secret police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In both of those cases forces within the secret agencies owed their loyalty either to an old regime or to bodies outside the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole of our purpose in this debate is not to destroy the authority of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> governments but to prevent those sorts of things from happening- to make sure that the secret agencies which we necessarily have to employ but which we regret employing are, in fact, responsible to the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> viewpoints are inclined to be expressed in blacks and whites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, even if the more professional critics of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society are prepared to accept this assessment, there remains the problem of those who protest at being excessively remote from the seats of power and lacking in any influence upon the decision makers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, despite the opportunities for involvement, many are not involved, physically or mentally, with the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Access to an effective education system therefore is vital to a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All will depend for their effective implementation on the maintenance of representative institutions in what I believe is still one of the leading examples of a liberal <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These corporations, of which the IDC will be an Australian forerunner, have been used benevolently and fruitfully by <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialist governments in Italy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, under a Labor Government, the IDC will be used for the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialist purposes I outlined in my policy speech, and the Act which establishes this Corporation will be amended by us to secure those purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in fact, no objections were ever raised inside the departments concerned, then the position is even worse and I would suggest that they use the method of a not excessively <span class="highlight">democratic</span> organisation - the Roman Catholic Church during the last few centuries - and employ a devil’s advocate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is essential if we are to have an active democracy viable enough to stand up against anti-<span class="highlight">democratic</span> pressures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialist, however, no member of the Australian Labor Party, could be content wilh a vision which merely envisaged the ever-growing production of goods, even if those goods were more equally shared. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>And there is another way, the way of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> and constructive method, of reason, education and responsibility, of the encouragement of racial, inter-racial and multiracial co-operation and of the denial of violence and force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the effect on his audience was that of a great man coming to support their movement when they were still at the bar of world opinion for having used violence on their own countrymen, their own revered leaders who had committed no other crime than that of trying to represent their people democratically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, it was an abortive move in the sense thai the election for which the Prime Minister was preparing was vetoed by the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sir, democracy is a faith, not a formula, and freedom in expressing intelligent opinions can only protect democracy and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This situation persisted through the course of the election campaign despite repeated efforts by the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party to coerce the Prime Minister into an aggressive defence stance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 deplore the fact that when my own political party, the Australian Labor Party, is kept out of power for so long by a government coalition of so-called Liberal Party, Australian Country Party aud Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party interests using, let us admit it, so often fear and smear tactics, imputing a lack of patriotism and engaging, as we saw tonight, in other untruthful methods to gain their ends, the needs of the people suffer so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only is there our tradition of a stronger caucus system with leadership involving the ordinary member far more than with our opponents in the process of decision making, but also ours is a mass party which is built on <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise the need to improve the processes of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system because I recognise the present dangerous gulf between a relatively small and unrepresentative Cabinet which wields almost total power and the rest of the Parliament - and indeed the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If in discussing the needs of Australians in this first year of the 1970s I have emphasised to this point economic subjects, this is not so much because this is the area of my particular training but mainly because I consider that maximum growth through sensible economic planning is the key to achieving that other worth while objective of those of us who believe in <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, which has become the second string of the Liberal Party, manipulates this flaw in the electoral system of choosing for marginal seats candidates whose names begin with A or B, thus ensuring that those candidates are first on the ballot paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Socialisation of Industry, Production, Distribution and Exchange - to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation and other antisocial features in those fields - in accordance with the Principles of Action, Methods and Progressive Reforms set out in the Party Platform from time to time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I return to the second paragraph of the Labor Party’s platform, headed ‘Interpretation of <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Socialisation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the noisy honourable member opposite who persists in interjecting that the word ‘<span class="highlight">democratic</span>’ before the word socialisation’ in the Party’s platform does not mean a thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding this, we have the word of  Mr Joe  Chamberlain that the word ‘<span class="highlight">democratic</span>’ before the word ‘socialisation’ does not alter one iota the terms of Labor’s objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the essence of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government that State governments should have more responsibility than they have in relation to the raising of the moneys which they spend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the committee consist of eight Members of the House of Representatives appointed by the Prime Minister, six Members of the House of Representatives appointed by the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, four Senators appointed by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, three Senators appointed by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and one  Senator appointed  by the Leader of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that open inquiry is one of the fundamental requirements in the search for truth and in <span class="highlight">democratic</span> behaviour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very few of the 60 or 70 parliaments associated with the InterParliamentary Union are <span class="highlight">democratic</span>, open, deliberative and consultative assemblies in the way they should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable members are a long way from being <span class="highlight">democratic</span> in their operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at a lot of the evidence that has been given about Vietnam we will see that a man who previously was the greatest hawk in the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Government of the United States is now not only the greatest dove but is speaking in a way that is completely contrary to the attitude that he had taken in the previous government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Now that the Minister is a convert to <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Socialism, is he planning to promote some other government or semi-government institutions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister is spokesman for the only <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government in the world which would now dare depict the war in Vietnam and its origins exclusively in terms of external aggression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Knowing how anxious the Prime Minister now is to ingratiate himself with the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labour Party, other nations place sig nificance on the statement by  Senator Gair  to the National Press Club last October that the Government should examine the possibility of a naval arrangement with South Africa for defence in the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society can long survive half-alienated, and in the United States alienation is deepest among the very groups upon whose co-operation and dedication <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society most depends - the young, the educated and the idealistic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (2) The Australian Government does not recognise the so-called German <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Republic, nor, therefore, any territorial claims it might make. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We regret what we did last night, but unless the Government changes its attitude towards this <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institution and this democratically elected Opposition there will be more incidents like last night’s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is increasing evidence that the Labor Party in and out of Parliament is set on a course of defying the whole structure of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Disruption and disorder in this Parliament was his policy and the policy of members of the Country Party when they sat in the corner of this chamber and did everything possible to stop the workings of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government of that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at the same time I could not let go unchallenged this great reform speech tonight which brought tears to my eyes, and I thought of this great man crying for a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institution and crying for approaches to be made to politics here when in his day he would have laughed at them if they had been brought up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor movement in this country will forever fight for the things that are <span class="highlight">democratic</span>, be they demonstrations against Vietnam or injustices to those on the farms who are demonstrating today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be, I think, fair to say that the man who established the Liberal Party, and who in fact created and led it with some distinction for a number of years, would be mortified to see the way that Party is traducing the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles of the Parliament that he respected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the principles of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> procedure in the Parliament is that we are allowed to do precisely that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let them be honest enough to say that this is the proposition they want to put forward, because it will make it much simpler for all the elected members to return to their electorates where they can be doing useful work and not wasting the taxpayers’ money by sitting in this chamber just aborting the very work of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes of elected government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt in my mind at ali that, after having been here for a short time, the whole fabric of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government, as I understand it, is being eroded consistently and effectively by the Government, which talks in pompous terms about law and order when it knows very well that the plain, simple, political fact is that, no matter what they do, no matter whether we behave or misbehave, it can still gag anything we want to say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 would suggest to the Government that it reassess and make a re-appraisal of what it considers to be the role of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> Parliament, particularly as it applies in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is how <span class="highlight">democratic</span> it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, this Government says that it is <span class="highlight">democratic</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope also that what I say will be heeded by people in places of political influence who, by virtue of that influence, may be able to persuade others not to embark upon or persist in a course of conduct calculated to damage the great interest we all have in maintaining a stable <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society ruled by law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In approaching this problem, one must first consider what conduct is permissible in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society on the part of those who wish to see a change in Government policy or a change in the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Three years after he had won the largest majority of votes accorded a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> leader, not only in the history of the United States but in the history of the world, he had to announce his abdication. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet in all these years of America’s agony at home and abroad, despite the near disruption of her society, despite demonstrations by the scores, despite the demoralisation of the world’s oldest and democracy’s largest organised political party, the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Party of the United States, no responsible leader or organ has ever effectively charged that Communists were behind the dissenters or even significantly among them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Demonstrations, peaceful demonstrations, are as legitimate and as necessary a part of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes as elections themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not true that if such a group as the Students for a <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Society should endeavour to blockade the street, as has been suggested, there will be panic? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view, we should ask questions about our so-called <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must recognise that Parliament is only a part of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that he has been in the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the Australian Country Party, but I do not think the Communist Party has been able to find room for him in the telephone box in which they meet in his electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Leader of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party comes to an education or migrant meeting - although I deplore most of his politics - I will stand beside him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the challenge of a modern <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society is this: The government has to be responsive and responsible to the governed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the long history of human endeavour we have been unable to resolve this <span class="highlight">democratic</span> problem of making a society responsible to the will of its citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Attorney-General made a great play of the term ‘a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But how <span class="highlight">democratic</span> is Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How <span class="highlight">democratic</span> is section 78 (2.) <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would you find that in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are those provisions symbols and actions of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer is because the Conciliation and Arbitration Act includes some of the most undemocratic clauses on the statute books of any <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ours is not a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not true that Australia is <span class="highlight">democratic</span> in the sense in which we think of the word. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is there any honourable member of the Country Party or <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party who will come to Melbourne on 8 th or 9th May and debate with us somewhere publicly the very issues that we are discussing here tonight? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So the Vietnam Moratorium is not only about the Vietnam war but it is about those things that make a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society tick - the right of freedom of association and the right of freedom of assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I accept - perhaps others do not, and I could not care less - the principles of free speech in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society, but I am against the use of sincere people for political purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know Martin Posa and I see no reason to disagree with that view because the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party expressed it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>South Vietnam snuffing out the hope of freedom and of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> independence in that country and extending the areas of Communist control closer to their country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I want it to be a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process; I want it to be a peaceful process; I want it to be an inoffensive process; and I want to be in Melbourne on 8th May to do everything I can to make it into these things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the situation that we see arising here is one which sooner or later we must begin to develop - whether we are the government or honourable members opposite are the government - if this place is really to become a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He would have renegotiated the AustralianUnited States base agreements so that - and here is his fairy tale - Australia would have been able to settle down in an almost Utopian situation where it could implement the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> Socialist policies of the Australian Labour Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the important basic purposes of credit unions is to provide <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes and practices by which people can have a say in the regulation and deployment of their collective savings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In small establishments, such as banks, electricity authorities or retail organisations, these processes and obligations are undertaken with the utmost seriousness and a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> practice operates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To require the credit unions to have a large amount of capital in excess of $50,000 obviously has the effect of defeating the basic <span class="highlight">democratic</span> purpose of the movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is part of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process that we should have codes which are readily accessible to all citizens as distinct from relying increasingly on judge made laws which mean that citizens have to ask lawyers to tell them what the law probably is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In any event, he has a right to make a free political choice within our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society, that is, to exercise certain liberties and freedoms which inherently belong to an individual within a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite wrong and repugnant to anyone who holds <span class="highlight">democratic</span> concepts that a man’s political beliefs should be used as the issue which allows him to be held to ransom for something which he greatly wants to achieve; that is, Australian citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As K found in all of Kafka’s writings, he was shuttled from minor official to minor official, always skirmishing on the periphery but never really quite reaching the heart of where the decisions were made, never quite reaching where he should be entitled to reach as a citizen within a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society, to put his case for his rights within a society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Frankly, from a Socialist point of view - and I claim to be a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> Socialist - our scheme is not a radical scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the AttorneyGeneral: Is it a fact that members of the Ustashi, the Nazi Party, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the Australian Country Party and the regimes of Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa and Saigon are united in their spontaneous support of the invasion of lndo-China by some of Australia’s allies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In those circumstances and in that environment we will find <span class="highlight">democratic</span> Socialism taking on the iron fist of authoritarianism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Progress is being made in this direction but the progress is being slowed down to this end by the very fact that some people are not prepared to back up the troops and those who are endeavouring to create a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society in South Vietnam in order to allow its people the expression of freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Vietnam Moratorium campaign is an assault upon <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes, based on fraud and designed to promote widespread disruption and dislocation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To show the nature of this so-called <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government in South Vietnam, which this Government supports, let me refer to some particulars given in answer to a question which I directed on 27th September 1967 to the then Minister for External Affairs,  Mr Hasluck. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are, therefore, seeking to change Australian policies by demonstration and this is not part, and should not be part, of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In truth, the Moratorium Campaign is aimed at the heart of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But this again is not a part of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process, and it should be noted that the honourable member for Lalor time and time again has advocated this breaking of laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The shadowy shadow Minister for Health who supports the Bill yet indulges in an orgy of selfjustification by paying lip service to the hopeless hypothesis which Labor hopes lo pass off as a health scheme proudly labels himself as a <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Socialist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is based not on some high flown <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Socialist ideology - or whatever the honourable member for Oxley calls his Party’s alternative scheme - and not on some hideous hybrid mutation in the minds of those who would hopefully pluck for indiscriminate transplant here, aspects of overseas health schemes which appeal to them; it is based on the facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is completely contradictory to the whole tradition of democracy and the law making procedure upon which the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process is based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as I have pointed out, calling for a change in the Government’s policy not through the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> procedures, not through an amendment to the law, not through peaceful demonstrations and not through letters to the editors of newspapers or any of the normal channels of communication which are used in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country but through what is clearly admitted to be an open breaching of the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>ls this the extent of my <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Have any approaches been made to the Commonwealth Government by persons in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, South Vietnam, the Philippines, South Korea or Taiwan or in communist countries for diplomatic, military or other help in defence of their <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights; if so, willi what result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If approaches have been made, can he say whether the Governments of any of these countries, and which, have restricted <span class="highlight">democratic</span> freedoms of political opponents not engaged in armed rebellion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  can assure the honourable member that that will be the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way in which this Government will formulate its policies; not as a result of marches in the streets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only criticism was that it was too timid and that it was not the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialism that the honourable member for Lalor would like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am speaking as one who accepts the general proposition that from a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> point of view the Govern nent of South Vietnam is preferable to that of North Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When they are watching or participating in the jockeying for position regarding who will be the next leader of the Liberal Party I hope that they will give the highest priority to the question whether the contender has faith in or contempt for the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would indeed be interested to hear the Minister indicate on what possible <span class="highlight">democratic</span> basis he could advocate that sort of proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would express my opposition to him but I would do so according to the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that ere this day is out the Government will be out of office following the carriage of a resolution that stands for the very principle of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we value the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process - I think we do and I hope we do - and if we accept the benefits that flow from that process, this being the very reason for the existence of this House, we must fight to preserve these values because without values and without honour our society is empty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember very well the way in which my predecessor was repudiated by the Prime Minister purely for the purpose of mollifying the opposition being received from the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party and to gain the support of that Party in the last federal election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On the basis of the first portions of both amendments I submit that under no rules of debate or any precedents that have been established in any <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institution can the amendment moved by the honourable member for Casey be accepted as a proper amendment to the initial amendment moved by the honourable member for Dawson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that those honourable members opposite who wish this House to continue as a House of Parliament operating in a democracy in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way should take note of what is contained in the first portions of the 2 amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has encouraged the Government in the setting up of this facility because, as it has said, this facility will help it in its <span class="highlight">democratic</span> Socialistic activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In short, under a Labor government, the IDC will be used for the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> Socialist purposes <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that, in this instance, we have taken from the policy of the Australian Labor Party - and this was outlined by the Leader of the Labor Party in his policy speech for the last election - this <span class="highlight">democratic</span> Socialist weapon and we are paving the way for the Labor Party to implement its policies on <span class="highlight">democratic</span> Socialism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the Government is unable to interfere, even if it subscribed in every way to the claims of the nurses, because this is the whole process of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On this side of the House we believe that these aims of industrial development, hand in hand with desirable social changes and the preservation of the environment, can be achieved only by <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>lt does not really get anywhere near solving all the problems the multi-national corporation brings to Australia; but it is a good start for a future <span class="highlight">democratic</span> Socialist government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so, will the Government consider the introduction of legislation to increase the size of the Senate by an additional two Senators for each  Stale  and thus provide opportunity for an increase m the size of the House of Representatives by twenty-four Members lo ensure continued adequate <span class="highlight">democratic</span> representation for Our continuously growing population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the second reading debate on this Bill there, the spokesman for that Party - which is the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party - had this to say in relation to the clause under consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I propose to show the sheer hypocrisy of the arguments advanced by the members of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Government and to the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Parry which is represented only in the other place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party did not initiate those ideas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Little  continued, after indicating why members of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party would not support the amendment, by saying this about  Senator Poke  who moved the amendment on behalf of the Opposition in the Senate: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The members of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party voted with the Government against the ideas that  Senator Little  had expressed previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So, how can he understand a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institution in which policies flow from branch to conference to the parliamentary party and to the executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I made a remark on one previous occasion in this House to the effect that the great privilege of freedom of the Press is treated by the Press very lightly and I made the point that in authoritarian countries the difficulty is to suppress the truth but in our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> countries the difficulty is to have the truth reported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Trie plea everywhere is for more participation in the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process; let participation begin at home, right here, in the national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any change of forms of procedure for dealing with legislation must take account of this reality and must not in any way inhibit the political confrontation which is part of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> and constitutional process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government genuinely wishes to reduce the level of unrest which exists in our community and genuinely wishes to earn the respect of the people of Australia it should cease immediately its politicking with their feelings and try to determine the real cause of the unrest, seek solutions where they are able to be sought and come into this Parliament and tell the nation that it is tackling the problems of the nation in a responsible manner and a manner which is befitting of a government in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since the Minister may have been alarmed by  Mr Gregory’s  intention to participate in the Vietnam Moratorium, although his major purpose was to play the campus circuit of university unions as the guest of those unions and the Wayside Chapel, I ask the Minister whether he is aware that  Mr Gregory  called off his plans to disrupt the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> National Convention 2 years ago with the statement: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On April 15, Dick Gregory called  a  news conference in Chicago  to  announce that he was dropping plans for demonstrations  at  the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> National Convention, because in view of the temper of the Negroes and the ‘ethnic’ groups there  was  no  way to  insure against civil violence on  a  scale heretofore unknown in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The watch word of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> freedom led only to insecurity, undiscipline, and at length to the downfall and destruction of all authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it achieves its objectives, this country will not be the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country which we are all determined it should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not so very many weeks ago I had occasion to hear an expression of the personal philosophy of some of those who belong to Students for a <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, this system has been augmented by a recent decision taken in the Senate, where the numbers are now equal in some respects because the Opposition and the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party find that by combining they can outvote the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that Parliament ought to be the central institution in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that this type of attitude is absolutely deplorable and, more shamefully, not only does this reflect the low regard in which these people hold members of Parliament but also it shows that they deserve condemnation because they have so much contempt for the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system under which this country works. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After it that Government said: ‘Democracy and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> parliamentary government are now established in South Vietnam’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 149 and to my rational, sane request for a rational, sane description of how a democracy works, how one asseses it and how one finds out whether it is more <span class="highlight">democratic</span> or less <span class="highlight">democratic</span> than a Communist regime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are in Vietnam for a very specific and clear purpose, and that is to give these people the right to determine their own future by <span class="highlight">democratic</span> vote according to Asian ideas of what democracy really means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the only mistake we can make is to say that judged through our eyes they have not got what we call a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If any member of the Labor Party wishes to continue this debate I would like him to tell me of any other nation in Asia which is more <span class="highlight">democratic</span> than South Vietnam is today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that those people who are so enamoured of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> progress that is being made in South Vietnam start to read some publications on this subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest to the honourable member that he should have another look at the figures for the Chisholm by-election and ask himself how the combined Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party and Liberal vote, which represented approximately 61 per cent of the total votes cast in Chisholm 9 months ago, has dissipated to 53 per cent in a very short time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700922_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In all fairness, in this <span class="highlight">democratic</span> age, why is it that the Prime Minister can make such a decision as will affect so many people to their detriment and not have sufficient courage to say what is really intended? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700922_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Would he consider it even more serious to reject the authority of the commanders of Australia’s defence forces than to spread disaffection for <span class="highlight">democratic</span> authorities among the body politic, as has been advocated? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within the limits of this speech, the foregoing is an over simplified exposition naturally, but it is at the practical root, I believe, of the Government’s disinclination to impose target dates, and that accounts for its policy - which is correct, in my view, on both philosophical and pragmatic grounds - to expedite development throughout the Territory so that, when the people determine for home rule, there will be, first, some prospect of a national outlook; secondly, some prospect for cohesion against secession movements - there are at least 4 active in Bougainville, the Gazelle, the Highlands and Papua - and personal ambitions for leadership, but perhaps they can form together a federation; and, thirdly, some prospects of government under a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system rather than relapse into army or political dictatorship under some strong man, a few of whom can be seen today striving mightily with the cry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the residents and the Gazelle councillors were concerned here was the alternative Prime Minister of Australia giving Labor Party support for an organisation which had run against <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government, beaten up influential leaders of the Tolai people, refused to pay taxes duly levied by the Gazelle Council and drained the Central Treasury, because of police actions, of money vitally needed for general development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggested he should stand for election to the House of Assembly in 1972 because I believe, rightly directed within the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process, his talents could prove a valuable contribution to his country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has no room for conscience because he imagines that he and his Government and the forces behind it are so ultimately <span class="highlight">democratic</span> that there is no need or room for conscience in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion there is no more important issue confronting this Parliament and this country because it is a question of the future of government, the future of authority and the future standing  of  a  government in Australia, whether  it be Liberal, Labor or anything else, which has been elected by <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose one could go through the history books and discover many instances of individuals who have advocated anarchy or mutiny or treason, but I would say that this surely must be the first time in history when, in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country, the leader of a party which regards itself as close to being in a position to form a Government elected by <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process has advocated a course of disobedience of and disregard for the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian people have a long history of supporting and accepting the laws made by the democratically elected Government of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The laws have not always been easy or pleasant laws for many of the people to accept but the Australian community has shown a responsibility towards the maintenance of the rule of law over the last 100 years, a record of respect for laws democratically arrived at I would say there is no better record to be found in the world than the record we have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure the Australian public will not have a bar of a political leader or a political party which has shown contempt for the law and the due processes of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government and has openly preached law breaking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we are witnessing today is a government that is prepared to design a system of spying and surveillance in modern, <span class="highlight">democratic</span> Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ls it possible for the law (not all hut some or one) passed by a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government to be unjust? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are people who argue that a fairer and more <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system should be devised and perhaps some system of proportional representation could be devised for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first past the post system, which is advocated by honourable members opposite, is obviously unfair and undemocratic when one looks into it because minority groups in the community would virtually be disfranchised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My argument based on this simple illustration is that if we are to have at some future time a change in the method of voting let us have a fair and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system and one which will truly give a proper reflection of the wishes of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are going to argue that way about <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes we have at least to be consistent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I say, it is a piece of national humiliation; if is selectively unjust and ought not to be tolerated by a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> parliamentary system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In one dispute my own union, the Boilermakers and Blacksmiths Society of Australia, was fined a few thousand dollars because it refused to revoke a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> decision to limit overtime to 12 hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The basic concept that all within a given local authority area are both taxed and represented is a fundamental <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It wins Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party preferences for the Government and I supect that that is now the Government’s real war aim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been brought about because we have been free to pursue our policies and our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government without fear of threats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, in the United Kingdom under the Labor Government it was found that between I I per cent and 14 per cent of households were at poverty level and it increased during the period that the Labor Government - the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Socialists - had power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How this is to be achieved must remain one of the greatest challenges to <span class="highlight">democratic</span> parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the great majority of cases, open and fair reporting leads to a more informed public opinion from which our representative <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government system can function better, lt is an important element of democracy that a continuing striving for improvement in communication exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the very limited time at my disposal in this debate I want to refer to a point which is of very great concern to all members of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We finish up with the motto - this could well apply to honourable members opposite but not to any <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institution such as the Australian Army - that they are required to live up to, namely, constant vigilance, eternal suspicion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Condamine has water in it only once a year and then for only a very brief period, so it does not make great demands on one’s <span class="highlight">democratic</span> values. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mow could the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party have done it without the resolute stand taken by the vast majority of senators in Opposition, namely those from my own Party, the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think anybody ought to be proud of legislation validating in retrospect what has already been collected in many cases, what has been sent in to State stamp duty offices in other cases under protest, and in still further cases what is awaiting the decision of this House as to whether it has to be sent in in the form of duties from 18th November, when the Hamersley case was first decided, to 30th September, the date decided by that other partner in the present Government coalition, namely the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unlike the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, we are not doing deals in any corridors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I conclude by stating that I hope there will be a change of heart by the other Party in the coalition, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, and that its members will not allow us to tag on to them the responsibility which will be theirs for seeing that this tax is collected even up to 30th September. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can only reflect while he was talking about this matter that he regretted that the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party had sufficient influence apparently to make with the Government some arrangements which were of advantage to some of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the Government, having made its decision to go ahead with this legislation when it first came before this House, should not have succumbed to the political blackmail of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party in the Senate, whose main objective was to preserve the political life of the DLP representative in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, the experience of its own people in office, of <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Socialist parties in office, makes it quite clear that the Opposition has a love of inflation which this Government has not had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701027_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I understand it, the proposed changes to the legislation to alter the Council come about as a result of a request by students or other groups within the university to make the Council more <span class="highlight">democratic</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am afraid 1 have come to the conclusion that the only reason why this battalion was dispatched in the last week or so is that the Government is afraid of its <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party allies and that it wanted to guarantee continued support of DLP second preferences at election times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710219_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party represents a very practical example of the manipulation of the preferential voting system and the election of minority governments, lt claims to be a Labor Party, picks candidates where possible to be first on the ballot paper and allocates its preferences to non-Labor candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This in fact indicates support for the ‘first past the post’ system where a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> election would have given the people the candidate of their choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>‘First past the post’ voting is not the be all and end all of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections, but by the introduction of one-vote-one-value and the introduction of this system it is reasonable to assume that governments elected will be those chosen by the majority and not, as Malcolm McKerras described this Government, as ‘a second preference government’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But we all know that in recent times certain political parties, notably the so-called <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, have chosen candidates with names which would put them ahead of a Labor candidate on the ballot paper in order that voters’ preferences may have been directed towards Government candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a vital and fundamental principle of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710402_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe this has been the attitude of  Mr Anthony  in association with the third partner of the ramshackle coalition - the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party - which has prevented the implementation of that decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those imposed in conformity with the law and which are necessary in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society in the interests of national security or public safety, public order, the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the few anti-<span class="highlight">democratic</span> violent minorities get away with it, then the rights of all legitimate dissenting minorities are endangered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It thus safeguards our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institutions and enables them to continue to evolve creatively to the ultimate benefit of individuals, for to the liberal a person’s life is his most important possession and it is of the utmost significance how that life is lived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I and of fundamental importance in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in the exercise of his rights everyone shall bc subject to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing recognition nf the rights of others and of meeting the requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is little doubt that in Australia, as in other <span class="highlight">democratic</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>countries, some of these threats to law and order and safety are the work of subversive elements who are adept at using <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes for their own ends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the right of dissent is one of the features that distinguishes <span class="highlight">democratic</span> countries such as Australia from oppressive dictatorships, there are some people in the community who abuse this <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no excuse for this in a community in which changes of the law can be brought about by peaceful processes through the channels of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I say again that I believe it is most reprehensible for any member of Parliament or anyone in a position of authority to influence younger people in particular to break the law when there are, as the article 1 just quoted states, <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes for obtaining this objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is something which is very dear to any <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, in my opinion it is the basis of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system and the process of law as we know it in Australia today, and we certainly want to maintain the position which has existed over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole process of law is something which we must at all times continue to observe, if we want freedom and a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely if we are to live under a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system we should have a law which will protect people’s property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system we will <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We .value our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system in Australia! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is the Government’s .responsibility to ensure that our <span class="highlight">democratic</span>, system is maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate that differences of opinion are often expressed in this House between the Government and the Opposition as to the best method of maintaining our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least we should give them the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right to express their views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the point of view of the Opposition we are particularly concerned about people demonstrating for their <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights in respect of legislation for which there is no mandate, particularly from the trade union movement when demonstrating against injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is he going to tell me that Queensland is <span class="highlight">democratic</span>, with Premier Bjelke-Petersen running it the way he does and representing nobody as he does, or that Victoria is <span class="highlight">democratic</span> with  Sir Henry  Bolte who cannot even get an absolute majority in his own electorate running that State? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I particularly will reject for myself and in any way I can those provisions of it which place upon the lower courts powers of imprisonment, which I do not think they ought to have, and which place in the hands of officials, whether it be the Attorney-General, a police sergeant or someone else, the right to decide whether a case will proceed or not and the right to decide on some of our fundamental and absolutely inalienable <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I doubt whether there is any member of this House who would not agree that one of the fundamental <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights is that of dissent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, <span class="highlight">democratic</span> authority is identifiable and often identified and responsible to an electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are faced with a fundamental difficulty in our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But one of the weaknesses of this permissiveness and of the liberalism of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way of life- certainly as expressed in this country - is that it does not crack down on those who are not playing the game. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be possible, under this legislation, for a diplomat from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to be offended if he were present or in the vicinity when the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  or the Leaders of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party next make an address at celebrations of ‘Captive Nations Week’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are the sorts of phrases used continually by such great <span class="highlight">democratic</span> newspapers as ‘Pravda’ and ‘Izvetsia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When this Bill was debated in the Senate it was quite obvious that the Government would be defeated because the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party objected to this period of 5 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has said that if the period were  5  years the chances of a rural producer having to go to court were remote, but that now that the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party has forced it to accept this amendment and make the period  3  years, it may not be able to be so lenient and an offender may have to go to court and take the consequences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, because the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party in the Senate was opposed to the  5  year period, this compromise period of  3  years has been selected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, there is an essence in this argument that someone, if I can put it in the vernacular of the Opposition, who is a bludger on his mates, someone who is a scab on a union - whether he be a Tasmanian or the original founder of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party of Australia or anything else is beside the point - someone whom the Opposition inherently should distrust should be caught before he, and again to use the vernacular of the Opposition, succeeds in bludging on his mates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite argued strongly that the period should be 5 years but, because the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party in the Senate objected, they reduced it to 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When this Bill went to the Senate an amendment to the clause providing for that 5-year period was passed because the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party voted with the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Amendments to this Act were rushed through Parliament in I960, as a matter of extreme urgency, to protect us from threats to our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only use that has been made of this Act has been to limit the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights of our public servants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When will the Government cease to provoke people of conscience who wish only to express themselves in what they believe to be a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> manner in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have used the terms ‘democracy’ and ‘<span class="highlight">democratic</span>’ very loosely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every honourable member on the other side of the House should bear in mind that what distinguishes a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society is not the extent of public order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What in fact distinguishes a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society is the freedom and tolerance that the society gives to individuals and groups to think as they see fit, to feel as they choose, to express their views as individuals, to organise together as groups in assemblies, to express their views in order to publicise those views and to change government thinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the characteristics of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Government has done in this Bill has been to say that there are two factors - the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights of individuals and public order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no truth whatsoever in the claim which is often made by supporters of the Government, and which lies behind this sort of Bill, that a government is <span class="highlight">democratic</span> purely by virtue of the fact that it happens to represent majority thinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society cannot subordinate so grossly the rights - of individuals and minorities, as the Government does through this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Order and liberty are the basic elements in the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> dichotomy and it is both wise and necessary to keep the balance under constant review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such an assembly, if a peaceful one that does not cause harm and danger to other people, must be the very essence of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society, but there is no guarantee in this Bill in relation to such assemblies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want a situation in which we can listen to the minority point of view because 1 regard the right to express a minority point of view as of prime importance in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That incident itself was a form of demonstration against national service and involved the  right of young people to express their opposition to government policy, a right which should be accorded to all people in any <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are provisions in that Act which are a disgrace not only to this Government but also to this country and which would be a disgrace to any <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a most dangerous situation because it can be guaranteed that with powers like this it will be possible for agents provocateur, for members of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, members of the Nazi Party and for other extremists of the right or, in other cases, extremists of the left, to cause violence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labour Party, members of the Nazi Party or members of any extremist right wing group whose aim is to destroy an assembly? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For too long we have reacted emotionally to massive campaigns depicting the downward thrust of China, of technicolour <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party and Government propaganda of the Red threat oozing over South East Asia and dripping on to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That was why the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> procedure was finished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>even begin to assess Chinese policy, and the ridiculous debates in this House because the Government can get the preferences of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party by yak-yak-yak about Red China are a disgrace to this Parliament and would be unacceptable in a high school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AH major political parties - the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the Country Party and <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party - say they are opposed to these policies, but with the exception of the Labor Party none of them is prepared to make even a token gesture towards helping to change them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Prime Minister further: Is he aware that in South Africa there is practically 100 per  cent freedom of the Press and religion, that passports for departure from the country are freely available, that there is a fair judiciary and that there are other signs of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> freedom? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the honourable member for Bradfield  (Mr Turner),  the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  and honourable members on this side of the House have said so adequately, eloquently and continuously today, we are departing so serously from the traditions of general parliamentary government and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights that, we are putting the Parliament itself in a hopeless position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I pause on occasions such as this and consider the operations of the majority of honourable members opposite and the thoughtless and discourteous way in which they proceed with their functions, I see how hopeless is the position of those people who do not live in <span class="highlight">democratic</span> communities such as ours where there are some traditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is clear that there will be a repetition of what happened yesterday when the Parliament sat through the early hours of the morning until 6.30 a.m. Noone could seriously suggest that this is the way a responsible Parliament should act in a so-called <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Speaker,  trade unions in this country are an accepted part of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> fabric and they have a major role to play over the whole of the industrial relations scene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710817_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister’s statement is due to his temperamental failure to distinguish between violence and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710817_reps_27_hor73/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would just say about national service that I have arrived at the conclusion at this stage in my life, when I am safely beyond military age, that in the first instance no-one has the right to dispose of another’s life or freedom, that national service is the ultimate act of violence by the community against a minority of its own members and that that cannot be tolerated in a modern <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But there is the utter loneliness of the 20-year-old which is inflicted upon him by the community at large, by the Liberal Party voters in every electorate, by the Country Party voters in every electorate, by the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party voters in every electorate and by honourable members opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do not increase our influence by taking that kind of action, but at least I feel 1 can say to this House 2 things:  President  Yahya Khan has publicly expressed his intention of transferring power, in an orderly way and in a stable environment, to <span class="highlight">democratic</span> civilian institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bench also pointed to the effect which recognition of selective objection could have on other men who agree with the particular objector at all points, but nevertheless would not seek exemption or assert their selective objection because they held themselves bound by <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes under which the Government has decided that the objections raised to the particular conflict should be overridden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that the statement by the present Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr N. H.

    <p>The Prime Minister’s decision to appoint Assistant Ministers is apparently to broaden the base of the establishment in the parliamentary Liberal Party to stifle his critics so that when the Liberal Party caucus comes to determine whether rank and file members of the Liberal Party should, in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way, elect the Ministry and Cabinet any criticism of the Prime Minister will  be  stifled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710820_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe this demand will never be satisfied, or avoided, whatever economic system is put into operation, unless you cast aside the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes and impose a dictatorship of some form or another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I move this motion because I believe that by continually using its numbers and its powers to gag debates so that statements can go unchallenged, the Government, and the Ministery especially, are deliberately depriving this nation of a proper <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process of government through procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any members who are interested in Parliament and the survival of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system; any members who think that the handing over of the function df Parliament to the media is not in the interests of the people of this country - I believe these matters to be not unimportant - will find the whole thing in a report of a select committee of the House of Commons in 1966 and the ensuing debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray thai your honourable House will give leadership to other citizens by declaring adherence to the general principle of working for a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> legislative, judicial and executive authority, with constitutionally, limited and adequate powers over armaments and disarmament, and over diversion of a proportion of war budgets to a world development fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is extremely important to remember that there are many people who are basically the most <span class="highlight">democratic</span> people in our society, who are more concerned about democracy than almost anybody else, who do more for democracy to continue to exist in our society, but who are being turned off by our sort of society and by the actions of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe that it is a principle that ought to be accepted by any <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government that if the right of conscientious objection is to be recognised there ought to be the opportunity for a person to express his objection to a particular war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As much as the majority parties in this Parliament may criticise it, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party has brought about something that our founding fathers always thought would occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one attends a meeting such as the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference in Malaysia which I recently attended, and if one takes part in a debate for example on a topic such as government and democracy or <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institutions, and listens to the views of people from Africa, Asia and elsewhere as well as of those from the long established democracies of the British Commonwealth, one will come to a viewpoint fairly readily that we have here, however imperfect, a form of democracy which many people in the world would be exceedingly happy to emulate if in fact they could manage to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have our foot somewhere up the middle flight of stairs leading in the direction of knowing that we have a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institution, knowing that we are supposed to represent the people at large and, basically speaking, doing so from what would appear to be a reasonably equitable basis of representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It means: ‘Holding the place of, and acting for, a larger body of persons in the work of governing or legislating; pertaining to, or based upon, a system by which the people is thus represented’; and on this issue I believe we have to speak as representatives in the strict sense of the word because one of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> dilemmas is to get governments to respond. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my view it is nonsensical for the Australian Government to continue with this highly dogmatic and ideological approach Which is also determined by fear of that minority in the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party which dominates the foreign policy of this Government, lt is a luxury that this nation can no longer afford and it is time that Australia recognised that our interests, both diplomatically and economically, are best served by recognising the People’s Republic of China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is true that Government supporters have views on this matter and they can vote as they wish, what a splendid opportunity they have to exercise that tolerant and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process about which the honourable member for Murray  (Mr Lloyd)  spoke when he said that an honourable member was entitled to move such a motion as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I support the motion to suspend the Standing Orders because I cannot think of a greater insult to such a dedicated defender of wine growers and producers as the honourable member for Angas  (Mr Giles)  than being denied the right to express in this Parliament, in a most <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way, where he stands by voting on the motion he moved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ruthlessly and ceaselessly, everything that has happened in Vietnam has been used to incite fear in Australia and to extract <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party preferences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yesterday the Leader of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party  (Senator Gair)  moved the following motion in the Senate: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let me summarise by saying that it is regrettable to think that after 30,000 men have served there, many of whom were killed or injured, it has been left to the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party to bring forward a motion of gratitude which this Government could not amend or alter but which it blindly supports because it never even thought of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I think that because of the great demands that are being made increasingly on the Commonwealth in the whole field of education, some of them justifiable, some of them less so, it will be incumbent upon the universities - I think they have recognised this already - to tighten up to the best of their ability, subject only the difficulties of the human condition and the manner in which we operate our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes through committees and the like, the manner in which they spend their money, both salaries and other forms of expenditure, so that it is expended in the best and least wasteful possible ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, this is more a question for the Minister for Labour and National Service, but in passing I must make the comment that it does seem to me to be a reversal of real <span class="highlight">democratic</span> freedoms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then, when he was hard pressed in a certain election and the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party indicated where preferences would go if there were science blocks, or something like that, there began a steady Commonwealth movement into the field of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest to those Catholics in our community who consider their Catholicism to be the most important part of their makeup and who probably, in a significant proportion of cases, vote for the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party in States such as Victoria, that they talk to some of the Liberal members of Parliament, to the Liberal Ministers, to the Malcolm Frasers, the Robert Menzies, the Malcolm Mackays, the David Fairbairns, the Geoff Gilleses, the Tony Staleys and the Jim Forbeses about parochial schools, or Ireland, or the monarchy, or a truly independent Australia with a new flag and a new anthem and see how much they have in common with those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think the honourable member for Hawker  (Mr Jacobi)  put his finger right on the matter when he said that in this Bill the Government has failed to provide the kind of control that ought to be provided, namely, that there should be 3 commissioners one of whom would represent the teaching service thus giving teachers a professional dignity and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> participation in the service in which they work, one representating other interested sections of the community, and a third representative appointed by the Minister for Education and Science or the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would seem that after their deliberations they have reached the decision that the best way out for all concerned is the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process of holding a referendum to allow the beekeepers themselves to decide whom they want to be on the Australian Honey Board to represent them in the various States in which they reside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Demonstrations are an important part of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Recently in South Australia there was an examination by a royal commis sion, the most thorough that has ever taken place in this country, in relation to demonstrations and the Royal Commissioner,  Mr Justice  Bright of the South Australian Supreme Court, pointed out by quoting  Mr Justice  Kerr in Wright v. McQualter that peaceful demonstration is an important part of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the Victorian Government has accepted that royal commission report and that in both Victoria and South Australia demonstration has become an accepted part of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am convinced that a vast injustice has been done to the people fighting with the forces of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Republic of North Vietnam and what is called the provisional government of South <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What has happened, of course, in recent times )s that he and the Leader of the Opposition have been regularly outdoing one another in delivering blows at the very foundations of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the content and the context of the honourable member for Lalor’s latest call to the streets makes it terribly plain that he simply does not believe in our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At least 1 am a democrat who believes that people count for more than cows, sheep or horses, and that numbers of people is the significant feature in <span class="highlight">democratic</span> decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the elements of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way of life - one of the elements of our parliamentary system - has been the responsibility of members of the Ministry to the Parliament for the subject matter and for the legislation which a Minister brings before this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the Party whose Leader advised youth to break the law and to support violent demonstrations in the streets; one of whose leading members of this Party - a shadow Cabinet Minister - calls on the youth and the people of Australia to take to the streets and defy law and order in an attempt to destroy <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why did this <span class="highlight">democratic</span> body not think of some of these objections itself? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the honourable member for Hughes  (Mr Les Johnson)  mentioned earlier, if you go back as far as <span class="highlight">democratic</span> history goes, you will find that this has been the right of the electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The power of the petition is recognised in the House of Commons and in all <span class="highlight">democratic</span> parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If petitions are becoming ineffective, as I believe they are, then I think it behoves this House to restore to the petition the kind of honour that it is thought to have in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He presented more or less a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This evening during the course of this debate some members on the Government side have said that certain things that have been done and certain practices that have been followed by this Government indicate a breaking down of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles by which we should be operating the Standing Orders of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From my observations since I have had the opportunity to represent the electorate of Bowman, one of the worst features of the breaking down of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles of this House has been the unfair way in which question time has operated against members of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So 13 Liberal Party backbenchers have had the opportunity to exceed the number of questions that have been available to members of the Labor Party - Her Majesty’s Opposition in this Parliament and the Party from which one might expect, in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way, questions calling upon Ministers to account for and justify their actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When will members of the Labor Party learn that in very few instances in <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society has the dead hand of socialism produced any results? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is wrong in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country to think that we can legislate on the great issues in this nation, appropriate millions of dollars and at the same time be intelligent and awake in the early hours of the morning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its duty in terms of its traditional approach to Vietnam has been clearly pointed out to it by the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party and the Friends of Vietnam Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party has taken a position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact that the attitude of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party is quite consistent with the attitude that was held by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statements made by representatives of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party are consistent with the view that what is happening is aggression from the north. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the normal explanation which sometimes is given by the Government’s ally, the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, which is that it was necessary for Australia to have token forces in Vietnam in order to encourage the United States to be there with significant forces, then such a motive is contemptible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will note, therefore, that this Bill pays particular attention to the provisions of the Act which aim at ensuring <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes and affect membership control in organisations registered under the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720426_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendments to the Act can be classified under 6 main headings: Firstly, the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes, including the structure of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, the separation of the conciliation and arbitration functions of the Commission, and appeals and references; secondly a strengthening of the sanctions provisions of the Act, including a review of all penalties provided by the Act; thirdly, the regulation of registered organisations established by the Act to ensure more effective <span class="highlight">democratic</span> control of those organisations, including provisions as to secret ballots in relation to industrial bans and stoppages; fourthly the role of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in dealing with matters of particular significance to the economy of this country; fifthly, the amalgamation of organisations; and sixthly, a wide range of other provisions of the Act which are not without their own special importance to the operation of our system of conciliation and arbitration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720426_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill contains provisions designed to assist in the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> control of registered organisations by their members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720426_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe quite firmly, however, that, before amalgamation takes place, every opportunity should be given to the members of the amalgamating organisations to express their views about that amalgamation in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720426_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society we have some responsibility to look after the needs of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720426_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, is it a fact that the only reason the action has been taken in this matter both in Victoria and Canberra is the heavy subscription of Ansett based funds to the Liberal Party and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would have thought that today the Minister for the Interior  (Mr Hunt)  in dealing with the administration of the Electoral Act would have covered the ramifications of the great <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process envisaged in the Electoral Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This includes, of course, those persons engaged in the administration of the Commonwealth Electoral Office, whose responsibility it is from time to time to conduct the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process of elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government would not want that as it would affect the Austraiian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But we believe that certain legislative reforms are necessary to restore real <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one of the features of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government and one of the great comforts to any member of parliament or any candidate for election to parliament to know that the electoral system of this country is completely impartial and is run with the strictest attention .to the law of the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a rather peculiar form of behaviour for an allegedly <span class="highlight">democratic</span> representative institution such as a government to refuse to tell the people or the representatives of the people the true nature of the structure of freight charges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Corio  (Mr Scholes)  or any other honourable member opposite, would not like to see the disintegration of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party; they would not like to see the extinction of the Australia Party or the Communist Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that it will outlaw the splinter parties that stand over governments and threaten to withdraw their second preferences from a government, as the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party has been doing for some years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, this Government’s philosophy rates very highly the freedom of individuals to decide for themselves, within the broad framework of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society, matters concerning their own wellbeing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last year’s metal trades agreement produced a new stability to the industry until it was interrupted by the Government’s immoral financial support for <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party interference in the metal workers amalgamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I spoke earlier of the extent to which this Government over the years has strengthened the Act to ensure every opportunity for <span class="highlight">democratic</span> control in organisations registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, it dances to the tune of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, a vicious, perverted, unforgiving and unrelenting group of men who were formerly within our Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everything had been done right and it looked as though this proposal was going to go through, until a few weeks ago when there was a bit of a bellow from the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party about whether the Government would allow the amalgamation to take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Furthermore, the matter was brought to the attention of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  and the Leader of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party  (Senator Gair)  on 16th March this year by the National Youth Council of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A glance at the nations provided for a vote at 18 years of age gives a striking example of how far behind Australia lags in providing this <span class="highlight">democratic</span> practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are just a few which one would hardly describe as advanced <span class="highlight">democratic</span> nations, yet this reform is an established fact in those countries, lt is a tragic fact that Australia, which once proudly led the world by giving equal, <span class="highlight">democratic</span> vote to every man and woman, now drags at the heels of some of the much less advanced nations of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Undoubtedly the case for votes for those of 18 years of age is supported by world opinion, by advanced nations and on the grounds of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidently the McMahon Government thinks they would break it and that is why the Prime Minister resists this desirable <span class="highlight">democratic</span> reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister is working on the theory that it is better to deny them a vote and be certain that the majority will not vote against him in preference to giving them <span class="highlight">democratic</span> justice, and a say in the election of their Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government had acted democratically it would long ago have drawn up the uniform legislation with the States that the Minister spoke about covering all the rights that go with adulthood or the age of legal responsibility, such as the right to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This process would have eliminated the additional costs of preparing separate rolls and at the same time it would have established a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right to vote for all 18-year-olds irrespective of State boundaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is the reason, it may be politically expedient but it is certainly democratically contemptible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is enlightened, responsible, just and <span class="highlight">democratic</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such legislation would bring Australia into line with other nations large and small, and would enable us to maintain our place as a leader in the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a great <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is doing this because its political ally, the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party of Australia, has demanded that it do so and this Government, being the sort of Government that it is, with its low level of political fortunes and fearing that it cannot afford to offend this political ally, has obeyed the whip. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is saying: ‘We are immune from your judgment; we will make up the rules of your <span class="highlight">democratic</span> organisation for you. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government claims that it is <span class="highlight">democratic</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just want to say that it is the experience of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> systems all over the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only members of this Party but also members of the’ Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party and many of the Liberal Party back benchers were annoyed about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will lay odds that members of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party would back down so fast they would most likely burn their backsides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people who are known to be active members of the National Civic Council, the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party of Australia and the industrial group movement are known to be well versed in this sort of tactic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Polites  went on to say:  1 believe this demand will never be satisfied or avoided whatever economic system is put into operation, unless you cast aside the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes and impose a dictatorship of some form or another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What  Mr Polites  was advocating was that if any wage justice exists in this country by way of some <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system it should be replaced by a system of absolute dictatorship, a dictatorship controlled by a Liberal Government in collaboration with the Employers Federation, which could stop any further progress by unions towards obtaining a better deal for their members and, in turn, obtaining a fairer share of profits resulting from greater efforts of workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 92 refers to <span class="highlight">democratic</span> control of their own organisation by unionists, assisted where appropriate by secret ballots and supervised where necessary by the industrial court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If any person tells me, with their cerebral processes normal, that this legislation gives <span class="highlight">democratic</span> control of their own organisation by unionists, then I will be prepared to argue the point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The platform clearly sets out the industrial principles that should shape Liberal thinking- high wages, industrial organisation, conciliation and arbitration, profit sharing, the progressive increase of leisure and living standards, <span class="highlight">democratic</span> control of unionists of their own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party played the, tune and the Minister danced to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This did not suit the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party which gets most of its trade union support from the Clerks Union, a union most difficult to organise and one which compulsory unionism strongly favours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said all that, he bent the knee-to and kissed the hand, if not worse, of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party before doing another shuffle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the behest of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party he has made it much harder for unions to amalgamate, in spite of what he had to say about the representatives of 15 small unions having been present at a conference in relation to one issue and his statement that that had occurred on many occasions in regard to his Department itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a sad case of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party tail wagging the Liberal Party dog. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless the Government does this, the amalgamated unions run the risk, after long delays, of being told that this amalgamation, which really sparked off the whole controversy following an attempt by the Government to reach a compromise with the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, will not be allowed to proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I see it, in the long run, that is mainly what <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government is about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether that is done in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rather than a - to use that awful word - bureaucratic way depends to a great extent upon how we as parliamentarians enunciate these problems and respond to the opinions and the expertise that are available outside the Parliament for the solution of these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought he would be concerned to ask me to take the initiative at a much earlier time when South Vietnam was endeavouring to defend itself so that it could have its own form of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government and when from the north it had an invasion of regiments of a regular army seeking to control it by force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those people who have authority in the Labor Party - and the honourable gentleman unfortunately, does not have that authority - always try to avoid this issue, and use terms like ‘<span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialism* or some other term in order to put off the issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If somebody would come with me I would start a campaign in Toowoomba to let the people of his electorate know what he is doing to the parliamentary institution, which belongs to them and which he is reducing to a complete and absolute failure as a representative legislative <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But what a wonderfully <span class="highlight">democratic</span> Australian Labor Party this is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was no division between the Liberal Party, the Australian Country Party, the Australian Labor Party and the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party on this matter in that Senate Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my way of thinking, that is a very important matter in the approach to a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>this Government’s philosophy rates very highly the freedom of individuals to decide for themselves, within the broad framework of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society, matters concerning their own well-being. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a philosophy quite different from that of the Government -  rates very highly the freedom of individuals to decide for themselves within the broad framework of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society, matters concerning their own well being. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that the honourable member for Isaacs is perfectly entitled in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> Parliament to move an amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is our desire to follow the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way of life I believe it is essential that Western democracies be united, and I include in that category Great Britain, the United States of America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and those European and Asian countries which want democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we should be doing, surely, is recognising that there are <span class="highlight">democratic</span> forces at work in Indonesia, and that they have been catered for by the present Indonesian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should also recognise, acknowledge and approve publicly that, after ail, there has been an election in Indonesia, that that election was conducted with candidates, that there were political parties involved, that there was a fairly hot contest in that election and that it was run along fairly <span class="highlight">democratic</span> lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One also should say publicly that we recognise that the Indonesian Government has had the courage, in view of its recent history, to hold the election along generally <span class="highlight">democratic</span> lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the credit of that Government it does not pretend that the election was completely <span class="highlight">democratic</span>, using the definition of ‘<span class="highlight">democratic</span>’ that we would use in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What it has said is that now it has achieved a measure of stability, now that it has come through an election along generally <span class="highlight">democratic</span> lines, it will continue at each subsequent election along those lines until there is a completely civilianised and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second important lesson is that we must encourage governments in South East Asia to introduce more <span class="highlight">democratic</span> reforms and to introduce them more quickly than has been done in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with him that we should not downgrade the efforts being made in countries such as Indonesia in their endeavours to attain what we would regard as a truly <span class="highlight">democratic</span> state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are perhaps 14 or 15 <span class="highlight">democratic</span> countries, even judged by the present Victorian or Queensland standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Republic of Vietnam - North Vietnam to all of us - is one of the world’s most isolated countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can we make this change more acceptable to a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> Parliament such as this? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Knowing the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process perhaps more clearly than I did in the past, I think we ought to consider bringing about changes more slowly but surely inevitably in regard to existing industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is there any way that the Government can assist the honourable member for Shortland to exercise his <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right to make a statement in this House? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Prime Minister not accept the proposition that if political satire can be produced and shown by the British Broadcasting Corporation with great success, the Australian Broadcasting Commission should be afforded the same fundamental freedom in our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind him that 3 Liberal senators, the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party senators and the Independents in another place opposed the principles of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party members were roused from their reverie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a most important Bill affecting the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government intend to deny the people the reforms necessary to bring the Commonwealth Electoral Act into line with modern-day thinking in all <span class="highlight">democratic</span> countries? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that this delay is another step in the Country Party’s well-known policy of denying all the principles applying to <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The delay must be taken as an indication that it is intended, if at all possible, to gerrymander the Australian electorates to the advantage of the minority group - the Australian Country Party - and to prevent electoral reform and its effect on the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> functions in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For those reasons, for the reasons stated by the Minister in his second reading speech which was made a long time ago, in March 1971, and also because the Labor Party wishes to take an opportunity to move amendments to this Bill in line with Labor Party policy to reform the Commonwealth Electoral Act to make our franchise more <span class="highlight">democratic</span>, to extend the franchise to 18-year-olds and to ensure that the electoral system is run as honestly and efficiently as it may be run, I support the motion moved by the honourable member for Grayndler for the suspension of Standing Orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is clear that the Government, under pressure from the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, was trying to make amalgamation more difficult. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This did not stop the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, because most of its support in the industrial movement comes from the Federated Clerks Union, which would be a difficult union to organise without compulsory unionsim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We said that it was bad when it was proposed in this place and it has not been improved by the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, whose masters in the community insisted that certain amendments be carried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My disquiet is not in any way alleviated by the fact that, when this amendment was moved by the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party in the Senate, no explanation was given by the Minister in charge of the Bill in that chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>7, to which I think the honourable member for Kingston  (Dr Gun)  specifically referred, this amendment is an amalgam of the amendments brought into the Senate not only by the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party but also by the Opposition and accepted by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The system of government which has enabled Brisbane to be changed from a large country town, not befitting the capital of the State, to a city which on today’s standards provides all the essentials of good living is surely one which in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> sense most honourable members, I am sure, would agree should be left as it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Country Party, supported by its partner in crime, the Liberal Party - which polled 22 per cent of the vote for a total of 21 seats; nearly as many seats as its percentage of the total vote - is able to inflict its wishes on the democratically elected city administration i;i the Greater Brisbane area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The view of the honourable member for Lalor of socialism envisages worker control - not participation - and he has said that the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process leading to this begins in the streets, on the farms and in the factories’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But when the preferences of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party and all the other splinter parties were distributed we lost 13 of those 72 seats and finished with 59 members to 66 in this present Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On this side of the Parliament we have a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> party system of election to the front bench and we have <span class="highlight">democratic</span> decisions by all of the elected representatives on policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Labor Party has a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> and open method of deciding policy that is not recognised by the power drunk leaders on the other side of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nationalisation in these circumstances would be a very <span class="highlight">democratic</span> procedure because it would be decentralising control by taking control out of the hands of the multi-national corporations and putting it on a national basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have spoken to private members of the Liberal Party, the Country Party, my own Party and the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, and not one has disagreed with my contention that the distinction between the qualifications necessary for a Minister and the qualifications for private members and senators is discriminatory to the point of being ludicrous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first concerns the difficulties of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> governments in dealing with large scale lawlessness organised by tightly knit subversive minorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has come about because even a band of archangels and geniuses could not properly operate a supposedly <span class="highlight">democratic</span> organisation if it is not subject to the checks and balances on which any effective <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system must depend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>there is not a natural <span class="highlight">democratic</span> check, because most people very sensibly do not want to spend their spare time on such chores. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me make it clear that what is happening within the unions is an affront to all <span class="highlight">democratic</span> parties, including the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, if elected to government, the Australian Labor Party would find the issue very divisive on account of its anti-<span class="highlight">democratic</span> lunatic left which, mercifully, is only a small minority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that the people behind the strikes are out to destroy or subvert the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> majority within the ALP as much as they are out to confront arbitration and the Government, such is the influence on the Australian Labor Party of the lunatic Left - the Hartleys, the Browns, the Crawfords - ‘that the Labor Party is forced to side with them in public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He seemed to be anxious to criticise the fact that on this side of the Parliament we pursue a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process, I take it that he contends that it is undesirable that on this side of the Parliament we follow the traditional practice of deciding our Party’s policy at the weekly Party meetings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whether it is  Sir Frank  Packer or the Prime Minister whose dictums the honourable member is prepared to accept I do not know, but honourable members on this side of the Parliament uphold the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complementing the stimulation will be the improved living conditions of all Australians resulting from a stronger economy in which poverty will be largely reduced, the opportunities for employment markedly increased and the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right of every Australian to share in Australia’s growth escalated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are too lazy and they work too hard; they are police pimps and they run the Mafia; they are all Catholic <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party supporters and atheists trying to bring in the continental Sunday; they are illiterate and they win all the scholarships; they are mean and hoard all their money and at the same time they are mad gamblers; they lock up their wives and daughters and they make them walk the streets; and of course they bludge on our social services, cheat our workers compensation companies and worst of all they win nearly all the lotteries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 also like the proposition that is being put forward in the Senate at the moment by the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party senators, for an additional curb by way of legislation to prevent manufacturers from increasing prices - a price limiting Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be true to say that successive Liberal Party, Country Party and <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party coalition governments have used local government as a repository for tasks for which the Federal Government wishes to have no responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the United States there are people such as Jane Fonda and even the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> presidential candidate McGovern, both of whom are saying to Hanoi and to the North Vietnamese: ‘Hang on long enough and it will be all right because we will undermine the very things that are happening’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sometimes the public are disadvantaged as well because there should be proper notice and sufficient time to enable the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process to run its full race and to go the full course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The position in the Senate at the moment is that there are 26 members from the Government parties, 26 from the Australian Labor Party, 5 from the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party and 3 independents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This situation has presented no problem to this stage because when it came to the crunch the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party could always be relied upon to support the Government parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This situation is unfair in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institution and it is unfair to the people generally, because we on this side are entitled to the facilities necessary in order to carry on the tasks of government and to put our case to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I can assure honourable members that there will be changes for the good, and a vibrant new Labor government, whenever the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  likes to face the people, will not only stimulate interest in this Parliament but also give the people a really <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institution in which they will receive the results that they pray for and can get only under a Labor government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I look down the long history of it all - whether it be the times of Charles I or Eureka, whether it be the Nuremberg decree itself - the right of government by decree to issue an ultimatum in the dead of night and to enforce it in that clandestine way has been one of the hallmarks of absolutism and the total destruction of common sense, <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I take the view that, under the Labor administration in South Australia, that State is degenerating into a banana republic, where the institutions that we expect to be the watchdogs of our hard-won <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes are under attack and are gradually being taken over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am satisfied that the series of governments we have had under  Sir Robert  Menzies,  Mr Gorton  and  Mr McMahon  - I leave out one Prime Minister - have favoured making some aspects of political freedom into crimes and, on the contrary, have proved sympathetic to certain criminal conduct provided that those who carry it out are anticommunist and are supported or believed they will be supported by <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party type and National Civic Council type leaders and supporters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Foremost among them, I think, is the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process which has taken place about this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the course of the 1970 State elections in South Australia full page newspaper advertisements were placed by the Liberal Party’s great friend and political ally, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-56-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is what I discovered: The Liberal and Country League advertisements had been prepared and placed by the Party’s traditional advertising agency, Martin Kinnear Clemenger Pty Ltd, in which company the largest shareholder is John Clemenger Pty Ltd which we all know is the agency used by the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-56-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, there can be no doubt where the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party stands in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How can any of us in this place make comments about Vietnam and other South East Asian countries being undemocratic because their polling systems are open to outside direction when we in this country have an electoral system which is open to exactly the same thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If Australia pretends to stand up as an example of a true <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country with an honest electoral system then we owe it to ourselves to do something about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further on, when dealing with poker machines which, I think, are the most vicious kind of instrument ever perpetrated in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society but which, nevertheless, are the backbone of marginal revenue in the State of New South Wales, the Commission said - and this seems to me to be a rather curious kind of suggestion: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The categories of exclusion are not disputed because those documents are similarly available to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate  (Senator Murphy),  the Leader of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party  (Senator Gair)  and the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, and they have been available for some 4 weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The pace of change and mobility in mass cities and mass organisations in the mass cities have exacerbated the problems of the home, work, the community and government in contemporary society, lt is not without point that our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> forms of organisation grew in quite different soil to that which exists today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As those who have spoken have said, I believe that the Parliament must serve a function in our democracy and unless the Parliament meets this requirement the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system will cease to operate effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Government when in Opposition eneavoured to extend the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right of the franchise to the youth of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It preferred to deny this well recognised <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right to an important section of the Australian community - the youth of this country - although the franchise for those 18 years and above is well recognised throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the House who were honoured to be members of the last Parliament know full well that the opportunity was taken by the people of Australia on the occasion of the last election to cast out the Liberal-Country Party coalition and to elect the Labor Party into office after 23 years of Liberal-Country Party rule despite the gutter tactics that were used and despite the lies of the previous government and particularly those of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion I should like to say that there is no doubt that the people of Australia on this occasion have made a decision which, on previous occasions, they have endeavoured to make but have failed to make because of the distribution of preferences from minority groups, particularly the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the latter part of his speech he referred to the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)  certainly has one record - an unenviable one - to his credit, namely, that alone he has notched up the discovery of more Communists in Australia than the sum of all security agencies in the whole of the Western world, including such <span class="highlight">democratic</span> republics, which he upholds, as South Africa and Rhodesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally, we will not stand by passively and watch the Prime Minister and the Government eroding our defence capacity, our relations with trusted and valued allies, our international reputation and our fundamental <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are also of the view that the Singapore Government is anti-<span class="highlight">democratic</span> and that Australian military association with Singapore is incompatable with Labor principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the people of Australia recognise that it is a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any action which may be taken as an eventual and probably far removed outcome of the information gathered by the 121st Signals Squadron can only be the result of the normal <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes of government in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will not be such a great loss of time because this is a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if the honourable gentleman wants me to spell out what T said publicly a few days ago then  I  will be glad to inform him that as the Australian Labor Party is democratically based - unlike the Opposition parties - every member of the Party has a right to determine policy which will be submitted to the Parliamentary Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To conclude the answer: The honourable member is well aware of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes that take place and I repeat what 1 have said, that the Government will make the decisions but when policy decisions are made by the Party then naturally they will be given due consideration by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 deem it a signal honour to be standing in this national Parliament, having arrived here through the medium of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way of voting, and to express the loyalty of the people of McMillan to the Queen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that there are elements within our midst desirous of deleting any reference to our ancestral mother country; they would sever the traditional ties of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government if given the opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason for my saying that is abundantly clear to those of us who have great credence in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system of parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If people are to determine their own destinies, which is what democracy is all about, then <span class="highlight">democratic</span> practice must coincide with economic reality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So much for the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> theory of the socialist party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we, for instance, a truly <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society except perhaps by a fine balance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way of life has allowed us to develop an independence of thought, speech and action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system, disagreement and discussion are both inevitable and desirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But for more than any of these specific reasons, it must be supported as a step towards a more <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society, a more equal society and a more just society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps it could serve as an example and a precedent for other defence and foreign affairs subjects because this is an area where in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country, it is certainly in the interests of the country if the contending political parties can arrive at bipartisan policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only time that compulsory unionism was included in the Party’s platform was during the period when the element within the Labor Party which finally broke away to form what is now called the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party had control of policy making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the speech of the honourable member for Indi demonstrated a total incapacity to understand what the social objectives of a modern <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society were. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would first of all like to thank the electors of Evans for giving me and the Australian Labor Party a mandate to implement a policy to make Australia a truly great and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our hands rests the future success or failure of our course of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have, to a certain extent, ignored the misrepresentations instead of reacting positively and explaning to the people what a modern <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialist thinks, and how our policies fit in wilh that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition makes much of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> structure of the Labor Party and this has been particularly so in the last few days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, I say - because that speaks for itself - that such a concept is completely undemocratic because the program emerges from a body - in this case the Labor Party - which represents perhaps half or even less than half of the electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can it be said that it is <span class="highlight">democratic</span> that a program that proceeds from half the people of Australia has the sanction of the whole of the people of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, Parliament is the only <span class="highlight">democratic</span> body in this nation, not the Conference of the Labor Party or any conference of the Liberal Party or any other conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only <span class="highlight">democratic</span> body in this country that stands for the whole of the people of Australia is this Parliament because it represents not half but all of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, because it is the only body whose members are elected and can have their mandates withdrawn by all the people, so it is the Parliament which is the only <span class="highlight">democratic</span> body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I listened to honourable members opposite telling us that the Labor Party is <span class="highlight">democratic</span> and therefore it has a mandate from the people of Australia, this is manifest nonsense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the only <span class="highlight">democratic</span> body in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us have no more nonsense along the lines that because the Labor Party is said to be <span class="highlight">democratic</span> therefore it has a mandate from the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether it is <span class="highlight">democratic</span> in its own organisation 1 do not know and cannot accept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are now making a contribution to the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process, and that is as it should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Bennelong claimed that he was denied the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right to speak in the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the House referred to our lack of social justice in not lowering the voting age, yet in his second reading speech, by quoting the Prime Minister’s words, he showed clearly that it was Australia under Liberal-Country Party governments which enabled young people to attain the all-round maturity and competence which now makes them eligible, arid rightly so, to participate more, fully in the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But for years we have seen the spectacle of leading members of this Parliament - those who now sit on the Government benches - advocating rule by demonstration, rule by violent protest and in fact the circumvention of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes by which a government is elected and given a mandate to carry out its policies and by which the people can change that government if its actions no longer appeal to the majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That system is only undemocratic when the other group, the group now represented by the Opposition, is in power’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor will they fail to realise that it is only the Government which has changed, not the whole <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will surely be one of history’s ironies that a government heavily influenced by the left wing forces should introduce a Bill which gave us ultimate proof of our young people’s faith in the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system and which indicated its acknowledgment that a LiberalCountry Party Government created the conditions necessary to give this responsibility to the young people throughout the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He said that youth was forced to move away from the normal <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process and toward direct action when they did not have the vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems, from an analysis of these polls, to be well and truly rooted in the conservatism of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party and the Liberal and Country parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact is that this matter has been unfortunately interpreted in the past as politics at its lowest level; not politics as it should be and not politics in the sense that it is a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> exercise of will or power to implement changes that are to the advantage of the great majority of members of our community, bringing into play a clash of ideas, a clash of ideologies and a clash of thoughts so that all people will benefit as they will by the passage of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The list contains names of countries not only that are insignificant in terms of major influence in our sphere of the world but also that lay claim to having a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> form of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a statement two or three months before that from the Leader of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party to this effect: Radical teachers were now being placed in positions where they could brainwash impressionable children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the education system evolved by the backward Liberal Party, the reactionary Country Party and the nonentity called the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, people today are far more advanced in their thinking than the previous Government ever was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand his description of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party as a nonentity, I am sure, will go down fairly well across Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government should do this sort of thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Free elections are basic to a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, equality of political rights is inherent in a truly <span class="highlight">democratic</span> State and these rights must be indisputably safeguarded by the legislature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all its forms, the device is thoroughly subversive of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Electoral Act - the mirror of a nation’s <span class="highlight">democratic</span> image before the world - is expected to proclaim equality and not privilege. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will sup port this policy - undemocratic and biased as it is - for on it depends their survival individually and as a party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have fought tooth and nail against any reforms designed to maintain <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections in Australian Parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gives to those who sit in this Parliament the opportunity to say whether they believe in these <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles and the equal rights of all electors, or whether they stand for manipulation of the Electoral Act to retain governments of their political colour irrespective of the vote of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Act, if members of the Country Party who are interjejcting will be silent for the fleeting remainder of my speech, is a challenge to those who sit opposite to stand up and be counted on the fundamental <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle of one vote one value and majority rule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is time that honourable gentlemen, particularly in the Opposition parties, realise that the public does not accept that the methods of voting which have applied at various stages in Australia until now are the acme of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> perfection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the committee consist of eight Members of the House of Representatives nominated by the Prime Minister, four Members of the House of Representatives nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, two Members of the House of Representatives nominated by the Leader of the Australian Country Party in the House of (Representatives, four Senators nominated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, two Senators nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, one  Senator nominated  by the Leader of the Australian Country Party in the Senate and one  Senator nominated  by the Leader of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must never accept the proposition that we must get used to political terrorism, involving bombings, murder, intimidation and that <span class="highlight">democratic</span> governments are powerless to suppress such activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should not abandon our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles of free speech, belief and association but I would hope that migrants are left with no misunderstanding of the disfavour with which the Government would view  any activities which might reasonably give rise to objections by the present governments of their countries of origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the institution of Parliament that preserves our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only the most naive person could believe that the motivation of the Labor Party is that of objectivity or commitment to the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It then becomes an issue of degree as to what lesser numbers for a noncity seat can be accepted without subverting the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its self-righteous claims of concern for <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles are so much eyewash. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Bill has very little to do with the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right of every Australian to be equally represented in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will be subject in this debate to a welter of words about the so-called <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle of one vote one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The law is to be changed so that the Labor Party can perpetuate itself in office at the cost of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right of every elector to enjoy equality of representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">democratic</span> procedures the Government, now the Australian Labor Party, has contested many elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principle is more <span class="highlight">democratic</span> and more sound. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once one breaks with the principle that in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society every man’s vote should be of equal value one runs into all kinds of anomalies and contradictions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I accept the proposition and 1 believe that if we tell the people of Australia, as we are doing, about it they will accept this proposition that one man, one vote, one value is the only principle that any <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society possibly can accommodate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Many people have voted for the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party or for the Australia Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People in any other country would consider that we had taken leave of our senses, lost our sense of perspective and lost all sense of reality if in our circumstances we asserted that to pay some limited regard to these factors was in some way perpetrating an intolerable outrage on the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights of the vast majority of the population who live cheek by jowl in a handful of metropolitan cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>elect Government are to be given their <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights, it is of immense importance that the electoral system is a fair one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My attitude as an elected representative is that the electoral rights of people of Australia are paramount and these must receive proper consideration if we are to suggest that the electoral system of this nation is a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears that they oppose the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> belief that enrolments for divisions should be as nearly as possible equal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right to electoral equality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The crux of the Bill is concerned with a matter which is at the heart of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> parliamentary process, namely, that as far as possible the value of a man’s vote should be the same wherever he lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In an attempt to maintain the Liberal-Country Party alliance they have abandoned the basic <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle which is incorporated in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that it would be far more <span class="highlight">democratic</span> if representation were on the basis of number of people in an electorate rather than numbers of voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We contend also that matters such as disabilities arising out of remoteness or distance, density or sparsity of population and the area of a division are totally out of place in any parliamentary system which purports to reflect <span class="highlight">democratic</span> pr, nc, p es. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Constitutional Review Committee in its recommendations was upholding a principle which is beyond dispute in any <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system - the principle of equality of representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever the matter of electoral redistribution has been under consideration, the Labor Party, as the Opposition, has moved appropriate amendments which attempted to give effect to the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> findings of the Constitutional Review Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been consistent adherence to a principle which we on the Government side hold to be inviolate in the total <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process - that is, one vote one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equality of political rights is inherent in any truly <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system and these rights must be safeguarded by the legislature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is whether to support the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle that is embodied in the Bill - one vote one value - or whether to continue to support the manipulations that exist in the present Electoral Act whereby one group in the community continues to be over-represented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Free elections are basic to a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been the case not only in this country but also in every country that aims to live under a system people like to call <span class="highlight">democratic</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst our own situation has been to a certain extent free from the violence of many other countries in their aspirations to seek fair and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> representation for their people, our own past shows that the political struggles to establish our own form of democracy have been a continuing political confrontation with the Establishment and the forces of privilege, and unfortunately this political fight for fair and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> representation has not been finally won. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In every case they can frustrate the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> wishes of the people as reflected in the franchise that exists in the State lower Houses, despite the fact that there are inequalities in these themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in every one of the States we find that the power of the upper House is far beyond what it should be in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the upper House in South Australia, that is the Legislative Council, we have a clear example of the undemocratic procedure of upper Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further hurdle to <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government is the fact that the number of electors in the 5 districts varies from 106,000 in one district, that is Central District No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the House firmly believe that one man’s vote is as good as anothers, and we will continue to press for reforms in the electoral system of our society so that we can say that our society is <span class="highlight">democratic</span> in every sense ot the word. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, we gained a great deal from exploring with our colleagues from all over the Commonwealth the different ways and means of improving the efficiency of our parlia mentary institutions and the different paths of our common goal - <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government in the best interests of our peoples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation would make it impossible for a country member to service adequately his electorate and it would deny country electors the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights to which they are entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He wants to deny to the electors who live in these areas their <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Minister has proposed is not <span class="highlight">democratic</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And it was a successful frustration of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process, for in the elections of 1950 the Liberal and Country Party team won a majority of the votes, actually 49.7 per cent, but gained only 31 of tha 75 seats, whereas Labor polled but 46.5 per cent of the votes yet managed to get 42 of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government now and they are speaking in committee, which was rarely, if ever, the case in the last Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Victoria - one cannot say that that is a really <span class="highlight">democratic</span> State - the margin is down to 10 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, those who support a margin of 20 per cent and the removal of these barriers, which count trees, acres, horses and cows instead oi people, subscribe to a system of political gerrymandering that has no place in any <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the long run real <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government, real equality of representation or real equality in the value of votes is achieved only by ensuring that all members of this Parliament have an equal opportunity to represent the people in their electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system allowed it to be voted into office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The essential part of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system is that it does allow any Party, large or small, any organisation or any individual to run for parliamentary office and have some confidence in the result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is most decidedly a challenge to those who sit in this place to stand up and be counted on whether Australia is to have continued <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rule and opportunity or whether the will of any one Party is to dominate our legislature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Factors that allow a party which gains 8 per cent of the votes to enjoy 16 per cent of the parliamentary representation have no place in an Electoral Act that should enshrine the basic <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle of one vote one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To persevere with an electoral distribution which denies the voters the right of determining which people or parties represent them in Parliament is a denial of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee also considered that the device of creating substantial disparities in the number of enrolled voters and so securing for a political party greater representation than it should have is, to quote the words of the Committee, ‘in all its forms thoroughly subversive of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In considering this Bill and more particularly clause 3 we have to ask ourselves what are the essential features of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> and equitable electoral system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, I would not imagine that the Minister, despite his wide circle of friends, would include the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party amongst his and the Australian Labor Party’s most fervent supporters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there is no question that the present system is not consistent with <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious from this Bill and the amendments to it that the Government is not happy to let our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way of life proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those people who would deny that concept are people who would deny the very basic tenet of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not here to preside over the dilution of citizen rights in this community, and those people who say that as a matter of some almost divine right they should have more say than others are people who do not and cannot claim to have any sympathy with the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The weight of the argument was ultimately that there must be equality in the value of voting, otherwise the whole concept of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society crashed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are discussing what is the most <span class="highlight">democratic</span> and most equitable way of ensuring that we have government by the people and that every citizen has an equal say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the performance in this House today does not display any great civil liberties in respect of the rights of members of Parliament in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institution where there should be freedom of expression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the ultimate, the greatest problem that a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> community must face is the problem of equity in the distribution of the total resources that the economy is capable of generating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that some movement towards these aims has been accomplished in Queensland, obviously because of the influence of the Premier of that State, the honourable Joh Bjelke-Petersen and his Country Party colleagues, and in the Federal sphere due to the efforts of the Country Party and the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party which are aware, as they have always been, of the grave injustices caused by these savage duties which owe their existence to tradition and the vagaries of Federal-State relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had recently the most unprecedented action that has even been taken in Australian <span class="highlight">democratic</span> history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was quite unprecedented and undemocratic; it was an action which we would hope would never again occur in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who would not want to forget the wrangles going on between the Country Party, the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party and the Liberal Party? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why does not the honourable member stand up and have a go at those who destroy every <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, it was the bitterness that arose from this that, on  Dr Evatt’s  own statement of 1955, was one of the prime causes for the attitude he adopted which led to the formation of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party’s objective now is <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was changed a bit because it was thought that this was somewhat unpopular so the Labor Party now calls it <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialisation’ - whatever that might mean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not see what <span class="highlight">democratic</span> means in this context - the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are: The removal of existing barriers to trade union amalgamation; the protection of organisations and their members from civil actions for tort in connection with industrial disputes; the removal of the Commission’s authority to ban strikes and the removal of all penal sanctions upon strikers; procedures to ensure that certain types of agreement are acceptable to members of organisations affected by them; provision for <span class="highlight">democratic</span> control of unions and the fullest participation by union members in the affairs of their organisations; provision to enable action to be taken for the recovery of wages at law within a period of 6 years instead of the 12 months’ limitation that now applies; the removal of the various defects which have been shown to exist in the 1972 legislation; elimination of the power to award costs in proceedings before the courts, the Registrar or the Commission; and provision to overcome some of the problems created by the Moore v.

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party used every device at its disposal to thwart the amalgamation of the metal trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government will encourage the elimination of tendencies that prejudice <span class="highlight">democratic</span> control of trade unions by assisting rank and file members to bring their grievances over alleged defects in rules and in abuse of rules, to the Commonwealth Industrial Court for examination and, where called for, correction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have explained that we will remove those provisions which discourage amalgamation of unions; that we will protect organisations and their members from civil actions for tort in connection with industrial disputes; that we will remove completely from the Act the power to prohibit strikes or enforce penal sanctions against strikes and that we will build the framework for more <span class="highlight">democratic</span> control of unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This measure is totally inconsistent with the workings of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institution - with the effective operation of this Parliament - and the Opposition believes it should be resisted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In regard to Wednesday mornings, I think it is an important factor that 90 Bills are being introduced in this session of Parliament and, in fairness to the public and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights, all of these require close attention and study clause by clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They should take a keen interest in the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process and should realise who are responsible for the delay in the passage of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The inherent difficulties which are experienced by all governments in liberal <span class="highlight">democratic</span> societies in regulating the economic behaviour of these private organisations - and particularly the less disciplined elements within them - must command particular attention: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we believe it is imperative that there be <span class="highlight">democratic</span> participation in the amalgamation process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>History clearly demonstrates the need to have measures in the legislation to protect the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights of union members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We believe that this is entirely contrary to the Minister’s public posture that unions should be democratically controlled and that rank and file members should be provided with the maximum opportunity to express their views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister justified this proposal in terms of the preservation of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> participation in the affairs of unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is making a farce of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> procedure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is nonsense in this <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society, this free economy, to suggest that workers who participate in a stoppage of work because little Mary Jones has been sacked out of turn are engaging in a conspiracy, and that a jam company for which she worked should be able to sue the workers individually and collectively through their union for damages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It talked about open government, <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government, but when what has been always recognised in this Parliament as one of the most important pieces of legislation is brought before, this House in the first Parliament under this Government, the gag is applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also appreciate that any major change involving the amalgamation of unions should take place on a more <span class="highlight">democratic</span> basis than is proposed under the Bill that we are considering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He came into the trade union movement as the State Secretary of the Federal Clerks Union of Australia when he was only 22 years of age, and he is regarded by all sections of the trade union movement - whether they are communists, supporters of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, Labor Party people, right, left or centre - as the most competent and one of the most capable men in the business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But outside a totalitarian dictatorship no government can suppress concerted stoppages of work and no <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government should want to stop concerted stoppages of work by people who can no longer bear the burden of wage injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system the people have a number of basic and inalienable rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member will be surprised or, perhaps, pleased to learn that none of the trade union officials who normally support the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party point of view has sent me a telegram but there has been a fairly broad spectrum of points of view represented in the telegrams that I have received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The basis of law in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society is that its provisions must apply equally to all members of that society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If that is the best we can offer, I say that we are bankrupt of true humanitarian values that should characterise any modern <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And because it is the basic right in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society, all other rights and the exercise of our civil liberties rest on that fundamental proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is contrary to the human rights and humane values which must be the fundamental concerns of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we are to have a systematic and comprehensive planning scheme such as operates in Canberra it is important that we make sure that <span class="highlight">democratic</span> checks and controls are inserted into the system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now that an Australian delegation has gone to Communist China perhaps we could ask the members of that delegation to look at what happened in Tibet where religious persecution was accompanied by wholesale genocide, where the Dalai Lama, the religious leader of the country, is in exile and where that country is still being closed by its Chinese overlords to any visit by observers from <span class="highlight">democratic</span> nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is an important <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle that seems to be supported only by us on this side of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that the first plank in the Labor Party’s policy is the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange, and there is no question that the Pipeline Authority Bill is a vehicle for the socialisation program of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A method of debasing the influence of this <span class="highlight">democratic</span> Parliament is the use of the Press conferences, which would circumvent much of the decision making and discussion on public issues that affect this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was wondering why they jump to their feet during the adjournment debate and I suddenly recalled, of course, that soon we will hear of the marriage - whether it is shotgun or unhappy, I do not know - of the Australian Country Party and the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The relevance of that is simply this: The prime objective of the Government, which my honourable friend leads and of which the Minister for Transport  (Mr Charles Jones)  is a distinguished member, is <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear then to be more <span class="highlight">democratic</span> to have an even number elected each time for each Territory thus following the pattern of the major parties providing that each would have a representative in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only solid result to emerge from that election in Victoria is that the Country Party and the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Parity are a dying race. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 am one of those who believe that none of those things have a place in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The argument is usually put as one whereby the system of local government, which is designed to administer small areas with direct and visible representation by councils, is one which is most amenable te our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> tradition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the potential ability of local government to provide for the immediate access of directly elected representatives to a community which gives it this <span class="highlight">democratic</span> quality once described by Harold Laski as *the genius of place’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If Jock Nelson bad continued as a member of this Parliament the honourable member for Mackellar knows very well that the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> sentiments of the Government of 1968 would not have conferred voting rights upon him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think in this respect the ancestor of the honourable member for Mackellar, with his House of baronets proposal, was much more <span class="highlight">democratic</span> than the honourable member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We certainly agree with what the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  said concerning the need for this Parliament to operate in an effective and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> fashion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unfortunate that the Leader of the House, having completed an extensive overseas trip to examine the operation of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institutions of government, is not prepared to give this House some evidence of his newly acquired enlightenment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So, with the centralist policies denying State parliaments their right we will find that the whole function of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> parliamentary system in Australia will be further foreshortened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In any <span class="highlight">democratic</span> situation - at any rate, in areas which founded their system of Government on the British system - there is another factor to be considered, that is, what we on this side of the House are for the time being, namely,  Her  Majesty’s Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it does not do that, the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process, to which I believe this country over many years owes a great deal, can be brought into disrepute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we want is a certain amount of give and take to make sure that the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process is allowed a fair crack of the whip. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the committee consist of three Members of the House of Representatives nominated by the Prime Minister, one Member of the House of Representatives nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, one Member of tha House of Representatives nominated by the Leader of the Australian Country Party in the House of Representatives, two Senators nominated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, one  Senator nominated  by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and one  Senator nominated  by the Leader of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is one of the most significant representative institutions in the world because of the very structure of our system which is basically <span class="highlight">democratic</span> and representative of all the citizens and yet which stands in a community which is generally concerned with Presidents, royalties and everybody else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia is becoming a nation riddled by political gerrymanders in certain States and the worst of these are in New South Wales and Queensland where there is blatant unashamed gerrymandering of electoral boundaries in order to not ensure <span class="highlight">democratic</span> control but the continuation of Liberal Party-Country Party minority government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My view is that those who truly believe in <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government will consider this Bill on the ground of principle, not in a narrow and cynical way concerned only with grabbing political power or with the obsession to maintain disproportionate representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have written to  Mr Dickie  to try to clarify these questions of the use of English and to make clear to him that the system is principally based upon the assumption that in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society people are entitled to deal directly with the government responsible for the facilities which it supplies to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party in 1972) had decided 23 of the 38 Liberal seats in the House of Representatives including half of the ‘Shadow Cabinet’ (Snedden, Lynch, Fraser, Chipp, Bowen and Killen). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Just before the 1972 election, in my electorate of Lilley a vicious campaign was waged by the National Civic Council, the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, the Liberals and pseudoLiberals - cum-DLP-supporters who stooped to every undesirable tactic to instil fear into the minds of people about the future education of their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system there is no other way whereby industries can determine where the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only way in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system by which the producer can know what is needed in the economy is for him to receive the market signals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sorry that the system works like this but I do not think that anybody in this House would deny that in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system that is the only way in which producers of goods will receive the signals to increase or decrease production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Parliament is the only <span class="highlight">democratic</span> body in the industrially developed world which does not have power to regulate prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The establishment of the Social Welfare Commission is a further demonstration of the Government’s commitment to introduce <span class="highlight">democratic</span> participation into national government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great difficulty the Government faces is that it cannot guarantee to implement its policy because the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party in another place has indicated that it will not have a bar of the Bill at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The then honourable member for Lilley certainly must have worked very quietly towards it because we never heard very much from that gentleman except words of praise for his friends in the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is utterly wrong in this <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system to have a situation in which a Minister can personally appoint members to an inspectorate of this kind or appoint members to any police force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that the Minister would recognise the fundamental importance and the fundamental significance of this amendment to the basic <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system which we seek to preserve and which I hope he would seek to preserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Doubtless the Minister would argue that this is an extension of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights of the ordinary unionist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Sure it sounds fine and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> to return to seek rank and file support or agreement for a negotiation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many unions and unionists who, having democratically elected their officials, are prepared to support them through to a conclusion on any difficult negotiation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this is a fundamental <span class="highlight">democratic</span> concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that it is a fundamental <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialist concept that people deal directly with the governments to whom they look for assistance or whose laws rule them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not arguing for any abstract <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle; I am saying that this sort of development is highly desirable because tensions and misunderstandings in the environment of aged persons homes will inevitably arise otherwise to the discomfort and the unhappiness of the residents and also to the discomfort and concern of management committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>ls this in line with the principles of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> practice in modern society? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party, in accordance with its <span class="highlight">democratic</span> practices, has endeavoured to remedy this situation by giving representation in both Houses to the Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legislation to that effect has been introduced, and I hope that common sense and the desire to give in both Houses <span class="highlight">democratic</span> representation to the Territories will receive the support of honourable members opposite when the legislation is presented again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has done a very mangy deal with the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party and it is terrified of the unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He also did not know Caucus’s mind, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party’s mind or  Mr Hawke’s  mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he stands in this Parliament and says to this Government that it is a mangy deal because the senators who represent the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party have agreed to support this proposition, one can only gather that he is speaking from past experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is almost impossible to believe that the congenial and lovable Fred Daly quite suddenly becomes a diabolical character who will gag a debate in a split second and deprive honourable members of the normal <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights they have to express their points of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To avoid this, they hold these little Press conferences, make Press releases and so on in an effort to sidestep the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the new Parliament 22 Liberal members and 6 Country Party members hold their seats on <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party preferences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have not described the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party as a whore or  z  harlot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was elected with the preferences of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, and to that extent he must dance to their tune. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the House knows about the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party I suppose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This opposition to the idea that the people of the Australian Capital Territory, essentially the people of Canberra, should have some <span class="highlight">democratic</span> representation in this Parliament comes from  the  Country Party,  the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Liberal Party and also from that group called the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party; the members of those Parties are the people who oppose that <span class="highlight">democratic</span> representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party vote as a party, whether they come from Tasmania or Queensland; they are Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear then to be more <span class="highlight">democratic</span> to have an even number elected each time for each Territory thus following the pattern of the major parties providing that each would have a representative in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely if the people want 2 Liberals, 2 Labor members or 2 <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party members and they vote that way they are entitled to have them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If members oppos ite really believed in <span class="highlight">democratic</span> representation for these  2  Territories they would support this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope it will see the light with respect to this legislation, pass it and give effect to a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> move designed to give to these 2 Territories the increased representation to which they are entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this country today, the task which confronts a social <span class="highlight">democratic</span> Government, dedicated to the eradication of inequality while not debasing standards, is herculean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have been particularly fair whether printing material for the Country Party, which is one of the parties in our country which receives 8 per cent of the votes and therefore should be acknowledged, or the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party which is also a party in our country which receives almost 8 per cent of the vote - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-54-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party is a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then in accordance with all the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> practices of government the Ministers submit their proposals and participate in the deliberations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that to be able to call upon reserves from within the community generally and the support of actions or the investigation of actions, is a necessary part of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> governmental process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That report culminated from an inquiry set up in 1970 in the Senate at the behest of Australian Labor PaTty senators who at that time, with the co-operation of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, had control in that place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>First, most schools lack sufficient resources, both human and material, to provide educational experiences appropriate to the young in a modern <span class="highlight">democratic</span> industrial society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The freedom of choice of individuals and students is a basic right in our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society, as is the basic right of all children to equal opportunity and equality of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I think that this Government has established its bona fides as a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government - because it has been consulting with the clients, consulting with the practitioners and seeking advice from wherever it could get it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave - As honourable mem bers will be aware, I have recently returned from a series of trade discussions in Japan, in the Republic of Korea, in the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> People’s Republic of Korea and in the People’s Republic of China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The visit to the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> People’s Republic of Korea was a particularly important one, I think, as the first visit by an Australian Minister ever to that country and as the first ever official Australian mission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the detailed discussions on trade matters with the Ministers of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> People’s Republic of Korea, we considered the question of trade representation in our 2 countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can understand the position of the Government of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> People’s Republic of Korea; in its position I probably would take a similar attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was necessary, in order to travel to the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> People’s Republic of Korea, to pass through China where I was able to renew contacts, particularly with the Chinese Minister for Foreign Trade, Minister Poi Hsiang-kuo, and with the Foreign Minister, Chi Peng Fei. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In short, under a Labor government the Industry Development Corporation will be used for the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialist purposes I outlined in my policy speech and the Act which establishes this Corporation will be amended by us to secure those purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us remember that we live in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When we talk about government control in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society we are not talking about something remote from ordinary people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No wonder the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party gave them away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The responsibility lies with the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  but he is a man who is intent on using this Parliament as a forum for his own grandiose pretensions and not as a house of legislative review, as its <span class="highlight">democratic</span> functions are prescribed under the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Political policy in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> community does not depend upon purely economic considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A body being given such wide powers, being outside the direct <span class="highlight">democratic</span> control of the electoral process must be placed in the position where people are able to comprehend the purposes of the reports brought forward and the reasons why significant changes - and no doubt there will be significant changes - are being suggested in particular industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system, fortunately, it will be done peacefully. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This House has not been able to operate according to its prescribed constitutional and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> functions as a forum of legislative review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do so because this system is most conducive to the progress and well-being of Australia and most conducive to the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> protection of the freedom of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Angas laughs but he knows that the science blocks grants were the medium used by the Liberal Party to retain the preferences of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If members opposite want to discriminate I suggest that they do the Politics I course again - that is, if they have even done it - because they will learn that if people have wealth the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way of coping with that situation is to tax them on that wealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is fair to say that most <span class="highlight">democratic</span> countries withdrew. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say in regard to his challenge to the Government to hold an election that it is quite pleasing to see that the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party in its political wisdom is too astute to fall for the stunt of the hollow challenge of the Leader of the Australian Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  to call for a double dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that the Minister for Services and Property will recognise the truth of what I have said - that it is up to the Government of the day, the Parliament or the electoral officer to provide this service to the aged, the sick and the needy and to take the matter out of the hands of the political parties because they are the ones who are presently exploiting what is surely meant to be a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me go further and remind the honourable member for Griffith of the blatant misuse of the privilege of allowing people to vote by post that was carried out during the last election campaign by his friend, the dishonourable - I mean the honourable - member for Lilley in the days of the last Parliament, Kevin Cairns, the great architect of virtue, the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party member of the last Parliament who sat in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be, otherwise it would not be distributing literature which purports to represent a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> and just point of view to the Australian people but which, in essence, is an exercise in deception as it misleads, confuses and frightens people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask honourable members opposite to consider this, for that is the view that this Association which they support puts forward - this <span class="highlight">democratic</span> association, of which the Medical Benefits Fund is a member, and of which the board of 24 members- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Every <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country has similar divisions to those embraced by the Department of Media. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They moved an amendment which I had to accept because, as is known, they had the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, which is the Country Party’s sleeping partner, sewn up in another place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That in relation to the proceedings on the following Bills, so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the House making one declaration of urgency and moving one motion for the allotment of time in respect of all the Bills: The Constitution Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill 1974, the Constitution Alteration (<span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Elections) Bill 1974 and the Constitution Alteration (Local Government Bodies) Bill 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It says that the people should not be allowed even to consider them at a referendum - perhaps one of the most <span class="highlight">democratic</span> ways of deciding things in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is the Constitution Alteration (<span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Elections) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing could be more important than the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes of Australia and nothing could be more important and indeed urgent than that the people of Australia should be entitled to consider these propositions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Constitution Alteration (<span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Elections) Bill 1974: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Secondary Industry  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  said in regard to a previous motion that a referendum is the most <span class="highlight">democratic</span> form of getting decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposal - that which is called the simultaneous elections proposal - should be rejected on 2 grounds: firstly, because it is unnecessary; and secondly, because its adoption would be dangerous in constitutional and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I believe that we are deceiving ourselves if we think that because of voting fatigue the Australian people will surrender any part of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> tradition of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not wish to surrender any part of that <span class="highlight">democratic</span> status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe also that, if approved, the proposals will represent a great step forward in the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process, with consequent benefit to the Parliament, the people and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is utter nonsense for the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  to say that this is something to foster and to further the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> exercise of the will of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">democratic</span> will of the people can be exercised as the Constitution is now framed and those who are in government at any time can exercise any of those 3 options which are available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that when a Senate election takes place at the time of a House of Representatives election the very nature of this chamber, the nature of the election of government, the nature of policies that originate in this chamber and the machinations of power that those who abuse it in the Labor Party seek, are likely to distort the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process, and particularly the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process that applies to the election of senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason, I see it as being quite undemocratic and against the maintenance of a bicameral system that this piece of legislation should be either passed by this House or accepted by the Australian electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will find that Australians have sufficient intelligence to appreciate that separate Senate elections, should they be a part of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process and they still are, provide some benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one considers the Nazi Party one has to take the view that it is hardly in the same accord or category of organisations as would be called political parties because it rests almost entirely on a principle of violence, racism, anti-semitism, the repudiation of all <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles, the fuehrer principle and the negation of everything which the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles reflect and for which this Parliament, for example, stands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, the Prime Minister - will no longer have the pretence of representing the free <span class="highlight">democratic</span> majority of people of this free and independent country of ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, in the Committe’s opinion, more in accord with <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle and the develop ments since Federation that it should be sufficient to obtain separate majorities in at least one half of the number of States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee’s proposal would not disturb the federal fabric of the Constitution, inherent in Section 128, but its proposal would serve to lay more emphasis on constitutional change by the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process of majority vote than there at present exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this change will bring the constitutional provisions more into accord with the spirit of the founders in 1901; more into accord with today’s mood of national awareness; and more into accord with <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles and processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill will join the three proposals for alteration of the Constitution at present before the House - the proposals for simultaneous elections of the Senate and the House of Representatives, for <span class="highlight">democratic</span> electorates, and for powers in relation to local government finances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the two changes to section 128 of the Constitution contained in this Bill will put referendums on a more <span class="highlight">democratic</span> basis and make it more possible for the Constitution to reflect more accurately, in contemporary terms, the spirit and the fact of Australia as one united nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that the words ‘and democratically’ should be included in the long title because they carry a very clear inference that the elections until now have not been carried out democratically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A curious result of this is that the Government is alleging that it was not democratically elected and that by the amendment of the Constitution there will be henceforth <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we do now is to distribute electoral boundaries on the basis of the number of electors because we believe that is the proper and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way to do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that it is a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> proposition to determine electorates on the basis of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The concept of equality is the distinguishing feature of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party candidate who was defeated got 48 per cent of the primary votes and the Liberal Party candidate polled 24 per cent, with the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party candidate getting 8 per cent and the Independent candidate 6 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One way of judging whether we have a fair and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> electoral system is to relate the percentage of votes won by a party to the seats gained by it at an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These figures show why the 20 per cent rural weighting of electorates must be retained at all costs - a measure which the Senate recently rejected for a second time but which this <span class="highlight">democratic</span> Government voted for and so did the honourable member for Mackellar in one of his brighter moments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, by the method of dividing a State into two unequal zones, electors in these zones are given different values for the vote which they cast in a system which is supposedly <span class="highlight">democratic</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proof is easy to come by, and events in the world of today are clear testimony to the fact that administering the government of each and every <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country raises intractable problems and is better in the hands and minds of many representatives of the people than in the vanity of the few. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last year, referring to Labor Party policy on <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialism, he said that it would be intolerable if a Labor Government were to use the alibi of the Constitution to excuse failure- to achieve its socialist objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason for the proposed referendum is that the Labor Party wants to achieve its purposes for ulterior reasons contrary to the best interests of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system of Government in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Supporters of the Government believe that this is the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that this, in turn, will lead to the conduct of truly <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections by applying the principle of one vote one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The result of this election illustrates the detrimental effect to <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections that the political racketeers achieved in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In <span class="highlight">democratic</span> Queensland, where the Country Party is in control of the coalition, the Country Party gained 181,288 votes - less than 20 per cent of the total vote - and won 26 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If this legislation is passed, if the Constitution is altered and then legislation is passed pursuant to that power, it will be to the great disadvantage of the people of Australia who want the services, and it will be to the great disadvantage also of those people of Australia who see our Constitution as a bulwark which is essential for the protection of our standards, our way of life and our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> centralisation of power in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would seem that the Liberal-Country Party Coalition with the help of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party is going to throw this proposal out when a harnessing of savings is sorely needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that spokesmen for the Liberal and Australian Country Parties and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party have decided that the answer to the present second rate pensioner medical service, which they uncritically supported during the previous Government’s term of office, is to enrol pensioners in the subsidised health benefits plan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, in the Committee’s opinion, more in accord with <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle and the developments since Federation that it should be sufficient to obtain separate majorities in at least one half of the number of States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My point is that even then, under no real threat, the founding fathers provided for a majority of the States in a referendum as a sensible way to provide for <span class="highlight">democratic</span> dealings between what would be regarded as equal members in a partnership who had decided for certain important and overriding reasons to come together to form a federal union but for other purposes to retain their separate existence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are, in fact, talcing a major <span class="highlight">democratic</span> step in placing these ballot papers before the citizens of Australia and asking them to make judgment upon the questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, if honourable members read Quick and Garran and understand the constitutional principles and the realities of a federal and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system that guided the fathers of the Constitution, they must come to the conclusion that before a referendum is put to the Australian people they must be informed of exactly what is involved in the proposed change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is, in the Committee’s opinion, more in accord with <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle and the developments since Federation that it should be sufficient to obtain separate majorities in at least one-half of the number of States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the great features of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system of government is that there is in the Parliament an Opposition, and the duty of that Opposition is to present an alternative to the proposals put forward by the Government, to criticise those proposals and to present the point of view of the sections of the community and the electors that Opposition members have the privilege to represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The figures relating to the Gosford electorate were:  Mr Brooks,  Liberal, received 10,319 votes or 52.4 per cent of the vote;  Mr Dunbar,  <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party received 637 votes or 3.2 per cent of the vote; and  Mr McGowan,  Australian Labor Party, received 8,744 votes or 44.4 per cent of the vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The true situation is that there was a march and it was organised by the Liberal Party and the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party combined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All our talk of millions of extra dollars should not be allowed to hide the fact that what we are really aiming at is a cultural, social and economic revolution in our society with a new respect for the rights of every individual, not just an elite, to have the opportunity of living a personally satisfying life as a member of a genuinely <span class="highlight">democratic</span> community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What the Opposition parties have succeeded in doing is not bringing about a mere delay but, by their persuasive arguments and of course by the numbers that they could mount in the other place, bring pressure to bear in the most <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way possible to have legislation properly amended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The clear implication was that this Government was elected undemocratically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Authority also said that from experience in our type of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society, planning control can arrest the rate of such development but cannot prevent it when land is in private ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the finish the question of equity or balance between the two is the greatest single social economic question that faces a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> choice, but it is a choice that ought to be exercised sensibly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is, in the Committee’s opinion, more in accord with <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle and the developments since <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Just as the Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  showed a proper spirit of the workings of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> parliament by accepting about 25 amendments that had been moved by our colleagues in the Senate and by accepting the deletion of another 20 clauses from the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, so too should the Acting Minister for Education  (Mr Lionel Bowen). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All the Government needs to do is to give the people of Australia at a referendum’ which he described in the same speech as perhaps one of the most <span class="highlight">democratic</span> ways of deciding things in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society’ - the opportunity to consider three propositions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The position of the Opposition, and its allies in the AMA, the private funds, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party and the private hospitals is that there is nothing wrong with the present scheme which a further reckless infusion of public money would not fix. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only recently many Queenslanders were dismayed at the ruthlessness with which the Bjelke-Petersen Government - apparently the honourable member for Darling Downs thinks that great <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government in Queensland is a wonderful government - bludgeoned through the State Assembly a resolution opposing the conferral of powers sought by this Federal Government under section 128 of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member may support the Bill which has been introduced in another place by the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, by which it is proposed that the Australian Government subsidise private insurance contributions of families on incomes up to $69.50 a week and single persons up to $30 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People in Australia, living in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society, have had the choice provided by a dual hospital system - public hospitals and private hospitals run mainly by religious organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact the amendments in relation to the identification of people on the Commission were moved by the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party in the Senate and we supported them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have seen in the year that is behind us many moves which could be interpreted in that way - moves which on the surface seem fair and reasonable and attractive enough but when they are put together into a pattern seem to move towards this funda mental Government objective of destroying the Australian States, destroying every other form of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government and centralising everything here in Canberra in one House of Parliament so that the man who obtained the Prime Ministership by some quirk or chance of fate will be able to perpetuate his power, be able to over-ride everything in the Constitution and have complete control of the whole Australian economy, social structure, family life and everything else that one can imagine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Sometimes the reports that we read of our speeches are not what we would have written if we had been writing them, but I think all of us would say that the job done by the Press is absolutely essential to the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process so that what happens here can, through the judgment and interpretative pen of the Press, reach all the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From an examination of the functions of the Branch which consisted of three persons, it seemed clear to me that certain of its activities amounted to political surveillance and were therefore incompatible with the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-72-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 4 December 1973 the Senate referred to the Senate Standing Commitee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs the Constitution Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill, rejected the Constitution Alteration (<span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Elections) Bill, rejected the Constitution Alteration (Local Government Bodies) Bill and amended the Constitution Alteration (Mode of Altering the Constitution) Bill, amendments which were rejected by this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us consider next the Constitution Alteration (<span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Elections) Bill 1974 (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask honourable members on the opposite side who sit behind the Leader of the Opposition to examine the figures for Queensland to see whether there are not gerrymanders and whether there is no necessity for <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So do not let us talk about <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was talking about this so-called <span class="highlight">democratic</span> structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think the time is overdue that the people of Australia should see all houses of parliament elected in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This cognate debate covers the Constitution Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill, the Constitution Alteration (<span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Elections) Bill, the Constitution Alteration (Local Government Bodies) Bill and the Constitution Alteration (Mode of Altering the Constitution) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have pledged ourselves to this reform and we are seeking to make this reform in our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly I would like to deal with the Bill which has a very curious reference in its title to <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections - the Constitution Alteration (<span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Elections) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what the proposal is all about, no matter what fancy language the Prime Minister might use about <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government hopes that the Australian people, through ignorance of what they are doing, will become accomplices in the Labor Party’s plans to seriously damage the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this proposal is put into effect we will see the Labor Party gaining enormous advantage at the cost of sound and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> electoral principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a revelation of the Labor Party’s professed respect and manifest contempt for <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that they have lost control of this House the Liberal and Country Parties and their <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party running mates - the wedding mate of the Country Party - are abusing the power of the Senate to frustrate the popular will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is inherent in our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process that such an issue, involving an amendment of the Constitution, can be decided only by the people and I express the hope that this House will adopt a responsible attitude in allowing the early passage of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now turn to the Constitution Alteration (<span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Elections) Bill 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The word <span class="highlight">democratic</span>’ frightens every Country Party member in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These measures will place <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institutions in Australia on a firmer foundation and will forestall the possibility of democracy being usurped by totalitarian parties of the right or the left. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do honourable members opposite oppose that <span class="highlight">democratic</span> move? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The method by which a Constitution can be changed is, therefore, of great <span class="highlight">democratic</span> importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is obviously more <span class="highlight">democratic</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is time this fundamental <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right was given to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask all those honourable members opposite who do not trust the Australian people and say that they should not be given a vote on these great <span class="highlight">democratic</span> proposals to stand and be counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Constitution Alteration (<span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Elections) Bill is equally deceptive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It represents a departure from <span class="highlight">democratic</span> theory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the second reading stage of the Constitution Alteration (<span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Elections) Bill the Leader of the Opposition, the right honourable Leader of the Australian Country Party  (Mr Anthony),  the right honourable member for Lowe  (Mr McMahon)  and the honourable member for Moreton spoke, and in the Committee stage of that Bill the Leader of the Opposition spoke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the other chamber, which is controlled by the Liberal and Country parties, the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party and a few Independents - not the newly elected Government - the legislation was thrown back and tonight and this afternoon we hear these great protectors of liberty now saying that this Parliament is being destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Constitution Alteration (<span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Elections) Bill 1974- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is unable to ensure that the processes of a democratically elected Upper House are allowed to take their proper course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it tries - and this is the only way in which it can do it  -  to steamroll the measure through this House, thereby denying any effective <span class="highlight">democratic</span> discussion on what are very fundamental constitutional issues to the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe - and we have said for the last 10 years, since the United States Supreme Court, the Warren Court, first laid down this interpretation - that it ought to be put in the Constitution so that elected persons can no longer disregard this proper <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, in the Committee’s opinion, more in accord with <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle and the developments since Federation that it should be sufficient to obtain separate majorities in at least onehalf of the number of States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly we have discussed the grossly misnamed Constitution Alteration (<span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Elections) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make it clear that the Opposition parties intend to ensure that the Parliament performs its constitutional and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The consequence of the interpretation of the statistics presented to us by the Leader of the House is that this chamber has in fact not been able to exercise that which I have just stated to be its <span class="highlight">democratic</span> responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This again proves the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> nature of sport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to make sure that our policy of catering for the needs of the various associations and organisations and for the recreational needs of the urban and rural areas upholds this <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, such action could well be a safety valve in our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system providing it is kept within certain limits and does not infringe the rights and safety of other citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second part of the paragraph contained in the Speech from which I have just quoted to the House refers to <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, it is to be expected, I suppose, that the Country Party in particular, the most conservative organisation in Australia - I am reminded by a colleague that it is a reactionary party and that is quite the right description - is now joining with the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, of all parties, and the National Civic Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will campaign - I say this for the benefit of the people and to assist the Country Party - in the Senate election in May under the name of Country Party, except in Queensland where it will run a joint ticket with the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party under the name of the National Alliance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that in respect of the 1974 Senate election, on 10 March the Country Party and the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party announced that they would be running a joint ticket under the name of the National Alliance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increasingly in all the countries of the European Economic Community, in Scandinavia and throughout the Englishspeaking democracies, there is a mood of disillusionment and cynicism about members of parliament, the institution of parliament and the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party has no time for the Labor Party either. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to talk on many other matters, but I do want to say that the people of Queensland are sick and tired of a government which is trying to take away their rights and which loses no opportunity to denigrate their Premier and their Government and to impose a system that is not <span class="highlight">democratic</span> but is the very antithesis of democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member who said this neglected to mention that the Labor Premier of the time is no longer a member of the Labor Party but is in fact a member of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party - and that last Saturday, next Saturday or the Saturday after that he did or will marry into the Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one member represents 15 times the number of electors represented by another member who has equal voting on the floor of the Parliament, the Parliament is not democratically elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can rationalise that in any way one likes by using percentages, but the facts are that if the system is to be <span class="highlight">democratic</span> every person who is above the age at which a vote is allowed and is an Australian citizen or a British subject is entitled to vote, and any diminution of that right to have a full vote in the election of a parliament is a denial of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that this surely is good government; this is truly <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, as we all know, wiser counsel prevailed in the Australian Country Party and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party and the Bills were eventually passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They support the proposition put by the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party in the Senate in relation to health insurance funds at a cost of $ 1,400m in one year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it does we will forever end the cry that undemocratic elections have taken place and governments which have no right to govern are in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Western Australia the differential between the largest and the smallest seat in the upper House is 15 to one - a range of 85,000 votes down to 5,000, and that is a greater differential than any <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system can stand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fortunately the pressures of public opinion have forced a change in that State and a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system will replace the present archaic and undemocratic upper House in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other proposals are to allow an interchange of powers between the Commonwealth Parliament and the State parliaments and to ensure that members of the House of Representatives and members of the parliaments of the States are chosen directly and democratically by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently they agree that the people of Australia should have the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right to elect representatives to the Federal Parliament and to the State parliaments on the basis of electors or population rather than as has been the case in the past, on the basis of gerrymandered boundaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who but the present Opposition would oppose the Bills by which we propose to change the Constitution or attempt to deny to the people of Australia the benefits and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights to which they are entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of self-preservation, they will try to oppose these great measures which will bring our electoral laws to the point where they are <span class="highlight">democratic</span> and constitutionally correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The way to <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government is not sectional rule from one area of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot think of anything that gives me more sorrow than to see the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process and parliamentary process so denied to the people of Australia as it has been recently on a great series of debates, which I will not bore the House by mentioning because they are well known to all honourable members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman asks me about the Bill to ensure that there are <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections in the House of Representatives and in every State Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a provision by which the Warren Court has transformed the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process in the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly the people will be given the opportunity to see that the Australian Constitution should be as <span class="highlight">democratic</span> as the Supreme Court of the United States insists that the American Constitution should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been a government that even now is denying the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process through the assertion of a series of referenda, each of which is designed in total to deny an opportunity of electoral change in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not once in the Liberal-Country Party coalition Government’s 23 years in office was this <span class="highlight">democratic</span> offer extended to the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This profoundly <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle has given the British people inspiration, individualism and direction for over 600 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Labor Party was defeated in 1970 the Hall Government realised that while the Liberals held power by this unfair and undemocratic system they could not hold up their heads in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not so long ago they accepted an alteration to the Legislative Council which should give us a fairer <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system in South Australia and which should reflect the wishes of the South Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The firm said that it would not have mattered what we did; members of the business community are so strongly engrained in their prejudice against a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialist party that even if they were quadrupling their profits they would not have liked us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number one objective of the Australian Labor Party is to achieve the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange - in other words, government ownership of industry, production, distribution and exchange or, in simpler terms, of everybody and everything. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On a matter like this we ought to be reasonable enough to accept the fact that though the Government’s program is not entirely in line with everything that the Opposition did when it was in government, and if it can be shown that the program being put forward by the Govern ment is the program which was contained in the Government’s printed platform when it went to the electorate, then unless there is a very compelling reason for doing otherwise, the Opposition ought to be <span class="highlight">democratic</span> enough to say: ‘You have a mandate to do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The title of the third Bill includes the words ‘<span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Elections’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that not even the Liberal Party or the Country Party would now cavil at the use of the word ‘<span class="highlight">democratic</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that this Parliament and all the mainland State parliaments are not elected by <span class="highlight">democratic</span> means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can tell honourable members that all the time the people of Perth can be given to stimulate their interest and to afford them opportunities to engage in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> participation undoubtedly will be warmly welcomed by them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regard this as a very important <span class="highlight">democratic</span> component of the entire argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Committee will preside over an inquiry which will be extremely <span class="highlight">democratic</span> in nature - in fact, unprecedented in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also want to know how often the same results occur, and whether parties or leaders have replaced one another by <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless the country is very small, the more secondary elections there are, and the more power the winners gain by election, the more <span class="highlight">democratic</span> we assume the society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although this control may -be carefully hedged about with legal restrictions, only in a few states with long and continuous <span class="highlight">democratic</span> conditions of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> abstinence, such as Great Britain, are we reassured by legal guarantees of impartiality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fiji has an admirable <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not likely tobe very <span class="highlight">democratic</span>, either. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many years now we have heard from members of the Opposition as they then were but who are now members of the Government that the important principle in any <span class="highlight">democratic</span> situation should be the principle of one vote-one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the way boundaries will be drawn under these proposals which stupidly enough are labelled a ‘referendum for <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections’ one will find that the result will be biased away from the principle of one vote- one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us couple that situation with the referendum for so-called <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, the referendum for so-called <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections will base electorates on total populace including those below 18 years of age which will give a biased result in some inner city suburbs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On such occasions we remember and reflect on the traditional and strong ties which Australia has with France, our common values, our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way of life, our respect for and our affinities with the civilisation and cultural heritage that is France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For long Georges Pompidou was largely the figure who ensured the survival of the De Gaulle Government during a period in France when the forces for the complete disunity of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government in France were at their greatest strength. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one examines recent history and what is happening abroad and one looks, for instance, at Conservative or Labour governments in the United Kingdom or <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> or Republican administrations in the USA one sees that the ruling rate of interest has been rising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If in the Senate  all members of the Liberal Party, the Australian Country Party and the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party oppose the Appropriation Bills they will fail to pass. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will tell the people that there is nothing to be ashamed of in profit - normal legitimate business profit; that the profit of enterprise is the source of all forward movement and is the basis of any <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate, dominated by the Opposition and its acolytes in the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, sold out not to the public interest but to minority privileged interests in the community - to the Australian Medical Association, the Society of General Practitioners of Australia, and to the health insurance funds which are over stuffed with reserves which belong to the contributors <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-We intend to demonstrate to the Australian public that it does not have a universal health insurance scheme because of the intransigence, because of the political opportunism of the Opposition and its camp followers in the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One proposal - that of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, which I understand has some attractions for the Opposition - would cost an additional $180m at least, which represents nearly a 2 per cent increase in taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat again that the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party seems to have some vague suggestions about how this can be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>States House - the Liberal Party, the Country Party and the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party took it on themselves to disown what was agreed to by the leader of every State government in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly the term ‘one vote, one value’ has no precise meaning, lt is jargon which is wheeled out to raise to the surface the proper ideals that people have for a more <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system, to gain . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Rather than deprive the people of the Territory of any <span class="highlight">democratic</span> representation whatsoever in the next Parliament, the Government is by this Bill seeking to adopt the Committee’s original proposals as the basis for returning 2 members for the Territory, should this be necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With cynical contempt for the will of the people, with total disregard for the traditions of the Westminster parliamentary system, the Opposition has put itself on a collision course with stable government and with all Australians who uphold the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> parlia- mentary process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With the aid of the universally discredited Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party the Opposition has already set out to mutilate, sabotage and frustrate the Australian Government’s legislative program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because the Prime Minister knew that he could not gain control of the Senate by <span class="highlight">democratic</span> means - by the popular vote of all the people of Australia - he sought to buy a House of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has not attempted to deal constructively with the health care problems facing this nation but it is trying to force the people of Australia into a corner so that private hospitals, freedom of choice and the things that we have come to expect as being essential to a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society will end in domination by Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet there are people who sit in the other place who were elected years ago and who seek to bring down this Government for reasons which the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  mentioned are completely contrary to every <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to delay the House any longer on these events which led to this crisis in the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process of this country where the Prime Minister by his action and his colleagues by their actions brought us to a situation in which it was necessary for us to put the question to the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since when has it been part of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> theory that a government should be put into power and never touched by the Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When was it <span class="highlight">democratic</span> theory that the people should have no opportunity, when the Parliament gave them that opportunity, to have another look at a government which had been elected democratically? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Far from this being the case, it is the very heart of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> theory that a parliament should make a government look down the barrel of a gun. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are extraordinarily fortunate that this is a country which has a democratically elected lower House and a democratically elected upper House, that it has no House of Lords and that there is an opportunity for the people, where there is a basic and real impasse in the government of the country, to be given another chance to have a say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not saying that there is not a need in this respect, but I am saying that this is shabby treatment of a Committee which in the past has set a standard in the operation of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process of which the House and the Parliament has every reason to be proud. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The unruly elements that have come to the fore in this House in an endeavour to frustrate the very <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes that they now profess to support have been very firmly put in their places by my good colleague and friend  Mr Scholes,  and I have no doubt that after his appointment to this high and important office today he will again deal with those elements in the firm, fair and just way in which he has dealt with them in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No one is suggesting that there ought to be or that there is need for such a wide variation in enrolments in Australia as apply to those other countries, but the figures I have quoted illustrate the way in which other countries of similar tradition to our own and with no less attachment to <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles than we have, apply their electoral laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it does not, of course we can hold a joint meeting of both Houses at which we would have an absolute majority and we would then be able to pass the legislation and get on and ensure proper parliamentary elections and decent <span class="highlight">democratic</span> procedures in this Parliament at least. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I do suggest that members who were influential on the side of the Liberal Party, either inside the parliamentary party or more likely in the Senate, and in the departed Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, received a significant amount of those consultant’s fees for advice on how best to defeat the Labor Party’s health scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although the reason for the election on the last occasion was surprising, those who have seen the results and participated in the election will agree that so far as  Senator McManus  and the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party are concerned it was the wrong time, the wrong election and the wrong result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let it be understood that this Joint Sitting is a last resort, a means provided by the Constitution to enable the popular will- the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process- ultimately to prevail over the tactics of blind obstruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the so-called <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections referendum was passed it would allow electorates to be based not on the number of voters but on the number of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What had been a reasonable discretion allowed to the Commissioners became a direction to them to do what is neither reasonable nor <span class="highlight">democratic</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gives to those who sit in this Parliament at this historic Joint Sitting of this Parliament the opportunity to stand up and be counted, to say whether they believe in these <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles and, above all, in the supreme principle of one vote one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal was put in propaganda terms to be very <span class="highlight">democratic</span> because the numbers in electorates would be closer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fortunately the people of Australia were not hoodwinked, even by the name of the referendum proposal which described it as a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> amendment to the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equality of political rights is inherent in a truly <span class="highlight">democratic</span> state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equality of political rights is a matter that must be guaranteed under the law in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party could not care less about the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights of Australian citizens to enjoy equality of representation in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Free elections are basic to a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition Parties have undermined the basic <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles of elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having taken the proposal for the Joint Sitting once to the High Court, it has even said it is going to take it there again and so deny the people their <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill gives to this historic Joint Meeting of the Australian Parliament the opportunity to give expression to the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle that a person ‘s vote is of equal value no matter where he is domiciled and whatever his class, creed or occupation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill gives expression to the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles of equal rights for all people, as opposed to the manipulation of the electoral system for the benefit of political parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its endorsement now by this Joint Session would, we believe, place at risk the very basis of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process which this Parliament is to uphold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, both in its attempts to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act and in its unsuccessful proposals to amend the Commonwealth Constitution, has exhibited a total disregard for the principles of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the fourth paragraph, when he was talking about the referendum concerning <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections, he said: This represents a fundamental departure from the principle of one vote one value- the only right and proper principle on which to base electoral redistribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They can then service their constituents and not come into this House with a weighted vote which goes against every principle of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections which we hold dear in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The combined vote of the Country Party, the Liberal Party and the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party over Australia, is very much less than 50 per cent of the total. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact of the total votes polled, the Australian Labor Party polled about 250,000 more than the combined votes of the Liberal Party, the Country Party and the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a most important part of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> structure that governments should be elected on the basis of one person one vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In every single case that has been before the United States Supreme Court it has made the same decision- that the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> concept will not tolerate the gerrymandering of politicians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">democratic</span> state has inherent in its concept that all citizens will have an equal voice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that every person who believes in the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> concept will vote for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been reelected on a fair and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> basis and it has been re-elected with a job to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He would wish to be able to denigrate the Senate in carrying out its constitutional function which has just been reinforced by the people of Australia in a fully <span class="highlight">democratic</span> vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are regarded as one of the stable nations of the world because all previous governments in this country have respected our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institution, our electoral boundaries and our electoral system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a simple <span class="highlight">democratic</span> measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Representation of the people in the national Parliament lies at the heart of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no obstructionism from the Senate if we are democrats and recognise that the voice of the people can be expressed in 2 chambers each elected on a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To interpose into the Senate representatives of the Territories is to break the Federal contact and to deny to the States the opportunity through equal electorates to ensure that by an equally <span class="highlight">democratic</span> base there is a voice which can be put alongside the voice of the people not divided into States as electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1970, the then Leader of the Opposition- the present Prime Minister- tried again, out of a recognition of the pretty fundamental and basic fact that a large number of people in the Northern Territory and in the Australian Capital Territory are without their <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to stop the passage of our measures, every action must be invoked to prevent the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights of the people being enacted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  said the other day, the real crisis in this country at the moment is the threat to <span class="highlight">democratic</span> order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cares nothing for <span class="highlight">democratic</span> reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are they not really saying that what they are after is domination of a chamber which, for the time being, they see as frustrating them in their attempts to distort completely the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What utter nonsense it is to hear the honourable member for Canberra and Minister for Manufacturing Industry comment on the Statement of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  that the real crisis is the threat to <span class="highlight">democratic</span> order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it does not enhance the opportunities for <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have been denied this <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right for 63 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Bill will have to go through the normal <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes of Government, the media, and public opinion, which finally determines our actions in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, despite what their Party thought of the merits of this Bill, the Country Party senators were persuaded by  Senator Withers  to join his squalid conspiracy against <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it has been obstructionist, and it is quite clear that it will continue to be so to the detriment of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If ever there was a Bill which gave people the opportunity to show where they stood on basic <span class="highlight">democratic</span> matters and on matters of discrimination, this is it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen the members of the Opposition come forward with a whole range of rather spurious, irrational, illogical and quite undemocratic propositions and arguments which reflect little credit on their intelligence or their integrity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this Bill merely provides for the anticipated normal progress and development of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society- a society which seeks to avoid discrimination against any section of its people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet today, in the country which Lord Bryce, I think it was, in 1911 said was the most <span class="highlight">democratic</span> in the world, we have listened to the representatives of the Liberal Party and the Country Party denouncing the proposal as a parliamentary plot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Participation is the very essence of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> contract. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They did this, not because of any <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle, but because all they believe in is the gerrymander. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, after all, in many respects the members on the Opposition side are quite correct in loathing <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their loathing of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government is not just some mere quirk, some mere eccentricity on their part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason they loathe <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government is that they know that ultimately with <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government the obsolete ideas and the selfish interests which they represent in this place will be swept away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We support <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government because we believe that this country should be governed by the people . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government is the only form of government which the Australian people are entitled to have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Democratic</span> government is a goal for which we shall continue to struggle despite all of the opposition of the moth-eaten, moss-backed reactionaries sitting on the left of the  Chairman  of this Joint Sitting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From 1949 to 1968 when both of those seats were held by the Australian Labor Party the Opposition did not believe in <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason has nothing to do with democracy or <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles, because if ever there was a bunch of politicians in this country lacking in principle it is those on the other side of the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only a few months ago it supported the legislation but now suddenly we find that the legislation is against all <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was derisory laughter when  Senator James  McClelland called for the abolition of the Senate and then said that while it exists it should be <span class="highlight">democratic</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By bludgeoning through the Parliament such wide ranging powers, without consultation with the State governments or the industry, in a Bill with such wide ramifications the Government is making a sham of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposal offends the principles of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights which we believe are so precious to a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society, and mean so very much to the spirit and the life of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is described as blugeoning legislation through this Parliament by the sheer weight of numbers but it is an example of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process working more thoroughly and at greater length than I think it has ever done in this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in a country with a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system of government- although one has some doubt about this when one has regard to Government policies- this can be achieved only through the recognised process of extensive consultation with the industries involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe in the community interest-an interest arrived at in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make the point that this is <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialism and we are proud of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is room for both public and private participation in aU spheres so long as it is clearly understood that <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialism means that the private sphere must work within national indicative planning guidelines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The system in Australia is the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process, the Parliamentary process, and if that is to blame we need a debate about it here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The system is the institutions in this country and the major institution in Australia is the democratically elected Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Local government bodies ought to recognise now, if they had not done so before, just how important it is that the Senate be as it is and not controlled by the Labor centralists and socialists of this nation who are trying to destroy our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system through a process of anarchy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cause of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialism throughout the world has lost one of its pillars of strength and sources of inspiration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Personally, I have a lot more faith in the ability of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> governments to survive those forebodings and I hope that with a little co-operation and understanding of the basic problems those events will not overwhelm the Western world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is not necessary to destroy an important human principle that is essential to a free and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Depending on the findings that the committee of inquiry hands down and how this House accepts those findings, there could arise a ludicrous situation which would be against the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he stands for election as a member of Parliament, as part of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process, this man can be blackguarded and pilloried by mean minded candidates who happen to be standing against him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is primarily for this reason that I believe the interests of Parliament, as an essential part of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process, will be best served by opening up the process to the scrutiny of the community by such action as televising parliamentary sessions with careful consideration being given to those sessions selected for viewing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The real difference between the 2 systems of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government in the world is in the nature of the powers, privileges, responsibilities and weaknesses of the head of government, in our case the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They illustrate that although there are many weaknesses in the parliamentary system of government, some of which were spoken about this afternoon in the debate on the estimates for the Parliament, the parliamentary system of government based on a party system- I make no apology for supporting a party system of government, and I do not have any undying allegiance to a 2 party system of government as many of those who sit opposite have- contains flexible, responsive checks and balances carried through into the chamber of Parliament which other systems of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government throughout the world do not have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that this matter has been raised in the Parliament on a number of occasions but when one takes into account the fact that a political party such as the Australian Labor Party has been out of office from 1949 to 1972 for all sorts of reasons, including the actions of and collaboration between the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party and the present Opposition Parties, one must concede that it only stands to reason that a Prime Minister coming into office after such a period would want to have serving under him a mixture of people he has worked with previously and people to whom he has been introduced after he has taken up his new post. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that one thing which has to happen in most Western <span class="highlight">democratic</span> industrialised systems is that those on low levels of income must have their standards raised relatively and that, unless there is an increase in the total size of the national income, if there is an increase going to those on lower levels, obviously there must be some sacrifice on the part of those at higher levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At last an Australian Government is not under pressure from extreme reactionary pressure groups such as the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, the National Civic Council and the rest, and an Australian Government is prepared to initiate policies which it considers are in the best interests of Australia and particularly of the future generations of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In contrast to the Opposition which clearly is set to divide country and city because it wishes to maintain its shrinking power base- to demonstrate the lengths it will go to maintain that shrinking power base I need only mention that it would decimate the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle of one vote one value- and vilify our policies for the rural sector, quite conveniently forgetting to point out the millions of dollars that are injected into the rural area through the several programs of the Government, and in particular the combined and integrated programs of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development, the Government, through the Minister, has undertaken detailed negotiations with the State governments and local governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because arrangements had been made according to the formula of balance for the admission of the five new States (Federal Republic of Germany, German <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Republic, Iran, Peru and Zaire) to the CCD before the Australian application was submitted, it was not possible to secure membership of the CCD for Australia this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-36-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I can assure them that under the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> proposals of the present Whitlam Government such a state of affairs will never happen in the Federal arena where people will have to get the majority of the votes to get the results that are necessary in any democracy, and that is <span class="highlight">democratic</span> majority rule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It always seems to me rather odd that when one brings in the concept of consultation and the fulfilment of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes, members of the LiberalCountry Party Opposition are the first to oppose it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we are seeking is a broadening of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, this intended modification to the existing exhaustive preferential voting system is also aimed at allowing electors the maximum degree of choice in exercising their <span class="highlight">democratic</span> voting rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I accept <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialism but the honourable member for Boothby did not use the term in that way; he used it in a pejorative sense and I do not think that it adds to proper argument and debate in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do so because this system is most conducive to the progress and the well-being of Australia, and most conducive to the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> protection of the freedom of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When one rises in the House, as I frequently do, to speak on these matters with the sole objective of preserving our cherished <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system, one finds opposition from members opposite, such as the opposition which has been raised by the honourable member for Parramatta. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a redistribution has not taken place since 1968 and the previous Government sidestepped its obligation, this Government sees no reason to follow that example and in accordance with the practice to bring in <span class="highlight">democratic</span> voting the Government has introduced the proposals for a redistribution of electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Australian people are to continue to live in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society it is fundamental that all areas of the media, in particular television and films as well as the Press, should be allowed to remain free from ministerial guidance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whichever way one looks at it, I do not know how any person who calls himself a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialist could possibly support people who have proven on the one hand that they do not practise any of the principles that we of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialist movement throughout the world or in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country like Australia profess to support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course I am a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that the day will come when we will have a system of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialism in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is true that I said that we could not introduce <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialism immediately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that we will have to wait indefinitely because I could not imagine that it would be possible in the present climate to get the necessary referendum carried to give the Australian Parliament the power to introduce <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is what they are opposing because the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party is starting to lose its influence- the Party that used to endorse everybody whose name began with ‘A’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his protesting too much I think the honourable member reveals why the Government is pressing this Bill through with indecent haste- that is, that the system, as the honourable member for Port Adelaide pointed out, works against certain Labor electorates with the percentage of informal votes, and what is being dressed up in the cause of a very <span class="highlight">democratic</span> and just procedure is really something that Labor wants to alter in some ways because it can see some advantage to itself in these alterations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that the right to vote was one of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights of every Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe every <span class="highlight">democratic</span> Australian should insist on his right to record a vote irrespective of what country he is in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One reads about the Labour Party in Britain and Parties in some other countries saying that compulsory voting is not <span class="highlight">democratic</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Optional preferential voting is less <span class="highlight">democratic</span> for 2 very good reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is less <span class="highlight">democratic</span> for a second very good reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that the system is less <span class="highlight">democratic</span> because there is very rarely, if ever, a 50 per cent vote for the government there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government wants the most <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system I think the inverse preferential system is easily the most <span class="highlight">democratic</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members should not laugh at this suggestion because this is accepted by a large number of organisations as the most <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of them say it is far more <span class="highlight">democratic</span> than first past the post voting, so let us not hear any nonsense about first past the post, disguised as optional preferential, voting being considered more <span class="highlight">democratic</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The best way to be completely <span class="highlight">democratic</span> and to cut out any advantage which somebody might gain because of his name is to have a circular paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No other country, no other civilised <span class="highlight">democratic</span> nation would accept such a stupid position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe also that reduction of the informal vote is desirable because it will significantly reduce the time taken in counting the ballot papers, in counting the votes, in determining the result of an election, and that is important in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I thought that we were interested not only in taxpayers but also in achieving <span class="highlight">democratic</span> results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it might be significant for them to think again about what is proposed here and to see how <span class="highlight">democratic</span> the proposals really are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is singularly undemocratic and it is something that we seek to abolish in the amendment proposed to this Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should have the opportunity once again to cast a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> vote without the surveillance of party scrutineers and without the watchful eye of the Liberal Party canvassers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly it has been happening in Victoria with respect to the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I use the obvious example of the 2 parties which had substantial minority votes in the last election- the Australian Party and the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the facts are that people are disadvantaged and are placed under stress by electoral laws which require them to undertake a too complicated system of voting, especially in Senate elections, and I believe that these amendments will assist greatly in simplifying the system so that all people will have their <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right to vote, and vote formally, and will not have it taken away from them on a mere pointless technicality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If optional preferential voting is what the Labor Party calls a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> vote, all I can say is that it is horribly like <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The word ‘<span class="highlight">democratic</span>’ is used, but for what purpose I am not too sure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly support the postponement of the consideration of the Bill so that we on this side of the House can have a thorough look at it and get some indication from the Minister and officers of the Department as to whether some of the things I have mentioned would be worth looking at and keeping in mind so that those people who find themselves in embarrassing situations will certainly not be penalised in this true <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system that we have at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is wrong with that <span class="highlight">democratic</span> proposal? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only by imposing on the people the most undemocratic proposals, be they on voting hours, electoral procedures or postal voting, will electoral changes be implemented by honourable members opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In these proposals tonight we bring forward measures which we believe are designed to give the people of Australia a more <span class="highlight">democratic</span> electoral system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We categorise it for what it is- an endeavour to hold up the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process of this country and a classic example to the people of Australia of members of the Opposition who are too lazy to read a Bill and who voted against their own proposals because they did not know what to do on the issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill, the Urban and Regional (Financial Assistance) Bill 1974, is only a short Bill with some 1 1 clauses but it represents a milestone in the development of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system of 3-tier co-operative federalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a typical Country Party compromise where deals had to be done with the Liberals and the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing this perhaps the Government has passed on its philosophies and concepts to the Papua New Guinea Government which it has applied in developing its concepts and attitudes towards the role of a defence force in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would hardly believe that we are talking in a Westminster style <span class="highlight">democratic</span> parliament when one reads this section from the Minister’s second reading speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have imagined that that is the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process in line with the Australian Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How <span class="highlight">democratic</span> can one get? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are acting very democratically, I must say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then the doctors held their <span class="highlight">democratic</span> meeting from which they excluded anyone who did not agree with them, including me, and I am on the committee for the health centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with the honourable member in most of what he said but I think that all members, old and new, should be tied by the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles of the Parliament, and not just the old members of the Parliament who forced a double dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I come specifically to the proposition dealt with by the honourable member for Hotham, that in some way there will be some sort of dictatorial interference with the hospital and medical funds which are, to use his words, at present highly <span class="highlight">democratic</span> organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a message which went from the Department of the Northern Territory to Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They annihilated the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party senators who collaborated in this abuse of democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Meat Board does not cavil at it; in fact, it is a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> idea which is, I believe, welcomed by the Meat Board because it allows a larger number of people to have various types of expertise to be put forward and selected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see obstruction by the Senate not just in terms of the Bills which your Opposition Parties have defeated or emasculated but in the wider sense of deliberately interfering with the process of Government and threatening Australia’s <span class="highlight">democratic</span> future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a plague on the life cycle of Parliaments which will wreak havoc on our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To countenance another mid-term election, let alone to want to see it, is to place great strains on our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he and his Ministers spend their whole time conniving in these cynical, contemptuous and degrading, dirty tricks such as this exercise in this measure, it degrades the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They foolishly said that there ought to be free and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections in South Vietnam, and to this day they are still fighting over the meaning of the words. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labour Party in particular, but its supporters are no longer with us so we ought not to worry about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fortunate that there are many trade union officials today who welcome <span class="highlight">democratic</span> controls and processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-79-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposed legislation follows an examination of the methods adopted in other <span class="highlight">democratic</span> countries which have taken steps to reform their electoral procedures in these areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the wilful misuse of paragraph (b) could mean that the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elected rights of the people of the Northern Territory, in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, could see themselves without any responsibility to make laws for the order and good government of the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the clause could be redrawn in a form which would ask but not instruct the Legislative Assembly to reconsider the appropriateness of a Territory law in view of the Commission’s functions and activities and recommend that the Territory consider either repeal or amendment, so as to help the Commission but in no way impinging on the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights of the people of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We seek to preserve the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights of the citizens who will be affected by the operations of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the Government acknowledges the need for <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say unequivocally that my concern in Darwin, as primary as the responsibilities I have in regard to housing and reconstruction matters, is to ensure that <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rather than demagogic processes come to bear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third reading of the Bill could be postponed until these people had come to Canberra and, in an ordinary <span class="highlight">democratic</span> manner, had expressed their point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But decisions are made in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country and public opinion is moulded on the anvil of discussion and is the aggregate of composite opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A clear campaign  is  being mounted in this country in the State parliaments and in this Parliament to end <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government for ever in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make no mistake- the rule book has been torn up; the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system which we hold so dear to us, will be torn down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the double dissolution had not occurred the person appointed to fill  Senator Gair’s  vacancy in the Senate would have been a member of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the Austraiian Labor Party is not entirely a socialist party, but it does stand for policy reform or change based on a social, <span class="highlight">democratic</span> approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to suggest that only conservative politicians have good judgment we are saying that the nation is not entitled to <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government at all, in or outside of the courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is its right in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society so to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I for my part conclude where I began: This Bill represents a clear, savage and emphatic blow against the whole structure of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Steps have already been taken in various parts of the world to protect the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system from serious abuse in electoral funding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Scandals have rocked the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> world in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although that has not occurred in Australia, does anyone say that the Australian <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institution is stronger and better protected than was that of the United States prior to 1972? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Limitation of expenditure is good for the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is possible to spend sums of money in such proportions so as to deny totally the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Press is freely available to one political party and denied to another, as happens in some areas of Australia, if unlimited funds to purchase television time are available to one candidate and not available to another, a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> expression of the electorate is not possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But they will be of advantage to the electoral system and to the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This requirement is not something which does not exist anywhere else; it is a provision in almost every democratically elected Parliament with which we would like to compare ourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because I anticipated the tactics that would be employed, as is my right in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society, I took counter measures to ensure that money did not win Griffith for the Australian Labor Party and that people made their judgment on the qualities of the candidates and the policies of the parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the United States of America the trade union movement can in some years support the Republicans and in other years the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, I believe that as a citizen of Australia it is my right to give to the Australian Labor Party, the Australian Country Party, the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, the Australia Party, the Liberal Party of Australia and even the Communist Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party used them back in the mid-1960s when it showed Chinese soldiers marching across the Sydney Harbour Bridge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I would remind the honourable member for Bennelong that, rather than preceding the debacle called Watergate and all its attendant impact on <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections, the restrictions followed the abuses and were a direct result of those abuses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I say to the Australian people that this legislation represents a forward step in line with thinking in <span class="highlight">democratic</span> countries which seek to keep politics free of the implications and imputations which go with money power poured into party funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all else, we can take the great <span class="highlight">democratic</span> step forward in this country and keep in line with other great democracies which have realised how necessary this requirement is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether the Liberal Party still has a commitment to try to ensure the election of <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party senators to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding the fact that he was floored for the political full count by the honourable Joh Bjelke-Petersen in the recent Queensland State elections- I liked the remarks of the honourable member for Corio when he said that they were <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections, and I thank him for that admission and for the accuracy of his political comment and that he was defeated by a majority of 3.75 million votes to 3.5 million votes on 18 May last, on his own admission, on the self same referendum issues he now seeks to introduce the proposal again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In effect the people told him last May, at <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections, that they did not trust him, that there is to be a brake on him and that they want an overseer of the works he tries to carry out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pressure is being exerted on our present fundamental <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Riverina  (Mr Sullivan)  who by interjection said that to try to do away with the State’s House, which is the preserver of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights of the States and through the States the citizens who live in them, was a most despicable act of the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We submit that it is both unnecessary and unwanted and we ask the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  to accept the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> vote of the Australian people, who told him in no uncertain manner that they do not want a bar of this type of legislation and they will not stand his meddling in the affairs of substance in a way which interferes with their basic rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All we want to see is that those union members have a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right to say what their trade unions are going to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have yet to understand, let alone hear from the Minister, any good reason why the ordinary rules of democracy should not prevail in this situation, more particularly because so often we hear, and properly so, within the trade union movement in Australia the assertion that unionism is one of the most <span class="highlight">democratic</span> organisations within Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have some advantage in speaking on this matter because for a number of years I was a member of the Australian Labor Party at a time when it was a privilege to be a part of a party which was intensely Australian and whose loyalties were in the right position, adjusted to the betterment of this nation, to the quality of life of this nation but more particularly to <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles whereby individual members of that organisation had some say in matters affecting it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The motion is purely a political allegation that the Australian Labor Party is not a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say that we are the most <span class="highlight">democratic</span> of all institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It says that we believe in democracy, we believe in freedom of speech and we believe in the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institution of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We poll particularly well in getting <span class="highlight">democratic</span> support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us make it clear that if we want to give this Parliament some honesty and some credibility in the Australian way of life we should show it to be a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a very important part of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process that we do not have any governmental organisation which is dependent upon the taxpayers funds not being responsible to this Parliament as the representative of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, art not only must be represented by massive expenditure but also it should reflect essential, <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government policy through its expert bodies to give a lead in providing the Australian public with a stimulating variety of the performing and other arts suited to all tastes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we also want to ensure, secondly, a just and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> determination of the future of the people of East Timor, through a free act of self- determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Speaker, few people have done more to subvert the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes of this Parliament than has the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Yet this Prime Minister is the man who has the hide to go on national television and preach about the need to uphold tradition, and to protect the customs and conventions of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And when the attack and the destruction extend to the very heart of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institution- this Parliament-then it is time to stop the rot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The four of you did it by walking out of the chamber and refusing to have any part of the sordid plot the Prime Minister was leading- an act of treachery against the then  Speaker,  an act of treachery against this Parliament and an act of treachery against our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a matter of the gravest moment because it goes to the very heart of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true, as the Prime Minister keeps telling us, that democracy and the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institutions are under threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These things have been destroyed because this Government and this Prime Minister are too busy prattling about elections and conventions which they do not observe anyhow, strangling the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> parliamentary institution, manipulating Senate vacancies and piling up a lot of Socialist Bills in a double dissolution frenzy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Accordingly, I ask leave to have incorporated in Hansard, firstly, my letter of 13 March 1975 to  His Excellency  Nguyen Van Thieu, then  President  of the Republic of Vietnam; secondly, my letter of the same date to  His Excellency  Nguyen Duy Trinh, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Republic of Vietnam; thirdly, a cable dated 2 April from the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Australian Ambassador in Saigon,  Mr Price,  entitled ‘Vietnam Representations’; and, fourthly, a cablegram of the same date from the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Australian Ambassador in Hanoi,  Mr Wilson,  entitled ‘Vietnam Representations’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can assure the honourable member for Evans that in many progressive <span class="highlight">democratic</span> countries there is legislation providing for the disclosure of campaign funds notably, of course, Canada, the United States of America and certain European countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We come now to the next interesting document, a letter from the  Deputy  Prime Minister dated 13 February to  Mr Nien,  Charge d Affaires of the Embassy of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Republic of Vietnam …. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we are faced with is the problems that have occurred with the development of our legal system and the development of our parliamentary <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the reasons that I voted for your party in the last 2 Federal Elections was that the ALP policy seemed to offer some hope that environmental issues within the community would be resolved by <span class="highlight">democratic</span>- and ultimately by legalprocess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those organisations which have put their money into fighting the passage of this Bill have every <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right to fight against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government by this measure is ensuring the complete social destruction of Australians and making a mockery of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apparently an industry- its employees or its shareholdersprepared to stand up and protest about a Government program with which it disagrees is somehow engaged in a sinister plot to pervert the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The public should know that every electoral reform brought down by this Government, even for drawing for positions on the ballot paper, is looked upon as a sinister attack on the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> voting system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They could have asked themselves: Is this redistribution fair and equitable and in accordance with <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I tell the Liberal Party quite frankly that until it stands up for the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles which it put in its submissions to the Distribution Commissioners but which it runs away from in this House it can only expect to see the Liberal Party vote in Queensland declining in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This great <span class="highlight">democratic</span> National Country Party, or whatever it calls itself for the time being, had such a great interest in the matter that it said the redistribution was crook even before the Commissioners were appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was no supportive argument because his observations- selective and manipulative as they are- clash with the basic <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only support the proposal, having been requested to restore the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle and basic tenet of one vote one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would reflect discredit on the Opposition members in this House who would like to deliver a fatal body blow to one of the basic principles of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> parliamentary representation: one vote one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am glad to see that they have of late managed to shake off the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, but they are still very much subject to National Country Party pressure and most decisions that they make on issues and in regard to this redistribution have to fit in with National Country Party plans, sometimes to the embarrassment of the Liberal Party as we found during the last election when the Leader of the National Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  raised the issue of the price of petrol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Once the Government achieves a total stranglehold on the country, there is no way in the world that we will ever get back to sane and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Equality of political rights is inherent in a truly <span class="highlight">democratic</span> state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What an undemocratic, unfair, twisted attitude! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country in the world that I know of, except Australia, makes provision for the representation of remote regions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country except Australia provides for considerably smaller numbers of voters in large, scattered electorates than in tiny, compact city electorates- and that includes Britain, the mother of parliaments, where a tolerance of several hundred per cent is provided, Canada and the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the past few weeks, redistribution proposals based on this simple <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle have been laid before this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The time is overdue for change -a change to a more <span class="highlight">democratic</span> electoral system which would not disfranchise such a large number of voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is basic to our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see in this process of policy making the whole ethos of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government coming to a head. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Opposition backbenchers who see that man, the Leader of the Opposition, ready to knife the next rebel in the back are resentful of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suffice to say that we on this side of the House can well understand the chagrin of the National Country Party in regard to the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> decision of the Caucus to reaffirm the policy of the Government to set the floor price of wool at 250c a kilo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Recently, scientific representatives of the German <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Republic who visited us stated their amazement at the quality of these deposits, their quantity and the ease of their recovery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even that could not be spent in the first financial year because of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process we have to go through of acting through the States, local government, national trusts and other conservation groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange- to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features in those fields- in accordance with the principles of action, methods, and progressive reforms set out in this platform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senate <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> leader Mike Mansfield called for the immediate repeal of winter daylight saving and said that it had failed as an energy conservation measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The enrolments in these electorates- if I might make passing reference to them- are so malapportioned as to make the present basis of election undemocratic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are now exercising a delaying tactic to prevent <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections throughout the length and breadth of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were rejected by the Senate by the combined vote of the Australian Labor Party and the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the House again that the action of the Senate in rejecting the redistribution proposals for Queensland came about as a result of an initiative from the Labor Party, supported by the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And above all, it denies to the Australian people- Liberal voters every bit as much as Labor voters- the basic <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right of equal representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But today, the Prime Minister, faced with electoral disaster at the hands of a disillusioned and hurt electorate, came into this debate and threw away his belief in a fair and truly <span class="highlight">democratic</span> electoral system in a desperate effort to hang on in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not <span class="highlight">democratic</span> to have virtually equal numbers of voters in all electorates when electorates vary so much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has allowed the Country Party to do this and it allowed the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party to do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that they are forced to admit that in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> electoral system there must be some big electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a great surprise to me to see the members of the Opposition arguing for a situation which I believe is tending to denigrate the whole <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People both on the extreme right and on the extreme left in Australian politics would seem to be trying to drag down the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process and to make it as inefficient as possible for their own similar but at the same time disparate purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Party has always desired to cut out the influence of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now it has been presented to the Australian people as a free speech issue; but should terrorists who have attacked and slaughtered innocent civilians be granted the right of free speech, especially when their speech and their actions are aimed at the destruction of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> state which we sponsored and support? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then it had to square off the position with the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I, frankly, do not think much of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system when the Minister finds it necessary to make his own selection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have written to the Foreign Ministers of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Republic of Vietnam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam in these terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-75-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was always a very fair and impartial man and he ensured that the best <span class="highlight">democratic</span> traditions of the Australian Labor Party were upheld. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic charge is this: By his actions he has called into question the very integrity of Australia’s <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-93-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a conspiracy which has placed Australia’s economy and its international financial standing at serious risk, a conspiracy which has involved gross ministerial incompetence, the taint of scandal, and a conspiracy which has in the process threatened the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-129-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result is that there is now agreement that the events which led to the ministerial changes have been properly responded to, but I do not believe that the House can easily press on to other issues without fairly acknowledging the valuable and honourable role of the honourable member for Lalor to this institution over many years and his honourable and unyielding commitment to the issues of personal rights, civil liberties and the freedoms of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-139-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, voting for the Legislative Council was under restrictive franchise and most undemocratic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the optional preferential system of voting is one of the most <span class="highlight">democratic</span> advances which this country can endorse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should follow the example of South Australians, introduce an optional preferential system in accordance with what has been presented to the Australian Parliament by the present Government, and in that way we would get the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> results that have come on this occasion to the South Australian Upper House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless I simply point out at the beginning that the right of one to make a donation is a part of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party used to show Chinese soldiers marching across the Sydney Harbour Bridge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without a doubt it has always been the Country Party tail- I am not quite sure what that Party now calls itself; I think the latest is the National Country Party which is a consortium of the Country Party and the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party- that has wagged the dog. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could go back to 1962 when we warned the LiberalCountry Party Government as it was thenbefore the Country Party changed its name to the National Country Party and amalgamated with the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party- that unless it took action on this issue it would get the same reactions as were occurring in Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I finalise on this point, and I think the honourable member for Cowper and his friends in the consortium of the Country Party and the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party now called the National Country Party should take note of it: In 1958 the Labor Opposition started warning the then government of the effects of its policies of deliberately encouraging the takeover of Australian industry by overseas interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was glad to hear the honourable member for Mitchell  (Mr Cadman)  point out that under a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system any person who occupies the position of Minister for Defence has an authority from the elected representatives of the people through this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Kennedy seemed to think that just because he did not happen to be the Minister for Defence, any powers given to the Minister were completely undemocratic or completely against the Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly there is no law of which I am aware which dictates that any person or any citizen living in this land should be prevented from enjoying to the full his <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Hawke,  the  President  of the Australian Labor Party and  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, along with union delegates from other <span class="highlight">democratic</span> countries, moved an amendment requiring that all those seeking admission to the ILO should agree to abide by the rules and principles of the ILO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the information that I had acquired about the process of getting oil from coal, I made a private trip overseas to West Germany and to the German <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Republic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without authority I proposed to the Minister of Science and Technology and to the Foreign Minister in the German <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Republic that it might be possible to form a consortium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is being considered by the German <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Republic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The German <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Republic is anxious to be a successful tenderer for the provision of the equipment and technical know-how. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The keenness of the Ministers of the German <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Republic to trade was kindled, but it was equally matched by <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The national organisations of the Australia Party, the National Country Party, the Liberal Party of Australia and the Australian Labor Party, and one State executive of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, have worked closely with the conference organisers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true that at the last election in Portugal the people showed at the ballot box that they wanted a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialist government, such as there is in Scandinavia, Western Germany, the Netherlands, Britain, New Zealand and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Throughout the period leading up to the events which have followed the show of force by the Timorese <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Union on 10 August the Government has been very much aware of the difficulties which were likely to accompany the decolonisation process in Portuguese Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We present this measure- an eminently <span class="highlight">democratic</span> and nonpartisan reform- as a single Bill in the hope that the issue will not be clouded by irrelevant argument but will be dealt with by this Parliament responsibly recognising the merits of the system from the public and electoral points of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>2) 1975, this is a non-partisan reform which is designed to introduce a system of voting which provides for the maximum flexibility and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> freedom of choice for the voters while maintaining the essential elements of a full preferential system, should the voters choose to indicate preferences for all candidates in the election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The 1974 Senate elections in New South Wales, when there were 73 candidates, and to a lesser extent the 1 974 Senate elections in certain other States, gave a clear indication of what might happen in the future unless a sufficient deterrent is introduced to operate against frivolous candidature or candidature designed to infringe upon, or obstruct, the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process of election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 5 main provisions to which I have referred, together with the minor amendments previously supported by the Opposition, will lead to improved voting facilities for electors, will remedy defects in our electoral practices, and create a more <span class="highlight">democratic</span> and efficient electoral system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The preservation of the security of Australia as a free and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> nation and the welfare of the Australian people, promoted through a sound economic policy with justice to all sections, are the paramount responsibilities of this national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Would the Minister undertake to say to them that they must not talk about East Timor, that they must not have an attitude to the UDT- the Timor <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Union- and Fretilin or in regard to self-determination of East Timor, its incorporation into Indonesia or its remaining a colony of Portugal? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It also welcomes statements such as those by the Prime Minister of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Republic of Vietnam,  Mr Pham  Van Dong, at the opening of the Fifth National Assembly in Hanoi in June 1975, that North Vietnam too seeks friendship and co-operation with other countries in South-East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-18">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Ultimately we may see at a vital time in the Senate a majority changed by votes brought about by the actions of the Leader of the National Country Party in this place and the Leader of the National Country Party in Queensland, and a docile Liberal Party leadership which will not stand up and be counted on a great moral and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> issue such as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is simply the modern method of debasing the currency in order to give to the ruler, be he a monarch or be it a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government, more of the people ‘s wealth and income to finance the ruler’s expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The view that industrial agreements should be the only legal agreements which are binding on one party and not the other is contrary to our philosophy, contrary to law and contrary to the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This situation has presented no problem to this stage because the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party could always be relied upon to support the Government parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us have a look at the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process by which the members of these Parliaments are elected in their totality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The point to which I was coming is that because a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system does not operate in New South Wales we now have sitting in the other chamber of this Parliament a person who does not reflect the result of the voting pattern expressed by the people of New South Wales at the last Senate election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With those 2 other tiers of government in this country the Federal Parliament can make an important contribution to the continuing progress of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> form of Government in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every member of this House should give very serious consideration to something which is of vital importance to our country and to future generations- the maintaining of our system and of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable members on both sides of the chamber know that in only a very few countries in Europe does the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> parliamentary tradition have a very firm basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that a lot of what goes on here is tedious and boring, but that is part of the substance of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not my understanding of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition and the Opposition generally are deliberately trying to destroy the trust which should exist between the Public Service, the Parliament and the elected government; in other words, the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No nation can be really great and really <span class="highlight">democratic</span> and take its place in the world as an enlightened community if it has within its borders substantial numbers of people who are living in depressed circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to conceal our national shame by pointing out that earlier when there was a Labor Federal government- a National <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Party Government as they would know it- in the late 1940s, it was able to secure free hospitalisation throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another election in this year- that is 3 elections in less than 3 years- would be an outrageous misuse of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> privileges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This transgression of the traditional <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process has taken place in many areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government wants its program the people of Australia will agree provided the legal process is observed and the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process is carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We argued that all those things they hated could be corrected through the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The admission which has just been made demonstrates that there is no suggestion of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> reason for the suspension of Standing Orders but specifically an intention to change the legislation to the electoral advantage of the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Liberal-Country Party of the day in a petulant reaction to the then Opposition, the Labor Party, and the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party defeating its proposals in the Senate run off and bring the proposals back in the form of legislation and hold a double dissolution threat over the then Opposition? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every time the Opposition criticises legislation or responsibly uses its majority in another place it is accused of obstructionism and of frustrating the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> will of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What perhaps some members of the House may not know is that if the proposals submitted to the Distribution Commissioners by the Australian Labor Party in New South Wales- this Party which is so committed to <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government, which is so committed to one vote one value, which is so committed to electoral justice- were accepted by the Commissioners they would, on the same votes cast in May 1 974, give to the Labor Party in New South Wales 29 seats and not 25 seats and would give to the joint Opposition Parties 16 seats and not 20 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government flies in the face of principles which are accepted in virtually every <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country of which I know makes allowances for the special difficulties of providing adequate representation in large, remote, sparsely settled electorates because they know that it is the fair, just and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> thing to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It certainly has no real respect for the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights of the Australian people, especially those who live outside the great cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister is no more interested in achieving equality of representation than he is in maintaining a fair and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> voting system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, because the Senate has a system of proportional representation- a system which the honourable member for Port Adelaide knows very well- the result is always likely to be close and one which is very <span class="highlight">democratic</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the honourable member for Port Adelaide said, they have torn up the rule book, conventions and the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What a remarkable coincidence under a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> voting system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They could have asked themselves: is this redistribution fair and equitable and in accordance with <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>If one believes that the Constitution should be changed, that for instance education should be directed by the Commonwealth, there is machinery by way of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> referendum of the people to change the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point I was trying to make last night is that we were able to convince the great majority of people who took to the streets that the answer was to work through the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1974, when the Opposition decided to try to cut short our elected term of office by half, those people were boiling with anger but once again they gave the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process a go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be our worry but it will also be your worry because there will be no way in the world they will listen to us when we say: ‘Work through the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process is wrecked once and for all- that is what the Opposition is bringing down upon Australia- it will give the people no other alternative but to take to the streets and to violence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not only the social <span class="highlight">democratic</span> governments, such as that in Australia, which have it, but it is also governments comprised of parties which would be comparable to those parties sitting opposite which have it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, social <span class="highlight">democratic</span> governments in general, as in Germany, have been able to keep unemployment lower and conservative governments, such as the United States or others in Western Europe, have higher unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Jess Committee, which was established under the Gorton Government, comprised members of the Senate and this House who were members of all political parties, including the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party which was represented in the Senate at the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  style of operation is unworthy of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span>, decent way of life that is expected of politicians in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, of course, he links up with the National Party Queensland Premier, who in recent times has used his influence on the Leader of the Opposition and who by his very actions in the appointment of a senator to replace my late colleague,  Senator Bert  Milliner, seeks to destroy our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system of parliamentary elections whereby the people can determine the party that will govern them for a period of 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you start white-anting away at the foundations, as the Opposition has been doing since 1972- whiteanting the foundations of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> systemit is a hop, step and jump before the system crumbles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system at any time hangs by a very fragile thread. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, if such an action is taken, it will set an extraordinary precedent- a precedent that will destroy <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I tell honourable members opposite that the Australian Labor Party is the one <span class="highlight">democratic</span> party in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many former members of the (a) Liberal, (b) National Country Party or (c) <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party were appointed to an office of profit by the Australian Government between 1949 and 2 December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-35-10">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Labor’s stated objective is to change Australia from a capitalist, free enterprise, <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society to a socialist state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we consider that this unique and tremendous power is in the hands of 3 main groups in this country it becomes more and more obvious that a Department of the Media dedicated to encouraging the communication and dissemination of a wide variety of opinions is essential to our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not seek to inhibit the right of people to express their views, whether in newspapers, on radio or on television, no matter how unconventional, no matter how undemocratic, no matter how much they oppose or offend our established beliefs and customs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we do not have enough faith in the good commonsense of our people, if we are not firmly enough convinced that our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way of life can withstand attacks from the more extremist positions, then we are standing on extremely shaky ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Councils should see the regional concept for its real <span class="highlight">democratic</span> value- an opportunity for local government to make its own decisions on a local level, an opportunity to solve local problems- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as there is any power associated with them, it is responsible power for which they are accountable in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> accountability of power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the section which provides the system whereby subject to laws of this sort being passed by the Parliament or in the event of those laws in some circumstances not even being passed by the Senate a proposal can be put to the people by way of referendum and that is therefore <span class="highlight">democratic</span> action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose it is part of their <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right to vote in such a manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite any subsequent speakers from the Government side in this debate to challenge that approach as being other than a reasonable approach to a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system of election in a single member constituency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That may be a desirable political objective but it is not necessarily consonant with a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> voting system to reduce the influence of minority parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should we not have in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society an ability for a party to grow from a small nucleus to perhaps something really worthwhile? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly advantages the Labor, Liberal and National Country Parties, but it does not advantage the Australia Party, the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party or a whole host of other smaller parties which believe that they should have a right to contest certain electorates to try to push forward views that they think are necessary to better society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>infamous days of the late 1950s and 1960s the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party of Australia, when it was contesting elections, went out of its way at both Federal and State elections to have on ballot papers the names of people whose names began with either A, B or C. In a Federal election that lifted the Party’s percentage of the national vote to such an extent that it thought it was a decent, acceptable and some sort of major political party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  Party, of course, has been even worse than the Liberal Party in promoting breaches of parliamentary and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> conventions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The many amendments to these Bills- particularly to this Bill- seek to assist in the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> procedure of conducting elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The obvious proposal which comes from the honourable member is that the more voting is facilitated, the more people are able to vote, the easier it becomes to cast a vote, the fewer informal votes there are, the more this will assist the Government That may well be true, but it is also true that to facilitate the expression of opinion by electors is basic to the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is just as logical for me to say that what he is putting forward is that he is seeking to make it harder, that he is seeking to subvert the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process, that he does not really want an expression of majority rule, that he wants a manipulated result whereby the Opposition parties can scramble back into government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do this because yesterday in the Senate, because of a political decision against all precedent and principle, <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government in Australia has been threatened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House of Representatives is not only the national chamber; it is the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> chamber; it is the grand depository and embodiment of the liberal principles of government which pervade the entire constitutional fabric. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now the Leader of the Opposition shows that he is prepared to rock and perhaps even threaten the very foundation of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system in pursuit of his ambition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a democracy we rely on the fact that the people who elect members to Parliament expect their members to honour the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rules of a constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite would not expect us, as a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government, to say: ‘We will have an election for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The election will be a contest between foreign dollars and Australian votes, the votes of men and women who want to keep Australia Australian and who want parliamentary democracy to remain <span class="highlight">democratic</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It begins with the proposition that the Office, employing solicitors and bringing into being a solicitor and client relationship between the solicitor or the lawyer employed in the Office and client, with complete independence, should at the same time, consistent with proper <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles, I would have thought, be accountable ultimately to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would prostitute the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes by rejection of the Appropriation Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these attempts to bypass decency, tradition, fair play and convention are nothing less than prostitution of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reduction of an ultimate constitutional sanction- if indeed it should ever be used at all- to the level of a routine political tactic is a debasing of our constitutional system and the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> values it is supposed to protect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable members on this side of the House recognise that the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system under which we live is precious. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House will be aware of the report cited in the Jakarta newspaper  Kompas  of 20 October that advancing <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Union of Timor- UDT- and Apodeti forces had come across the remains of 4 male Europeans in the Balibo area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People came from political parties right across the board- the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party and the Communist Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very simply, it is a struggle to protect our Australian way of life, to protect our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> parliamentary system and to maintain stability in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once we start whiteanting away at the foundations of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system, as the Opposition has been doing since 1972, it is one hop, step and a jump before the system collapses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system at any time hangs by a very fragile thread. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate,  Senator Withers,  constantly bleats that the Senate is a democratically elected House and that it has certain powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mere act of casting a vote does not necessarily make the Senate a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> House, and it is not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I reject that proposition not only as a supporter of the present Ministry but also as a supporter of the Parliament, a <span class="highlight">democratic</span>, responsible Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He fights to perpetuate not a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system, for he has contemptuously ground it under foot when ever it suited him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the same way in which Queensland, which got its separation and independence in 1859, had a more <span class="highlight">democratic</span> constitution than New South Wales, which attained its constitution in 1852, so it was that the Australian Constitution does not precisely enshrine the principle of the exclusive responsibility of the Lower House in the way in which that principle subsequently developed in Great Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That proposition would have to commend itself at any time, given the contrast between the nature of the House of Representatives on the one side as the House of the people- the House where the Government is formed, the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> House- and the Senate on the other side, being the acknowledged undemocratic House within the Australian parliamentary system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It could have indicated that he was an Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party candidate on 2 occasions, that he stood against endorsed ALP candidates, that he is a millionaire and that he made money during the service station boom in the 1950s from getting franchises for land through oil companiesthe same sorts of interests as the Leader of the National Country Party represents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The next thing I mentioned was that he had been a <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party candidate on a number of occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Would that he were more responsible, less ambitious and not indifferent to the great strains and stresses which he has suddenly and selfishly cast upon our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institutions of parliamentary government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is absurd to suggest that the Senate is as <span class="highlight">democratic</span> as is this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Every responsible, commonsense member, whether he be a Government member or an Opposition member, knows that violence to settle political disputes in this country is abhorrent to any party that believes in <span class="highlight">democratic</span> practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe it is not just a question of survival of this Government; it is a question of survival of our whole <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whether it is a communist country or a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialist country like our own, like all the Scandinavian countries, like the Federal Republic of Germany, like Austria where Chancellor Kreisky has just been re-elected: or whether it is a country with a conservative government, like France or Italy, this same problem of inflation- a world problem- has affected them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One big area in which there is a difference between the conservative governments in the countries which I visited and the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialist governments in the countries which I visited is in the protection of the needy people from the effects of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>On each occasion that the Prime Minister makes the assertion that the Senate lacks the power to defer a money Bill he demonstrates completely his failure to understand the rights and privileges of people in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One thing is perfectly clear: Like the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, the Country Party is on the way out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As we have a federal system, regardless of how we would draw up the Constitution if we were drawing it afresh today, it is important that we recognise that it is a system with its own checks and balances, a system which with goodwill can work, a system in which the ultimate control is that of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> constituents, who can determine from their own assessment of how money is spent and how money is raised how the government of the day- local, State or Federal- is carrying out its responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his obsession to cling to power at all costs, the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  is willing to defy all constitutional processes, to wreck <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institutions and deliberately to inflict unnecessary hardship on the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, it will destroy the bulwark that stands against betrayal of the electorate and will destroy the vital <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle that government can be held accountable to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the events of 1 1 November- momentous for the Parliament, for  the strength and vitality of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institutions, for Australia’s reputation in the worldthe honourable member for Corio emerged as a true and valiant defender of the rights of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have always respected certain journalists, and I wish to pay a tribute to  Mr Cranston,  a forthright journalist, and I wish to pay a tribute to the  Canberra Times  and to a man named Cavanough for disclosing something that attacks the very roots of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system, and that is graft in politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is regrettable to see, I believe, and bad for the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institution that there is a tendency for the talent of the Party opposite to be represented continually in swinging seats so that when the judgment of the people goes against not necessarily the policy of those men in swinging seats but against the policies of the tired war horses who remain we see, I am afraid, a decimation of talent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That little speech was made only 9 months after the 1969 elections, and if the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, which was then represented in the Senate, had decided to combine forces with the Australian Labor Party Opposition that year and throw out the Budget, in  Mr Whitlam  ‘s own words, the Government of that day would have had no alternative but to face the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not know much about the internal workings of the offices of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union but I think it would take a high degree of charity to regard them as anything like the implementation of a proper system of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Opposition might well be thankful that his dismissal and overwhelming rejection by the Australian population gave him the time and the frame of mind perhaps to embroider the myth of a social <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government brought to an untimely end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The net result of this maniacal Press exercise of power was the dismissal of the democratically elected Labor Government by the Governor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question I pose is this: Is it really a true exercise of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process when the Press and the media of this country can exercise so much power over the thoughts and actions of people, that the people become as mere putty in the hands of three or four Press barons? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Provided that we do not lose courage in ourselves and the things we have fought for for so long, and provided that we can continue to have faith in our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institutions, we shall realise the ideals in which the Liberal Party has always and will always put its trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is a serious error on the part of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> governments to allow the forces of public information to remain under monopoly control in the highly centralised situation such as we find in Australia at the present moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A government with the slightest respect for free institutions and the rights of members of the Parliament, a government with an ounce of sensitivity to the public’s anxiety on this matter, would at least feel obliged to explain and justify this gross departure from <span class="highlight">democratic</span> practice, this gross abuse of the law enforcement agencies of the Crown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In certain circumstances there is much to commend the universal provision of such welfare benefits; it is in accord, in my opinion, with the best interests of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The quality of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process is enhanced to the degree that decisions are based on proper examination of the issues, to the extent that those affected by governmental decisions can be consulted and have a chance to be heard before decisions are taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is a duty that used to be regarded as fundamental to responsible <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although we share common interests- we are both rich, industrialised, <span class="highlight">democratic</span> and relatively, in the case of Australia, underdeveloped- we will have our disagreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can say that both in the Liberal <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Party Government of Japan and in this Government there is a weighty rural voice which will, to a certain extent, modify and change the policies and the attitudes of the Governments to each other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No government today can regard the future with equanimity- certainly no parliament of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country such as Australia, with its enormous potential to give not only to its own people but also to the world and especially to South East Asia the area which is of such vital importance to the future of our own nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such public discussion of government policies is welcome to this Government, both as a contribution to the solution of national problems, and as a means of revitalising the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes which are so important to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Liberal Party platform sets out quite clearly that freedom of expression in the Press, radio and television and freedom from governmental and political interference are fundamental to Liberal beliefs and essential to <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, inherent in the whole of the Governor-General’s Speech is the danger that the vile and anti-<span class="highlight">democratic</span> occurrences of November 1975 could be repeated at any time in the future should the situation that existed in the Senate at that time exist again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely, if nearly 50 per cent of the people in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country are not only hopeful but also adamant that another constitutional crisis will not occur, then it is reasonable that a government should acknowledge and dispel such fears. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The sometimes insidious, sometimes blatant anti-<span class="highlight">democratic</span> actions of the Labor Government over 3 years should be of great concern to all Australians and must never be forgotten. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My information is that although there is some communist infiltration into Fretilin it is, basically, a strong nationalistic movement comprising people who are determined to gain their independence in an ordinary <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I find it very sad that an elected member of this House, representing the independent <span class="highlight">democratic</span> people of Australia, should deny that same independence, that some <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right, to our neighbours in Portuguese East Timor, which is only 300 miles from Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system of this country has reached a very low level if people can be appointed to the Senate by State governments and then have the power to block the supply of finance approved by this House of Representatives a House in which each member is elected by the wishes and the votes of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s programs will continue to improve and to provide for the people of this nation, particularly the people of New South Wales, a better way of life, a way of life that they themselves can control, a way of life that will not be directed from Canberra, a way of life that will allow them to exercise their freedom and the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right that all thinking people value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I also pledge myself to actively support and advocate at all times the Party’s objective- the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features in these fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They certainly should not rely solely on the ballot box every 3 years if they want to have a proper, <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a rather comforting <span class="highlight">democratic</span> theory that Parliament has the power to control the public purse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe in the long run there has to be more scrutiny by Parliament as such of policy if its <span class="highlight">democratic</span> theory of control of the public purse is to have any meaning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The quality of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process is enhanced to the degree that decisions are based on proper examination of the issues, to the extent that those affected by governmental decisions can be consulted and have a chance to be heard before decisions are taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the main they were unions that confidently predicted that they would be able to get from this Government the right to continue with an anti-<span class="highlight">democratic</span> control of their unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I pay tribute to the very fine work carried out by  Mr Joe  Riordan in opposing this insidious attempt by NCC agents to persuade  Senator James  McClelland to defy Labor Party policy and the platform of the Australian Labor Party to bring in this anti-<span class="highlight">democratic</span> system of controlling union officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But, of course, by the same rule it will lose votes for the Government now that those who voted for it in the belief that they were going to get the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> direct voice of the rank and file know that they are going to get only an indirect voice and that handfuls of men calling themselves the management committees of unions will elect each other to the most important full time positions at the federal level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my view, this would not cut across our policy proposals in relation to <span class="highlight">democratic</span> control and supervised ballots and would be in accordance with the policy in connection with fundamental changes to the rules of an organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nothing that the Government says again at an election will ever be believed by those people who on this occasion were silly enough to believe that when the Government said it believed in <span class="highlight">democratic</span> control of trade unions it did believe in it, because the reintroduction of the collegiate system proves beyond all doubt that it does not believe in union democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In August 1969 the then Liberal Minister for External Affairs  Mr Freeth,  candidly acknowledged the realities of Soviet naval power and was vilified by his colleagues and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party for his pains. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would hope that as a result of my mentioning this in the House today it may be drawn to the attention of the appropriate Ministers to see whether they can persuade the Cabinet that if a point is important enough to lead to banning- which should be the very last step in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society- then there must be some intermediate or additional point where rational arguments are used to try to prevent people from doing certain things which are considered to be wrong either in their own interests or in the interests of the society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For a long time our sorts of societies, that is, Western <span class="highlight">democratic</span> societies, have accepted the principle that those services that are seen as a necessity- services that in short we recognise as social services, such as unemployment and sickness benefits, social welfare payments of all sorts and so on- are not paid for by imposing a fiat rate tax on everybody in the same way as the contributions to the voluntary funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Each of these 3 legacies I have mentioned of Australian rule- a sound administration, the maintenance of law and order through civil courts and the civil police, and a workable, <span class="highlight">democratic</span> Parliament- will, with our continued support of Papua New Guinea, help guarantee her stability and that of the surrounding region until well into the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The shallow contribution we have just heard from the honourable member for Swan  (Mr Martyr),  the former secretary of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party in Western Australia, who now sits in this place as a Liberal, a self-appointed extremistalthough I must confess that I think there are many sitting around him who are in the same camp- with his emphasis on force, on blood and iron I think was one of the expressions he used, changes nothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the situation should emerge in the future that the majority of Australians want the powers of his office clarified, reduced or even increased, let it be decided by the correct <span class="highlight">democratic</span> means- that is, informed debate and consequent referenda proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is very interesting to note that there is greater equality of income distribution in Australia than there is in most of the communist countries in Eastern Europe, and they are countries where there have been great sacrifices of individual liberties in pursuit of an egalitarianism which cannot be matched by that achieved in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system such as our own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The bases of this Government’s policies are our rejection of the use of force as a proper means of solving international problems; our belief in the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process and the rights of people to determine their own institutions; and our deep concern for the welfare of the underprivileged anywhere in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is, of course, a very real tendency for the ruling classes in many of these countries, regardless of whether they be there by the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process or by force of arms, to take the view that having achieved power, the object of the exercise is to maintain it regardless of how the people under them are expected to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It does so because it believes that they run counter to the effective and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> operation and control of organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe,  Mr Atwell,  that we were opposed to Labor in any of its forms, be it <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor, Socialist Labor or communist cum Labor and if I am wrong in my acceptance of this belief would you please inform me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our opinion, it does not accord in any way with the principle of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> control of unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What this Government is doing now is reversing that legislation and allowing the undemocratic appointment procedure to be continued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a contrast this creates with the Government’s assertions during last year’s election campaign that it would provide for the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> control of unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government’s action in moving to retain that system makes a mockery of its high sounding rhetoric about its determination to ensure <span class="highlight">democratic</span> control of unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this Bill, as framed by the Minister, does provide that framework within which the rank and file worker can exercise his <span class="highlight">democratic</span> vote, where he can control his union and where the small States and workers from the small States are given an adequate representation without being dominated by the bulk of membership from the larger States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That union -certainly in Victoria and I believe also federally- is not the most <span class="highlight">democratic</span> organisation in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All members of the Parliament are, I am sure, committed to <span class="highlight">democratic</span> control of trade unions and employer organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cornerstone of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> control is membership participation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is, however, that direct election is not, in all situations, a guarantee of proper <span class="highlight">democratic</span> control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The contents of this Bill revolve purely and simply around the whole question of whether there is to be <span class="highlight">democratic</span> election of people in trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make the point that no one system of union elections, whether it be by direct ballot of all members or by a collegiate system, in itself guarantees <span class="highlight">democratic</span> control of that union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A collegiate system with adequate safeguards contained in it would allow such unions to have a more <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system of election of union officials than would a direct system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for St George made great play about the collegiate system being very <span class="highlight">democratic</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That whereas the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> control of organisations registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is essential to a sound system of industrial relations; and whereas <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> control can only be guaranteed by the opportunity for all rank and file members of organisations to vote in elections for all officials and all Committees of Management and whereas some forces within the Trade Union movement are attempting to deny rank and file members the right to vote in all Union elections;- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He left the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party 6 months before the last election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The political position of those 2 trade union secretaries is closer to the Liberal and National Country Parties and the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party than it is to the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There cannot be a more sensible and more <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system for those trade unions which prefer that method of operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite plain to us on this side of the House what is necessary to guarantee a proper, <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system in the trade union movement, and that is what we have done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was perpetrated by members of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, a former member of which now sits on the Government benches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is as <span class="highlight">democratic</span> a process as one will see. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, it gives me great pleasure, having spoken the week before last in support of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Party candidate for the American presidency, to say that it appears at this stage that - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the key global elements of that agenda, using the terminology of the Carter team- do not ask me to spell it all out extensively in the time available for questions without notice, or in any order of priorityare, firstly, a cooler hard-headed approach to the Soviet Union; secondly, a stress on reducing the proliferation of nuclear weapons; thirdly, the building up of core alliances with <span class="highlight">democratic</span> countries, which  Mr Carter  describes as a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> concert and in which he includes quite specifically, Australia; fourthly, greater stress, to use his terminology, on global issues, and in particular the north-south dialogue; and finally, and this is by no means unimportant, the belief that there is a need to get a firm domestic base for his foreign policies by making these policies reflect, as he puts it, the moral values of the American people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as Australia is concerned, both the stress on the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> concert and the stress on the global problems are important and are likely to give us salients in our discussions with the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe I am correct in saying that all political parties represented in this House would agree that diversity of opinion is an essential prerequisite of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable member for Blaxland  (Mr Keating)  subscribes to the principle of freedom of speech, why is he bringing forward a Bill designed to exclude certain sections and interest groups in the community from their <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right to have access to one particular form of media outlet? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite would socialise with their unification the human and the physical resources of this country because they believe it is the trendy <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialist thing to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But not even the great German <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialist, Willie Brandt, for whom the Leader of the Opposition has such great respect, supports this outdated and inept view of centralism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ALP would be better advised to follow the role that its trendy <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialist trendy friends in Germany have adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our friend, the former State secretary of the Austraiian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party up until 3 years ago ought to know about the DLP in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The way to end the argument is not the traditional <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party way of saying that people should not have the right to speak. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues behind him that the Liberal Party platform sets out quite clearly that freedom of expression in the Press, radio and television and freedom from governmental and political interference are fundamental to Liberal beliefs and essential to <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We therefore recommend that no decision be taken in relation to the foregoing matters until a reasonable time has elapsed and there has been an opportunity for the usual <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes to function, including, in this respect, parliamentary debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He would have tried to force a double dissolution if he had been able to obtain concurrence in his proposed action from the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a serious situation, and I believe that to an extent the seriousness is compounded by the fact that this kind of action, selectively directed against the media, can impose a kind of censorship in Australia which is utterly alien to our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system of government and it ought not to be tolerated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if I speak on Grievance Day it is not because we grieve for the Labor Government or grieve for ourselves, but because we grieve for the hopes of millions of Australians who supported us, millions who believed that the system of government we profess to uphold offered them some hope, some fair chance of participation in the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We grieve for the damage done to the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system and for the lost faith of those who believed in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that the Labor Government on 1 1 November was not without Supply; the second is that whatever the force of convention in these matters, the view that the Senate is a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> House comparable with the House of Representatives can never be sustained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will continue until we return to honesty and decency in government; until the rules of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system are restored and upheld; until the Australian people reelect a government that stands once again for progress, humanity and justice, a Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me make it very clear that from the point of view of democracy the Whitlam Government was denied its <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right to remain in office for 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not have to argue whether it would be better or not; I merely say that on <span class="highlight">democratic</span> grounds in May 1967 in the one referendum in the whole history of this country which one could say was really carried, because it was carried in every polling place, the Australian people expressed the opinion that the national Parliament was the proper Parliament to handle Aboriginal affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Given the complexity of modern <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government, and the comparatively short term which Commonwealth governments are allowed between elections, it is crucial that there should be more orderly and effective scheduling of Government business through the various stages of research, objective setting and policy formulation, program design and the evaluation of program effectiveness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, of course, in 1956, at the appropriate time- I point out that I know that branch very well; I lived only 4 miles from it and therefore I know its history- that branch split and joined the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Carter’s appointment of his Cabinet has been criticised by some but it does appear to be a significant attempt to draw together the full coalition of interests within the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society no one should, in our view, be able to hold power indefinitely without being subject to automatic re-appraisal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is that this Bill strikes at a basic <span class="highlight">democratic</span> aspect of our government and our Parliament in the handing over of power from the Parliament to public servants- at the handing over of power from elected people, people who are subject to recall, to people who are appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Coombs arrangements would have been much more desirable and much more <span class="highlight">democratic</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, and unhappily- I think unhappily for good <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government- we have allowed the position to become a total authority, particularly on the other side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country such as ours where voting is compulsory everybody is political. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is involved is a basic <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Chifley, from the fancies of his mind, claimed that I had been a member of the Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>None of the Bills deals with the structure of State legislatures, although in respect to <span class="highlight">democratic</span> safeguards their constitutions except possibly South Australia and in one respect- terms of office- N.S.W. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a necessary part of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1974 the Australian Labor Party Government submitted that question along with 3 others- the mode of altering the Constitution to which I referred a moment ago, <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections and local government questionsto the people at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appeal to all voting Australians to support this move to see that their fellow citizens in the Territories are given the right to vote in referenda so that they can exercise the same <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights as all other voting citizens and express their points of view of issues which concern them as much as they concern other citizens of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in the case of a Labor Party senator changing his Party affiliations, as did many Labor Party members in previous years who joined other parties such as the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party, we would be courting a dangerous situation if we had to ensure that a casual vacancy was filled by a person of the Party to which the departing senator belonged at the time of the election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We live under the most undemocratic constitutional document probably in existence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that our Constitution is the most undemocratic constitutional document. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite honourable members opposite to go to the Library and find some other person anywhere in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society who has that authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party’s formidable campaign defeated the referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trade unions are <span class="highlight">democratic</span> organisations, not like the political party to which the honourable member belongs and not like the other functions with which he associates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is going to take that right away from people- the Government is making a very strong attack on that in this Bill- it will strike at the very basis of a free and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Burke  (Mr Keith Johnson)  talked at great length about the trade unions being <span class="highlight">democratic</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely, with a complex Bill such as this, that is the least we should expect under a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are magnitudes of power and minitudes of power and some difficulties in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process also requires that the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those sorts of things are proper compensation, but no single member can get up here and argue that that is a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That sort of situation in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country such as Australia should not be tolerated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basis of this electoral legislation is the heart of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be effective and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> only if it ensures a fair, open and representative system which translates the genuine wishes of electors into parliamentary voices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Right here and now, I state clearly that the amendments proposed in this Bill are such that the process will be <span class="highlight">democratic</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is necessary to remind honourable members opposite of the meaning of the word ‘<span class="highlight">democratic</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely this legislation which has been brought forth is in fact <span class="highlight">democratic</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I can say to that is that our system is <span class="highlight">democratic</span> and, in this Jubilee year, might I say that I hope it will endure as a system of consititutional monarchy for a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it will survive only if we maintain and enhance its <span class="highlight">democratic</span> values at a time when <span class="highlight">democratic</span> values and the things which accompany them such as human rights and civil liberties are disappearing extremely quickly around the globe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From memory, only about 25 of the 140-odd individual independent nations of the world are exceptionally <span class="highlight">democratic</span> with independent parliaments and with judiciaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 115 or so regimes which need a strong <span class="highlight">democratic</span> example such as we have in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill helps to give to this country a strong <span class="highlight">democratic</span> representation in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought to be one of the simplest things in the world to draw up a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process that is acceptable to all the people on both sides of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happens if there should be an autocratic, authoritarian government which decides that it will lose the next election, whips through a redistribution and stops what we call the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been done in Western Australia, Victoria and most of the other States barring Tasmania, which has the one truly <span class="highlight">democratic</span> State Legislative Assembly because it has a proportional representation system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I ask in this <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country is that if a party obtains the majority vote, it be in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It first went to the people and some <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party and independent senators conducted a quite dishonest campaign amongst the people of Australia, saying that the Government was trying to increase the numbers of members of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not the least of the kind remarks he made was the comment that Tasmania is a truly <span class="highlight">democratic</span> State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in the spirit, not only of being a Liberal but also as one who believes in the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process, that I congratulate the Government on the introduction of these electoral measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are, in my submission, good legislation, fair legislation and, above all, <span class="highlight">democratic</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I hope that men of goodwill on both sides of this House will have come to the conclusion that the sorts of amendment proposals which are now before the chamber are fair and appropriate in the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> parliamentary system that we have in this country in 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sooner we can get electoral redistribution away from the political scene and out of the hands of politicians so that the public will see that it is not being done for the purpose of gerrymandering or arranging electoral advantage, but that it is for the purpose of achieving fair and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> representation for all Australians, the sooner the standing of this Parliament will be greatly enhanced in the eyes of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my respectful submission, it contemporises population movements in Australia with the electorate and with the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, equality of political rights is inherent in a truly <span class="highlight">democratic</span> State . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using a rough rule of thumb, I do not believe that that variation from the quota is so bad that people could say that Tasmania received such fair or preferential treatment that it distorts the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I want the honourable member for Sydney to know that I welcome the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to the honourable member for Sydney that I am not frightened of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process and I will not directly involve myself in what boundaries are applicable when the House of Representatives next goes to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall the 3 Bills are fair, just and, above all, <span class="highlight">democratic</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same rime equality of political rights is inherent in a true <span class="highlight">democratic</span> state and the electoral system must not be used to benefit a particular Party and disadvantage the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My view about that is to this effect: In a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> state the reservation of this power to a GovernorGeneral who has shown that he does not operate on the advice of his Ministers is a reservation of power which this Parliament should not allow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is as plain as a pikestaff that if we have to reach that situation where an election at large is held we will see a first-class shemozzle in this country which will make a mockery of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have heard  ad nauseam  in the 2 1 years I have been a member of this place the case made out by the Country Party against proper <span class="highlight">democratic</span> political representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is again another mangling of the many efforts to try to make Australian political representation <span class="highlight">democratic</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recognise the fact that we are cornered inside the Constitution and can only, as near as practicable, make redistributions <span class="highlight">democratic</span> inside each State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not gain anything for the Parliament by suggesting otherwise, or by suggesting that we should have some principle which departs from the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously it is unthinkable that in a democracy we should not put into our legislation the basic steps by which the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process will come into operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To this end it recommended that no decision be taken in relation to its other recommendations until a reasonable time has elapsed and there has been an opportunity for the usual <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes to function, including, in this respect, parliamentary debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-40-26">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is contrary to <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles on which a country such as Australia should be able to say its Constitution rests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are failing the Australian people because we are not giving them the opportunity of stable government or government of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institutional nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am happy to see that provision as a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> protective device. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I briefly remind honourable members of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> threats that lie within the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until we resolve the question of the supremacy and the power of this Parliament there can be no continuing stability in our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This arrangement will not help the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process in this Parliament either. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We had a situation in which the 2 Houses of Congress were quite strongly controlled by the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If China and the Soviet Union had a common policy, as they did up till about 1958, 1 think that it would be extremely difficult for the United States and for countries associated with the United Statesthe <span class="highlight">democratic</span> countries of the world- to stand up to pressure from the 2 communist super powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the points I would like to make in connection with Indonesia is this: There seems to be the feeling among people whose general attitudes in Australian politics I strongly support that the alternative to the present type of government in Indonesia is in the broadest sense a left type of government, whether we consider it hopefully from our point of view a social <span class="highlight">democratic</span> type of government, a socialist government or even a government controlled by the Communist Party of Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The present right wing military Government in Indonesia is one which obviously does not hold the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> attitudes that we would expect in any Australian government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Reports of mass, indiscriminate killings have now come to Australia from Fretilin, which alleged that the Indonesians were ‘massacring’ the population and from Chinese sources, including from Taiwan, which claimed that the Chinese minority in East Timor bore the brunt of much of the indiscriminate killing in the territory from Timor <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Union- UDT- refugees in Portugal, many of whom claim actually to have witnessed atrocities of a disturbing kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In August 1968, when the Dubcek Government in Prague appeared to be engaged in policies inconsistent with the policies of Moscow, the result was that Warsaw Pact forces, including those of the U.S.S.R., by invasion of Czechoslovakia, caused a change in personnel in the government in Prague and caused a change in the minds of those who felt that they might indulge in policies more consistent with <span class="highlight">democratic</span> freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Historically speaking, I think there is little doubt that State governments, whether non-Labor or Labor, have left something to be desired when it comes to creating <span class="highlight">democratic</span> electoral systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Members of the Opposition have the hide to come into this House and talk about electoral gerrymanders when in their time in office they sought to destroy the very <span class="highlight">democratic</span> basis of the electoral system which-we heard the words from the honourable member for Port Adelaide- is based on the proposition that one vote has one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1974 the Australian people were given an opportunity by this Parliament to establish certain basic <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles about the conduct of elections and about the definition of electorate boundaries in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course it is a plot to destroy a number of Liberal seats as part of the punitive raid against the Liberal Party because it is to contest seats quite properly according to <span class="highlight">democratic</span> practices and principles held by National Party people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I see them they are: Firstly, it allows a concentration of the limited resources available to any government in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society on those in genuine need; secondly, it allows the average citizen greater ability to spend his money in the way in which he decides rather than have it taken away from him through increased taxation to pay for arrangements created by government and controlled by government; thirdly, it produces greater efficiency and accountability in the health care sector because of the recognition that the rate of increase in Government expenditure and in the percentage of gross national product expended on health cannot continue at its present rate and the recognition that there must be inefficiencies in our health care delivery due to this rapid expansion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matter that seems to attract the attention of the honourable member for St George is the threat to the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process and, by implication, the threat to the Australian economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Like my friend the honourable member for Isaacs, I believe that Parliament is still the best form of government yet devised for the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771004_reps_30_hor106/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The suggestion that in some way the representation involved in great areas, particularly rural districts, needs to be offset by damaging the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle of one man, one vote, one value relates to another responsibility of the Department of Administrative Services, and that is the facilities made available to members of parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is quite inappropriate that we should attack the basic <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle because of the inconvenience of spending more money to provide adequate representation to people who live in physically remote areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless that dictatorship changes its ways and acts in a proper and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way,’ the result will be that a communist regime will take over in that country because that will be the alternative to the oppression which is taking place now of a people who have enjoyed freedom possibly for longer than any country in Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party is in a dilemma because, on the one hand, its organisational strength comes from the union movement and, on the other hand, its essential weakness, its <span class="highlight">democratic</span> weakness, is that it is linked with the union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw the attention of the House tonight to the heroic stand being made by Noel Latham at Broken Hill against those who seek to trample his <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right to work into the dust of the Silver City. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A halt must be called somewhere along the line because what is happening to him could easily be the first step in the erosion of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights of all Australians, which are the rights that thousands of Australians went away, fought for and were either killed or maimed in supporting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As further evidence of the jackboot dictatorship that would smash our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> freedom I quote to the House the contents of a document distributed in Broken Hill by militant union officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Beyond that, and to speak about less tangible but perhaps fundamentally more important aspects, small business fosters a spirit of independence and initiative, so important in our liberal, <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say that this is excellent <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialist activity, and the Opposition welcomes the Government’s conversion to this cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-17-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Shortly after the Whitlam Government received the political count from the Australian people exercising their <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights at a free election, the Fraser-Anthony Government, in an honest endeavour to repair what in many cases was irreparable damage to Australian primary producers, as a matter of urgency extended the subsidy at the rate of $78.74 per tonne nitrogen in order to allow a close examination of the whole area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771019_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government talks about the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right of union members to control the policies and affairs of their unions and blames the communists for forcing members to go on strike against their will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For years and years now General Secretary Frank Mitchell and  President  Edgar Williams have been responsible for allowing one of the finest unions in Australia to detenorate into a disgraceful shambles with some of the worst awards in Australia and an utter comtempt for the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights of the union membership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, they have now been circumscribed so that the discretion of the Distribution Commissioners is exercised in a way which does not apply to any other <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any intrusion into the people’s rights means that the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles are not sustained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sustaining of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles has been on the basis that the occupant of the office has always acceded to the wishes of a Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fact that the Prime Minister might have given wrong advice in no way detracts from the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principles that he has to be answerable for that advice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every time a decision is made on a personal basis or deemed to be the prerogative of the occupant it is in our view an interference with the normal <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights that should prevail in any democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we are saying is that this legislation provides the Australian people with an excellent opportunity to have a look not only at this office but also at every aspect of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our view, if a solid case is made out on a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> principle there is no justification at all for an occupant of this office to exercise any powers relating to this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any intrusion or action is a denial of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course there will be a divergence of view but there must be a continuing sensitivity to the political climate, the political view, to ensure that our political establishment can be provided with the opportunity to go about its business without any undue stress or pressure from instrumentalities or devices which may be established which would subvert the functioning of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is really going against what one would call a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> proposal in terms of having an inquiry if the Tribunal is able to say to anybody who wishes to appear before it and who wishes to object to a licence being granted or wishes to raise certain issues which he or she feels are in the public interest: ‘We have determined that you have not a pecuniary interest and therefore you will not be entitled to appear at these proceedings’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill which permits the Tribunal to say: ‘You have not a pecuniary interest, so you will not have the right to appear’ virtually deprives a person of the normal <span class="highlight">democratic</span> right to appear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the normal <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process it would be appropriate that any member of Parliament should be entitled to know the decision and also to take part in a discussion as to that situation as the whole Bill relates to advice to the Minister as to what sort of licence he should grant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under clause 10, if we remove the right of a person who is deemed to have an interest and if we leave that to the Tribunal, we are negating the normal <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was immediately a chorus from <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party quarters that this recommendation had emanated from Cabinet and that the Government was trying to produce control of Catholic schools, deciding whom the schools could enrol and whom the could not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771107_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there had been an election for Cabinet by the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> means which the Labor Party follows in the selection of Cabinet, most of them would have been in the Cabinet and some of the no-hopers who are front benchers now would be back where they belong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the first place, he reflected that the number of electors who are opting to vote for the major parties in all the countries of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> West is decreasing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point among a number of others which he made is important, that is, for the good of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system there has to be instituted a continuity of policy quite beyond governments and quite beyond parties- a continuity of policy that an electorate will support, no matter which parties are elected to government or which private members are elected to government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One does not have to be a fan of Charles Dickens to understand that and one does not have to read  Hard Times  to realise that <span class="highlight">democratic</span> electorates, whether in Great Britain or in Australia, will reject any party that does not seek to say: ‘ We will give you a fair go ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such persons should understand that this Parliament is the fundamental institution and one of the most important traditions of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> community in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When a person in some way helps or joins a political party he is helping the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is good for people to want to join a political party of their choice and, through the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process, to try to give the public a choice of parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is necessary to realise that apart from questions of espionage, the security services ought to be concerned only with political activities which do not follow normal <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The measures which have been announced today strike the balance between the need to respond decisively to the threat of terrorism and the imperative of preserving Australia’s character as an open society and the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> freedoms we all hold paramount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that one of the strengths in our society’s sustaining its <span class="highlight">democratic</span> nature is by the way in which power and authority are dispersed in smaller areas within the overall structure of our system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of these things need to be clarified, but in clarifying them we should be guided by a basic concern about <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights and about civil liberties in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We cannot have confidence in the security and independence of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institutions of government if there is to be this unbounded power which presumably can be infected in its use by certain blandishments and approaches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present Opposition tries to turn democracy on its head and say how undemocratic it is to give the people of Australia a vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would have thought that is the one supreme moment when people are most <span class="highlight">democratic</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party has pursued this vigorous and personal vendetta not because he did anything wrong but because of its own bitterness and resentment at being denied the chance to carry through its plans to smash our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system and the principles and traditions by which we govern this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a new member of this the people’s House, I want to make it clear that it is my view that there can not be any consensus about the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process in Australia until the issues raised by the tactics and actions of successive leaders of the Liberal and National Country Party Oppositions in 1974 and 1975 are resolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tendency present in conservative governments towards the ‘blame the victim’ syndrome, constant denigration of the unemployed and union bashing simply distracts attention from the fundamental problem which faces national democracies such as Australia to establish effective <span class="highlight">democratic</span> control over national resources and their utilisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his 1975 policy speech  Mr Fraser  referred to the need to create more <span class="highlight">democratic</span> structures in the trade union movement and to reduce and make more accessible and responsible the government bureaucracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In what ways are these giant combines to be made accountable and democratically responsible to the Australian people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party is committed to the introduction of economic planning of the utilisation of Australia’s physical and human resources on a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No one could possibly argue that major insurance companies, banks, finance companies and multinational combines operate democratically or even that they are subject to the restraints of market forces, as the Prime Minister has suggested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The task ahead is to convert that reality to <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Today over most of northern Europe <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialism is the dominant and governing political force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The triumph of socialism in Europe reflects the growing conviction that a humane and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialism offers the only way forward from the economic and cultural malaise that now grips the capitalist world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They deliberately use points of order as a means of stopping us from having our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights as members of this Parliament and putting our case before the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It raises the question of the effectiveness of this Parliament and its place in our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could properly assume that he has a very positive view of the role that this House could and should have in the parliamentary process and in the process of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the parliamentary aspect of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government should be dignified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we could look again at the proper functions of this House- its legislative and control functions- and adapt our procedures to accommodate these functions properly, perhaps this chamber would become more than a place for permanent political campaigning and would again take its rightful place in our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As consciousness grows within the Labor movement and the Australian people about the consequences to them of decisions now been taken by the power elite, no amount of propaganda, manipulation or repression will be able to prevent this conservative coalition giving way to a more <span class="highlight">democratic</span>, more just, more equitable and more independent and self-reliant society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I make the point that the right of the Governor-General, and thus the government, to make such a proclamation which could affect persons who believe they are legitimately carrying out activities which they are entitled to perform in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society should also be accompanied by very definite and clear guidelines or requirements as to when and how such a declaration may be made and how the areas may be defined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all the honourable member- I think I quote him fairly accurately- referred to the need to protect in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way the rights of people carrying out functions, presumably in these waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must recognise and provide for the growing demands of individuals and community groups to be heard and to participate meaningfully in the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a time when <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institutions around the world, and particularly what should be the most fundamental <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institution of all, namely Parliament, are coming under increasing pressure, it is vital that we have a strong and effective parliamentary opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia is one of fewer than 20 countries in the entire world which still have democratically elected governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we want to preserve our basic <span class="highlight">democratic</span> freedoms, we are going to have to work for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The terrorists can never win in a constitutional democracy, provided that the leaders of democracies stick to their lastthat is, behave according to the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> mode of behaviour Never break its unspoken rules themselves and treat terrorists as criminals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What <span class="highlight">democratic</span> leaders must never do is to break the rules themselves and give the impression, however inadvertently perhaps, that because a bomb has gone off- a bomb about which nothing at all seems to be known as to its provenance- it is permissible to declare a local state of seige and thereafter cash in politically on that word terrorism . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  analysis of the vices of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> parliament that always tries to be over-popular, and hang the cost, also is relevant to the remarks I intend to make. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they undertake this sort of behaviour, if they breach all the conventions and if they tear up the normal principles of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> behaviour, they destroy the democractic process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Had the Government given careful consideration to the civil liberties and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights and freedoms of the Australian people in this matter it would have rejected outright the substance of the recommendations of the Hope report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Fraser Government exploits <span class="highlight">democratic</span> forms such as secret ballots, universal suffrage and general elections, but its spirit is essentially anti-<span class="highlight">democratic</span>, hierarchical and authoritarian, without that respect for minority opinion, compassion for the weak and capacity to take the long view which is the essence of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> spirit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Fascism was completely <span class="highlight">democratic</span> in form, relying as it did on universal suffrage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was essentially a product, or perversion, of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> procedures such as general elections, universal suffrage, universal literacy, large-scale advertising campaigns, referenda and mass parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no accident that the 1920s- the high water mark of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> forms in Europe- saw the rise of fascist parties in Italy, Germany, Hungary, Austria, Poland, Rumania and the Baltic States- all of them based on mass parties and universal suffrage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To take a more recent example, there can be little doubt that successive Ulster Unionist governments in Northern Ireland elected to the Stormont Parliament were elected according to <span class="highlight">democratic</span> forms and that they represented the fears, prejudices and hatreds of a majority of the Ulster Protestants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Ulster Unionist governments lacked, and what, I suggest, the Fraser Government in Australia lacks, is a sense of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> spirit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such hospitals are less and less subject to the establishment of overall health planning priorities and are using their considerable resources in ways which are not always in conformity with any proper <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The basic problem is that the whole structure- the interlocking connections between the doctors, the funds, the investment private hospitals and the control over the admission policies of large hospitals by the medical technocratsis an empire that is unable to insulate itself from <span class="highlight">democratic</span> control and responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This will mean more support for buses, and less for road construction; more responsibility for planning transport to meet local needs should be devolved to local government since the most practical and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> approach to co-ordination is local; greater emphasis should be placed on getting value for money, both in the financial regimes for the public sector industries and in the framework for decision-taking on particular schemes and services; there should be a more systematic and open involvement of people, Parliament, transport operators and unions in the continuing debate on transport and the formulation of policy; and this should be promoted by the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is absolutely necessary that the enormous range of powers that are available to the viceregal representative in this country are clearly denned and adequately circumscribed not only so that the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system can function but so that the confidence of the people in this community can be re-established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both countries have a high stake in the security and prosperity of other economically advanced <span class="highlight">democratic</span> powers in the world; in the continuation of the process of detente between the super-powers; in maintaining an open and nondiscriminatory regime in international trade; in encouraging a continuing United States presence in the Asia-Pacific region to the extent necessary to maintain a sound balance in that region; in opposing any attempt by the Soviet Union- or any other major power- to establish hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region; and in encouraging China to continue to play a constructive role in regional affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Australia was not invited to participate in the peace discussions even though we had committed our troops to fight in Vietnam, but I would have thought that at that stage any Australian, irrespective of his political persuasions, would have said that ‘full, free and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections’ meant that everybody over a certain age had the right to vote; that they would have some identity with the geographic area in which they lived; that the elected representatives would meet in an assembly; that a constitution would be drawn up providing for elections on a set basis; and that the representatives would select the leader. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are many pressures which contribute to the cause of family break-ups but to attach the responsibility of ascertaining the cause of family break-ups to a parliamentary committee that has the responsibility of trying to make more effective what has been an important piece of social legislation, of ironing out the very specific references that have already been referred to the Attorney-General and of producing a piece of legislation which will be relevant to a plural <span class="highlight">democratic</span> community so that the problems of divorce, maintenance and custody can be resolved in a way which is sensible and rational is to confuse the issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Wherever there is a dispute between <span class="highlight">democratic</span> and undemocratic forces, I shall always support the former- the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is a clear-cut difference that one is obviously more <span class="highlight">democratic</span> than the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Decisions taken by the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> countries to cancel foreign aid or not to send teams to the Olympic Games may well be correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it should be the aim of this Government to try to encourage other <span class="highlight">democratic</span> countries to act together in concert if we decide, as I think we have all decided to a large extent, that we are not prepared to support military intervention to defend democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way in which the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> countries, the so-called Western European countries, which have a fair amount of money and economic clout, can deal with these undemocratic countries is to use economic sanctions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  is essentially superficial and he did not set the context in which the statement was made, that Australia is a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> island in an authoritarian ocean and we are a wealthy enclave in an area which has had an extremely poor economic base but which is now rising rapidly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The aim of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialists or social democrats- honourable members can refer to me in either of those terms- is to make our society freer, fairer and more enterprising and to recognise that enterprise does not have to be solely in the private sector any more than it should be solely in the public sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another question is: How do we expand the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institutions of the world? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The article, by  Mr Brian  Chapman, a South Australian graduate student from the University of Oregon, points out that good health through physical culture is enshrined in the German <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Republic’s Constitution and is backed up by legislation through the Youth Act 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should be leading in the mobilisation of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> forces of the world to establish a United Nations body, not the stronghold of IS 1 officialdoms, but the voice of the people of the world, through a constituent assembly, perhaps along the lines of the soon-to-be-elected Parliament of Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That will be a serious matter, not only for Australia but for the rest of the world because, as I said earlier, this Parliament is one of the few remaining <span class="highlight">democratic</span> deliberative assemblies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Considering the way in which the Leader of the House  (Mr Sinclair)  runs this place, the word ‘<span class="highlight">democratic</span>’ should be used in inverted commas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To fight this trade, and fight it within a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> framework and within the rule of law, the Government needs special powers; powers that are not commonly accorded to law enforcement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some may suggest that the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process has within it the seeds of its own destruction, a fatal weakness centering on its very liberalism, a weakness because of its insistence on allowing and encouraging debate and dissent, a weakness exemplified internally by a failure to deal with small groups holding the nation to ransom and externally by hesitancy in opposing anti-<span class="highlight">democratic</span> forces and an inability to sustain long term resistence in the event of conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It just would not be true to say that all unions would act in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way, free from judicial interference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taking the full extent of the continuum, on one end is the totalitarian state where secret police are an essential instrument of coercion and control, and at the other end is an ideal <span class="highlight">democratic</span> state which is fully confident about its internal situation and which needs no protection against its own citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, those who wish to preserve an open and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society need to be peculiarly aware of, and concerned about, the secret arm of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that paradoxically it is necessary that we have a secret arm of government to preserve an open and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society, but that should never render us complacent about the supervision, accountability and responsibility of that organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>History should warn us that the so-called guardians of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way of life often becomes its gravediggers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These agencies have been used by at least one American President to deny American citizens their <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights, and in fact used by him to corrupt the electoral process which is surely at the heart of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are limitations upon what a security organisation should do in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, we know that ASIO in this country has leaked material to the Press in order to help to corrupt the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need to ensure that, as in other <span class="highlight">democratic</span> societies, the secret agencies of government do not contaminate the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of these situations which I have just mentioned- the Weimar, Salisbury and the ASIO responsibility to the CIA- deny the responsibility of the intelligence agency to the democratically elected government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus in seeking to avoid what I call the Nixon perversion, there is a real danger of allowing an autonomy to the intelligence agency which is equally subversive of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It can be rightfully and truthfully said that they reflect the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the real situation is as described by Benn and Peters at page 2 13 of  Social Principles of the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> State  wherein they wrote:  lt is a paradox of freedom, that we must set a constraint to catch a constraint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As it is, we have a long way to go before we can say that we have a genuine <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Bill will put the Organisation beyond the Parliament and beyond <span class="highlight">democratic</span> control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem with the first group is that it may become despairing about the possibility of society solving its difficulties, may adopt a paranoically threatening view of the external world and may look to a security service rather than a well informed, vigorous and sceptical <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system to maintain stability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me give honourable members a horrific example from a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> country of how an essentially paranoid view about secrecy can create general hysteria and distort and pervert the traditional norms of law and justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because a country is <span class="highlight">democratic</span>, must everything be known? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no fair justification in a free and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society such as ours for that sort of restraint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the ethnic community- this would be the case with the rest of Australia if subjected to a similar experienceresent the efforts by the Government to try to condition them to accept political propaganda which is slanted in a way that tends to favour the Government and they resent the enormous dilution of essential facts which should become commonplace information through any public broadcast or television service in a free and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There must be criticism of all the functioning bodies serving a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system and, although a degree of secrecy must be respected for our security agencies, that secrecy must be kept at the minimal practical level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The emotionalism which has been associated with so much of the objection to constructive critics in the past in my view has been couched out of concern to protect our security agency from any sort of criticism rather than a genuine concern about establishing or maintaining the minimal level of secrecy consistent with the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights of the community and, on the other hand, an appropriately effective functioning of a security service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This practice is regarded as basic in various parts of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> world and should be regarded as basic in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these countries do not have the same political or <span class="highlight">democratic</span> outlook that we have as a nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other <span class="highlight">democratic</span> nations- or supposedly <span class="highlight">democratic</span> nations- the degree of sacrifice is far greater than phone tap or search warrant powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hope arising above expectations to expect Australia irrespective of its political leadership or <span class="highlight">democratic</span> consequences to remain aloof from world affairs, the consequences of world trade and our own defence requirements throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is terribly important for all of us to realise that the distinction between <span class="highlight">democratic</span> countries and non-democatic countries is relatively narrow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most important differentiation between <span class="highlight">democratic</span> countries and undemocratic and totalitarian countries is that in <span class="highlight">democratic</span> countries people have a right to disagree with the governments in those countries and the right to organise to remove those governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, they are not prepared to rely on persuasion, propaganda, rational argument, voting, meetings, marches or whatever else is considered to be part of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important thing is that it ought to be plain to the people who run our intelligence organisations that they are under parliamentary supervision, that the people in general believe in the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process, that we do not want ASIO to interfere with what we consider to be legal though perhaps extremely unpopular political movements and that we have to protect the civil liberties of individuals in this society although they may be people who hold the most unpopular views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What distinguishes a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society from an undemocratic society is the protection of the right to disagree- to disagree with the vast majority of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The central issue is the relative priority to be given to the power of two institutions: First, the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> Parliament, the method of operation of which is open and subject to intensive scrutiny by the Press and by the public; and secondly, a bureaucratic secret organisation the method of operation of which is unknown and is not subject to any scrutiny at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the organisation itself or by a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> and responsible community? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the difference between an organisation that is essentially frozen inside its castle and an organisation which is not frozen, such as this Parliament, which is subject to <span class="highlight">democratic</span> pressures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are exempt from any form of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we do believe in the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system- we all know it has been under very great threat in recent years- I hope we will not do something that weakens the strength of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institutions by our own act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has no respect for the civil rights of persons and no respect for the legal rights of citizens in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A financial accountability therefore is vitally important in ensuring that a security agency stays within the bounds of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately the experience of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> societies of security organisations has not been good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe we are discussing one of the fundamental issues of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 1979 elections were contested by the People’s National Party, Popular Front Party, United National Convention, Action Congress Party, Third Force Party and Social <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Front. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-34-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is part of the normal <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point again is that that puts in an extremely subjective judgment, because the word ‘ultimately’ might mean 100 years, 150 years or 200 years, and that could lead to such an extraordinarily cautious or repressive view being taken of what is legitimate or illegitimate behaviour that we will find ASIO’s powers being extended in a way which I think is quite objectionable in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> community like ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely within the context of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society that is their right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a creature of the Australian <span class="highlight">democratic</span> body politik. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly does not- as has been suggested by honourable members opposite in this debate- prevent people from going out into the community and advocating a different form of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am referring to an historic situation where it was the considered view of the people who now comprise this Government that that sort of action was undermining the whole <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system and there was no way that such action by a citizen would not fall within this definition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society the Parliament was responsible for and required to provide that protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The dilemma of this clause is that it imposes a responsibility on the Director-General which means that he does have seriously to consider whether he is going to waste the time and funds of his organisation by placing officers of security in buildings in Brisbane to take photographs of people who are exercising their <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether one likes street marches or not, that argument is really part of the ongoing <span class="highlight">democratic</span> argument in our community and in my view ought to be excluded from security surveillance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we have to be very realistic in our consideration of this matter because there are certain elements within the trade union movement- and I hasten to add, before anybody from the Opposition side jumps on me, that they are extreme minority elementswhich would not be <span class="highlight">democratic</span> in their intentions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What sort of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> parliamentary institution are we if we really are abdicating our rights and saying to somebody else: ‘You take them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we ought to be trying in this case to ensure that this legislation will in fact carry out the functions of enhancing security and of ensuring that the security organisations in Australia are able to carry out their functions and that the people of Australia will have confidence that they are carrying out those functions in a manner which the people of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society are entitled to expect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ability to establish a security file on a matter which is deemed to be subversive but which is not illegal would seem to be an extension of the inroads into the legal rights of citizens which should not be tolerated in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We social democrats or <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialists- in other words, we members of the Labor Party- believe that people do best if they operate in a mixed economy, that is, a private business sector operating in partnership with a government sector, in which the operation of market forces is controlled by the government either through legal rules or through direct intervention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course we know that the current Leader of the Australian Democrats is Leader of the Democrats and there is an effective, viable minority party in the form of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> party, because of the behaviour of the Prime Minister and the way that the former Minister,  Senator Chipp,  left the Government coalition parties as a protest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No one in this House or in this nation should lose sight of one of the resolutions of the Australian Labor Party conference at Adelaide earlier this year to the effect that an Australian Labor Party government would recognise the rights of unions to regulate their affairs in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way free from government and judicial interference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Their purpose and their basic work is to look after their members, to negotiate on their behalf, to put forward proposals for consideration, to make requests and to do the kinds of things in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society that are expected for the betterment of the workers’ lot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The recognition of the rights of unions to regulate their own affairs in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way free from government and judicial interference and at the same time expanding the role of the Industrial Registrar in advising on matters relating to rules so that unions will have access to information and independent advice which will allow them - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that at the ALP conference in Adelaide the person who I suppose will soon become a member of this House,  Mr Bob  Hawke, endeavoured to establish what would have been a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process for the union movement in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Hawke  said that he wanted a contract referendum policy- a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are decisions of the United Nations arrived at by including the votes of the leaders of countries who rule by the sword rather than by popular <span class="highlight">democratic</span> vote? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They were drawn up on the basis of having full, free <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections in Vietnam and they were never allowed to operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If such legislation is allowed to persist in this country which means that people can be incarcerated or fined simply because they have expressed their <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights it will lead to a very fascist-like domination of the trade union movement and many other movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister should also state that, on the basis of ordinary <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights, they are entitled to hold a meeting and should not be refused those rights because somebody grabs hold of a law and says: Look, you have to get permission but we will not give you permission; so if there is a meeting, you will be arrested’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those imposed in conformity with the law and which are necessary in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society in the interests of national security or public safety, public order … the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been <span class="highlight">democratic</span> debate there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last point I mention is the way in which the smokescreen has been thrown up to divert attention from the left wing and Labor-inspired activities of people who seek to abuse the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights of others in this country by false and fake assemblies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we are to work seriously towards an equitable and efficient system of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> government in Australia, it is essential that we try to achieve a mutual respect and co-operation amongst the three levels of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, we get back to my point about the cynical abuse of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process, of promising something to win an election and then conveniently discovering that circumstances will not allow its implementation ‘at this point of time’, to use one of the phrases the Prime Minister uses so cynically and so often. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>South Africans, ultimately cannot hold out against what must occur; that is, rule by the majority of the people; one man, one vote; a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society as much as we have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The South Africans must aim at an objective of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would hope that in some way the South Africans would work step by step- even if it took 20 years- at least to bring about a just <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His contempt for <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes is very evident in the current public brawl with the Queensland Liberal Party over the issue of the next Senate elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This practice is regarded as basic in various pans of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> world and should be regarded as basic in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, the amendment does involve taking the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> operations of the Parliament on trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we on the Opposition side ask ‘Who determines the reasons of state that overturn the fundamental principle on which a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society is based?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government is very silly and very trite if it believes that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, despite its antidemocratic track record, is going to be a better judge of national security and the people’s <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights than those who have been elected to serve the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the way it ought to be in any <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Hoover problem is the creation of an independent agency which is too independent of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> authorities in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my view that the way in which clause 8 has been phrased opens up this society to the danger that ASIO will effectively escape <span class="highlight">democratic</span> control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our amendment tries to strengthen effective <span class="highlight">democratic</span> control first of all by inserting a general access provision in the form of proposed sub-clause (3). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Opposition is trying to do is to give to the democratically elected Executive general access to the information of ASIO, subject to the limitations about specific individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless that is done, Ministers of the Crown and their colleagues, leading figures either in Government or Opposition, might be subjected to ASIO’s surveillance without the knowledge of any member of the democratically elected Executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask members on both sides of the Committee to take this clause very seriously because it remains the only major clause which allows some form of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> control through the Executive over ASIO operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it will not stop the charade that goes on; it will not stop the  Speaker  putting on his robes and the Parliament continuing all of the ceremony; it will not stop the talk about our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system when Parliament is opened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it is not part of the dialectical process of argument, debate, voting, open power struggles more or less openly resolved, that are characteristic of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think we have more to fear from our own manipulation or perversion of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process than from any external threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words Australia has far more to fear from our own self-induced destruction of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process than from external threat or the thought of spies with sinister beards and bombs in their pockets who come amongst us in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The implication that in order to preserve democracy in this country it is necessary to disregard <span class="highlight">democratic</span> safeguards I find not only an odious argument but actually a stupid argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A <span class="highlight">democratic</span> security service in Australia is a contradiction in terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that the very secrecy of its workings means that it gets more and more remote from what is going on in the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> mainstream in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If a Minister is not answerable in this place, we lose any pretence of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> control through the Parliament about what is going on in ASIO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is much more evidence to suggest that security organisations in fact have contributed to the undermining of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system in a variety of countries than they have actually assisted in preserving it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the answer is no, how does the Minister justify in a so-called <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society the denial of such information not to the Parliament but to the elected Executive? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are going to stand up here and solemnly declare that we who are the direct representatives of this <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society are going to allow ourselves to be treated as inferior to public servants- in effect the faceless people who are nameless and who constitute the Public Service- called ASIO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is abundant evidence, I think, that there is a great deal of collusion between the great international systems and that ASIO, MI6, the KGB and the Central Intelligence Agency have more in common with each other than with the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system in our own country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a fact that earlier this month the Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the New <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Party was expelled from the Republic of Korea National Assembly by a vote of the Government parties for his allegedly anti-nationalist attitude in calling on the United States to withdraw its support for the Government of the Republic of Korea and for publicly suggesting that the United States should exert direct and public pressure on  President  Park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are not talking about a desire to have sophisticated propaganda units, but of the need for the Opposition to give some sense of fairness to the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process, to have adequate resources for research and to inform and assist the Opposition in an analysis of the Government’s policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a matter that has worried other parliaments and other people who are concerned for the process of government in countries where the system of government is <span class="highlight">democratic</span> and, particularly, where the Westminster system of democracy is operating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A related and important objection is that the Estimates committees de-politicise our activities, minimising the critical attacking political function that is an essential part of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is also undisputed, however, that material success alone does not guarantee community satisfaction and the deficiencies of the previous Government of the Republic of Korea in representing what we would generally regard as basic <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights have been the cause of a great deal of dissatisfaction in the Republic of Korea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recording our sadness at the manner of the late President’s death we also feel a need to observe that perhaps the new government might find it timely to initiate a program aimed at establishing broadly and comprehensively the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights of the people ofKorea including the basic rights of the members of its National Assembly under a new constitution to reinforce the impressive material gains which have been made in its economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I congratulate the honourable member for Lilley  (Mr Kevin Cairns)  for joining the philosophy of <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialism and establishing for us this evening that the biggest influences on centralism and dehumanising the economic system under which we live are to be found not in the public sector but in the private sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps there is a tendency for policy makers in <span class="highlight">democratic</span> systems to listen to the highly organised and highly articulate welfare groups, which leads mainly to income transfers being made from middle income earners to other middle income earners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can well understand the feeling of people who have been forced to flee from their homelands because of persecution of themselves or thenfamilies and who have risked their lives in order to seek for themselves and their families a new, secure and <span class="highlight">democratic</span> future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The challenge to traditional <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialism has been expressed in a number of deeply dispiriting doctrines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This sort of approach strikes directly at the conventional <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialist notion that equality and equity can only be assured by a stronger public sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential to the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This case attacks the very roots of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">democratic</span> movement in the Soviet Union has received some severe setbacks in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, no person who believes in <span class="highlight">democratic</span> rights and civil liberties or who feels that it is the right of an individual to practise religion, politics or such other acceptable social activities as he sees as being within his interests, thinks that those rights should be denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such regimes are not limited to the Soviet Union but many do not profess to be libertarian or <span class="highlight">democratic</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not taken by a group of Western <span class="highlight">democratic</span> conservative governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia but we were biased in favour of freedom, in favour of a pluralist type society and in favour of a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it is important to have <span class="highlight">democratic</span> freedom in the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If people had <span class="highlight">democratic</span> freedoms, the nationality questions would be resolved in a <span class="highlight">democratic</span> manner inside the United Soviet Socialist Republics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no argument whatsoever with the Opposition ‘s <span class="highlight">democratic</span> responsibilities in advancing its own policy but I believe that I have a very real responsibility to warn the Australian people that if Labor proceeds to re-introduce a Medibank-type arrangement it will return this country to the great health cost explosion which occurred when Labor was last in Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is their choice in this <span class="highlight">democratic</span> society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parliament and its members by their very nature must expect comment or criticism- it is of the substance of our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did begin as a seemingly academic institution but its <span class="highlight">democratic</span> structure has encouraged Aboriginal participation and involvement in crucial community needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we had the conflict between Fretilin and the Timorese <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Union which was an excuse for the Indonesians to take over the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sad thing about it is that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  when Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, implied that really most of the losses had occurred during the civil war between the Fretilin and the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Union of Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliament has its place as a place for free speech and free debate in the interests of the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> institutions of our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the courts of this country, in the administration of justice as we know it, have equal importance in our <span class="highlight">democratic</span> processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that is what <span class="highlight">democratic</span> socialism is all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The way in which the term ‘orderly’ is used sometimes reminds me of some states that have never held an election in their history yet manage to use the word ‘<span class="highlight">democratic</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘<span class="highlight">Democratic</span>’ is a nice word as long as it is not too precisely defined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A report by the International Committee of the Red Cross proves that only 1,500 people died in the civil war between the Fretilin and the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Union of Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As much as possible in serving the needs of a civilian society, we must maintain a commitment which philosophically is consistent with the standards of a civilian society- not of a paramilitary society or of a militaristic society- in a pluralistic <span class="highlight">democratic</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, since World War II the characteristic of all nationsboth <span class="highlight">democratic</span> and undemocratic nations- has been that public expenditures have come to operate an increasing proportion of the expenditures, the revenues and the flows of finance within any community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My recollection is that  Mr C.  B. Byrne, then a distinguished senator from Queensland, represented the <span class="highlight">Democratic</span> Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let us be under no illusion that the kinds of powers are a threat to the whole <span class="highlight">democratic</span> way of life which we encourage in this society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, action taken to restore, or perhaps to endow, the public with faith in the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process is essential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-37-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Agreement has now been reached on an independence constitution, and on arrangements for the transitional period leading to the holding of free and fully <span class="highlight">democratic</span> elections in Rhodesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other days I have participated- successfully too- in the marshalling of student ideas and energies towards the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They cannot exercise it individually and, therefore, they must have a system of entrusting the sovereignty to others; and that is the <span class="highlight">democratic</span> parliamentary system in which we are elected, by a group of people in Australia, to come here and speak for them and represent them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
