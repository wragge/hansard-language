<ul>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand the honourable senator’s final point as to the general thinking, he was speaking in support of an independent tribunal to which persons who are refused <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> could appeal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why has  Mr A.  J. Vorstman of 8 Pandora Street,Boondall, Queensland, been refused <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700407_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many persons have applied for <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> and have been refused in the same period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It indicates a new political awareness on the part of the Government which may flow into another area which is of great interest to migrants in Australia - he area of <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that this Agreement is an indication that from now on the Government will not use the political opinions or activities of migrants as a basis for refusal of <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>, as this has led to considerable intimidation of migrant communities throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that we will get a considerable number of people whose political opinions or activities will be concerned with policies of the left, but I trust that the Government will not impose upon them the same penalties in connection with <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> that have been imposed upon the people who have lived in Australia for 19 years and who, because of activities with left wing parties or involving left wing policies, have been refused <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I promised to write to you again concerning the question of establishing an appeals tribunal to review applications for <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> which have been rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1844, it has been a uniform feature of <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> legislation to give a wide discretion to the executive to grant or refuse <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise this matter because this Spanish migrant, who has sought twice to be naturalised, has been refused <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a communication to me dated 24th February 1970, the Minister for Immigration states that the Minister may grant or refuse an application for <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In support of my claim that a need exists for the establishment of such a tribunal to consider the matter of applications for <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>,I believe that we all know that in early post-war years after 1945, in the aftermath of World War II, it was very hard at times to identify people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose I could say that if screening was effective in the first instance obviously ultimate <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> would just be a formality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not say that this is a vice or a virtue, but we do get this kind of no-man’s land in relation to the rejection of applications for <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know also that the number of migrants whose applications for <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> are rejected runs into three figures each year, but it has diminished to a degree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>appeal against a refusal of <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> is long overdue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is so, the onus is on the Government to prove to me just what  Mr Villegas  has done in Australia that has led the Department to refuse him <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is not one honourable senator here who has not had success on occasions when he has raised cases in respect of which <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> has been refused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will appreciate that one an easily become labelled.I am not affected personally, but migrants seeking <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> can be affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has borrowed many ideas from the Labor Party.I hope that it will borrow our civil liberties policy and will introduce a tribunal of review for rejected applicants for <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Vorstman’s application has been carefully considered on previous occasions but it has been decided that Australian citizenship by <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> should not be granted to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700407_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true they have admitted they have been wrong on <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> applications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within the last 48 hours I have approached the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Lynch)  on another matter regarding <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> rejections in company with a deputation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a long while we have chided the Government about its attitude to <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> vetoes and even to entry permits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only a few weeks ago the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  finally obtained from  Mr Lynch  figures in relation to the people who have been refused <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the chamber still believe that the ratio is not as it should be, but there has been an admission that <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> has been denied to some people  on  the far right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Queensland, who has been refused <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In about April of this year I asked in this chamber why  Mr Vorstman  had been refused <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Vorstman’s application has been carefully considered on previous occasions bur it has been decided that Australian citizenship by <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> should not be granted to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The following table shows the number of nonEuropean aliens granted Australian citizenship by <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> in each  of  the years 1960-1969, inclusive: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1968 she lodged an application for <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> but was informed that she was not eligible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most honourable senators have been to numerous <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> ceremonies where
          emphasis is placed on privileges and responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During this debate I drew attention
          to people who had been refused <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> and 1 included a lengthy table of
          rejections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I put this
          to  Senator Greenwood:  Sometimes I have the
          opportunity of attending <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> ceremonies in the Prime Minister’s
          electorate of Lowe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Government, for a political reason, refuses him <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the countries of origin of the 275 person refused <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>, and the reasons tor such refusal; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have relaxed certain aspects of the <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> procedures so that migrants will more readily accept Australian citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The method of <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> of migrants has been relaxed to the extent that they no longer have to go as far in swearing an oath as they previously did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 remind the Committee again, that some of the matters which  Senator Poyser  referred to in relation to <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>, social service benefits, migrant education and migrant accommodation, among other things, have come out of the work which the existing  committees  and councils have done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point at which I take umbrage - it is based on an article written by a journalist named John Stockhouse - is that there is a difference between native born Australians who visit Fiji and those visitors who have acquired citizenship by <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#debate-68">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I asked why he was not granted <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> I was told that it was because he had carried a banner of protest outside the Spanish Embassy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I and other senators have attended virtually hundreds of <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> ceremonies at which we are told about the privileges, responsibilities and rights of people becoming citizens of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-57-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some years ago  Mr Lynch  as Minister for Immigration belatedly conceded that some of the people who were refused <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> were connected with a certain organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How long did it take the Government suddenly to lower the boom on <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> applications from some of these people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to the Attorney-General that the ASIO people and others have made some blunders at times in relation to <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Pilioras  said that he had been asked to surrender his passport by Australian authorities as one of the conditions of <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> ceremonies migrants are told that they have become Australian citizens and have the rights and privileges of every other Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a recent statement by the Minister for Immigration that the Government’s policy is to abandon the oath cf allegiance at <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> ceremonies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>replying to  Senator Durack  who had asked a question about the form of words , to be used in the ceremony of <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At no time during my chairmanship have such new form* of words for <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> been submitted by the Council to the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, the former Attorney-General set himself up as the champion of civil liberties, the man who presided over the administration of a department which repeatedly refused <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> to citizens of this country who had never been convicted of any offence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, leaving that case aside, all citizens should be treated on exactly the same basis and no distinction should be drawn between those who are citizens by birth and those who are citizens by <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> or citizenship application. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that because I know people who were grossly victimised when they applied for <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> and who, when we protested, were granted citizenship - and that ASIO then approached them and asked them whether they would serve in certain listening post capacities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder why it granted <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> to a gentleman who has been a resident in Australia for some 20 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the Labor Party, that is all right in relation to persons whose activities are such as those of  Mr Burchett  who was given a passport by the new Government and the man who was granted <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> by the new Government after he had made many applications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has justification for what it has done in regard to trade unions, <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> and  Mr Wilfred  Burchett. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude of the previous Government was that the criterion for <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> was whether one would make a good Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it not a fact that the said Drago  Brutusha  is a member of HOP and a former member of Ustasha, and that Ivan Budkovic is alleged to be a former member of the Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood and was refused <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> by the previous Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is also proposed administratively to replace the term ‘<span class="highlight">Naturalisation</span> ceremony’ with ‘citizenship ceremony’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The word ‘<span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>’ is one which does nol come easily to the tongue, lt is clumsy and has, for many, connotations totally unconnected with citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe that <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> gives to an Australian citizen absolutely and without equivocation the same rights under the law as natural born Australians possess under that very same law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Going back as far as that and even beyond, I always have thought that the paramountcy of the certificate of <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> conferring citizenship should be acknowledged at all times and in all circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He extended the debate by expounding on how we have created a climate in which this legislation becomes necessary, but when he and his colleagues were in office they created substantial fears in the migrant communities by refusing <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> to certain migrants because of political activity or political thinking contrary to the views of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The previous Government intimidated migrants by creating in them the fear that if they participated in the normal political activities of this country they would be refused <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Very soon after the previous government was defeated one of the first acts of the Department of Immigration was to naturalise a migrant who had been refused <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> for about 19 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I support bis <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> and the subsequent <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> of many people who previously had been refused <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>, for political ‘ reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have already indicated that people who have been refused <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> are now being naturalised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister consider preparing a series of statements in the various languages and, where a naturalised Australian citizen seeks to return to a homeland which does not necessarily recognise Australian <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>, arrange for that person to be handed a statement indicating the position in regard to the country he proposes to visit, making it clear to him that his Australian nationality does not necessarily guarantee that he will be allowed to return to this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are to be known as citizenship ceremonies instead of <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> ceremonies, a description with which most of us are familiar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For migrants from other countries the period has been 5 years, after which they seek citizenship through the processes of <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only road to Australian citizenship is via 3 years residency and then a <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> or citizenship ceremony. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>‘<span class="highlight">Naturalisation</span> ceremony’ is the form which has been used for many years and in many countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, this Bill deals with the migrant after he has gone through this developing phase of deciding to come to Australia, whatever may be the reason, and adapting and adjusting himself and getting to the stage where he is seeking to become a complete member of this country and to accept <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I cannot understand the Minister’s statement that the word ‘<span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>’ is more difficult to pronounce than the word ‘citizenship’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As long ago as 1963- a decade ago- the then committee on <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> of the Immigration Advisory Council recommended the same action as the citizenship committee recommended in January 1973: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the second place, loss of original nationality results automatically from <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> in the case of persons who were originally nationals of countries such as the USA, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, France, Austria, Norway and Sweden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although the statistics for conferral of citizenship by <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> have been recorded on a monthly basis, until the beginning of 1973 the figure for notification and registration have been prepared on a six monthly basis only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A person will come here from elsewhere and before even being qualified for <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> we will have him taking an oath of allegiance which will render him stateless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I admit that I am offended by what  Senator Greenwood  had to say, because it reminds me of the many times I made representations on behalf of people who for many years were refused <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are unsupportable because the grounds for refusal of <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> are associated not with politics but with some other reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-For instance, I remember not proceeding with a case for <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> when I was informed unofficially and confidentially- I do not doubt that  Senator Greenwood  would be so informed if he sought reasons, not in this case but in others- that the person concerned was a proven Nazi collaborator; that he had been before a court and had been convicted of that offence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that case, I did not proceed with my support for his application for <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall from my days in local government saying to migrants at <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> ceremonies that they should learn the language of this country so that they could talk to people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate may be interested to know that I played a leading part in the removal of <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> ceremonies from the courts of law into the chambers of local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That prompted me, when I was President of the Local Government Association in New South Wales, to prevail upon local governments throughout the Commonwealth to make an effort to have <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> ceremonies removed from the courts of law into the chambers of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That move has been an outstanding success, and I am sure that on all occasions when <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> ceremonies have been held what has happened in my council chambers has happened in council chambers throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have been assured that there is no difference between those who are Australian by birth and those who are Australian by <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was very pleased when on one occasion, after a <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> ceremony, a person came to me and said: ‘You are not only the mayor of Albury but you are the uncrowned king of the Greeks’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our organisations consist mainly of Australians, either by birth or <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>, many of whom have Polish origin with a love for sport and culture, and are naturally proud of their heritage, but do not want to participate in any politics and do not agree to fighting old Homeland battles here in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To endeavour and encourage a continuous voluntary association of residents of Doonside and those of neighbourhood either Australian Citizens by birth or <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> or citizens to be, and to promote thereby a realistic process of integration based upon pursuit of mutual interests, direct social relations without discrimination resulting from origin, race, religion or political beliefs. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I well understand the problems in which  Senator Mulvihill  has been interested, especially those concerning people applying for <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> and migration to this country and the general pursuit of civil liberties about which he has been so ardent for so long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770906_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The modifications, which the Treasurer announced yesterday, are designed to provide a framework for the ‘<span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>’ of foreign owned companies over a period of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A company in the process of <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> would be given prior credit for achieving 5 1 per cent Australian ownership and would therefore be able to proceed with a new project on the same basis as outlined above. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government would expect the <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> process to takeplace primarily by way of new share issues to Australians to fund new projects and expansions, rather than by takeovers which will remain subject to case-by-case examination under the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As pan of the arrangements there would need to be a general understanding with the major shareholder interests of the company on the process of <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> and the exercise of voting powers in respect of the Australian business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For 20 years he was refused <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But even on this view, <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> seems simply to be one among a number of criteria which can be weighed and balanced by a court in determining whether that degree of absorption has in fact taken place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, one still can have a situation where someone has been in Australia for just three years, applies immediately for <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> and, I am suggesting, can be construed as the law now stands as an immigrant for the purposes of federal statute law and for the purposes of the reach of federal constitutional power, and as such be then liable to the impact of these particular sections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government introduced the ‘<span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>’ concept into its foreign investment policy in June 1978 as an incentive to partly Australian owned foreign companies to increase their Australian ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-127-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In announcing arrangements for the <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> of predominantly foreign owned companies, I indicated on 8 June 1978 that it was a matter for individual companies to decide on the basis of their own commercial judgments where to participate in the new arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-69">[More…]</a></p>
