  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I am concerned - I come in contact with this sort of thing so often in relation to the <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> of people, the issuing of passports and other administrative decisions - we must by some means or other remove from executive authority the power by administrative decree to withhold from any Australian or any person a fundamental right <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Immigration: Is it a fact that immigrants are encouraged to believe that <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> will entitle them to all the privileges of Australian citizenship? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is he aware of the concern and resentment of elderly migrants who find that, in spite of <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>, they are denied the age pension because they have not been in Australia for 10 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 preface my question to the Minister for Social Services by reminding him that yesterday the honourable member for Perth asked the Minister for Immigration whether he was aware of the concern and resentment of elderly migrants who found that, in spite of <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>, they are denied the age pension because they have not been in Australia for 10 years and he referred to their complaints of being treated as second class citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was in 1966, if I remember correctly, that the <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> qualification for pensions was removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I spent the day in my office and attended a <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> ceremony that night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there a residency qualification, notwithstanding <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>, of 10 years for eligibility for an age pension and 5 years for eligibility for an invalid pension for migrants from most countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that his applications for <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> and Australian citizenship have been rejected because he is a member of the Australian Communist Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I question the justification of the Government’s rejecting an application for <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> merely because a person belongs to the Australian Communist Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the total number of migrants resident in Australia who are eligible for <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> but who as yet have not applied for <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, what disabilities does an alien face in Australia and what benefits does <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> confer? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Democracy as well as the Parliament and the people are not well served if the member of Parliament feels that his sole responsibility is h s electorate; if he feels that he has no responsibility for what is happening in the rest of Australia; or if he feels that all he need do is attend charity bazaars and <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> ceremonies and kiss a baby or two. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman is aware that there are over 200,000 migrants eligible for <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> who have not applied for same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, we are somewhat concerned at he failure of the Governmentto provide visas for overseas visitors, at the refusal of <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> and many other allied matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of these people are naturalised and many more are awaiting <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This young man applied for <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>, but his request has not been acceded to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is the reason for his failure to get <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>, it should be stated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were looking forward to <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, they offered the view that they were afraid to take part in political activity because of a general feeling that migrants who took part in political parties other than the Government parties may be refused <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the Minister has assured the House that the numbers refused <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> for political reasons were small, I am very concerned with the development of this view among migrants under our immigration plan, particularly amongst such a very responsible group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member also referred to the <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> of migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In what ways are immigrants disadvantaged under law in Australia either before or after <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As indicated above the entry rules are the same for New Zealand citizens by birth and by <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When adult aliens have been in Australia for 4 years they receive a letter from the Minister reminding them of their eligibility to apply for <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> and inviting them to lodge an application. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This action is taken because the average length of residence at the time of <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> has been found to be over 8 years; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every argument the Leader of the Opposition used in this debate today, and when introducing his own Bill, and every statement he has made at <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> ceremonies - misusing ceremonies of <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> around the country - has been a distortion or a bending of the truth, as I will now proceed to demonstrate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That truth is that at 30th June 1971, the latest time for which statistics are available, there were 228,700 people eligible to seek <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> who had not applied for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that by the imposition of a <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> requirement the Leader of the Opposition is putting a price on Australian nationality - $17 a week, the amount of the present age pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Shortly, Australians will be able to speak of citizenship rather than <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> ceremonies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know of a case - 1 will not name the gentleman concerned, but his wife would be known to many honourable members opposite as well as to many Government supporters - in which over a long period a man was refused <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> by the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When he is naturalised, I will be proud to go to the <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> ceremony in Canberra and shake his hand, because he was done a terrible wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it applied only to Australian citizens and therefore ignored those people who had lived and worked in Australia for a long time but had not taken out <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourthly, it substitutes the term ‘citizenship ceremony’ for the present description used in the legislation: <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> ceremony’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition supports the change of name for the function at which migrants become Australians from ‘<span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> ceremony’ to ‘cit izenship ceremony’, lt supports also the move to lower the age at which a person becomes eligible to citizenship, from 21 to 18 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Registration whereby a migrant with the status of British subject or an Irish citizen who is eligible to be granted a certificate of citizenship may be granted if he satisfies the Minister This may become effective without an oath of allegiance being taken in any public <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> or - as the Bill now describes it - citizenship ceremony. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This conjures up a picture of tens of thousands of British migrants seriously disaffected because they do not have the privilege of being naturalised at a <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> ceremony and, instead, are seriously discriminated against by being able to acquire citizenship by registration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, by proposing to alter the traditional system whereby British subjects of European origin are required to be in Australia for only one year before <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>, has adopted, whether deliberately or not, a stance Which will be widely interpreted as being unfriendly to British migration and as a deterrent in some cases to British migration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The existence of these inequalities has in the past often deterred migrants from even seeking <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of those not British subjects and eligible to aply for Australain citizenship because they have resided in Australia for 5 years, 701,448 had applied for <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> up until a little earlier this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place it changes the name of the ceremony from a <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> ceremony to a citizenship ceremony. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of migrants have asked me: ‘What does <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> mean? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill seeks to reduce the period of residence after which a migrant may apply for <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> from 5 years to 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we want to retain the largest possible number of migrants who come to Australia we ought to be encouraging them to seek <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> and to want to belong to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point is - the Minister has lost sight of this - that the previous Government was not practising discrimination against nonUnited Kingdom migrants because it applied a different time factor for qualifying for <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> to the non-British migrant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my mind <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> is something which accords to the person who is naturalised and who is a newcomer to this country equal status with a natural born Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 2 of Article 7 which deals with Yugoslav citizenship by <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> states that a person gets this ‘if he has renounced his former citizenship or has a guarantee that this will be possible if he acquires Yugoslav citizenship’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would apply to a person who was an Australian citizen by <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>, that is a citizen not born in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many persons of each nationality were granted Australian citizenship by <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> between 1 January 1945 and 31 December 1972 (Hansard, 9 December 1971, page 4606). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-60-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many persons of each nationality were granted Australian citizenship by <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> in Australia and Papua New Guinea in 1971-72 (Hansard 25 November 1971, page 3757). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-60-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many Certificates of <span class="highlight">Naturalisation</span> were conferred in 1971-72 in each local government area in which more than 100 Certificates were conferred (Hansard, 9 September 1969, page 1020; 2 September 1970, page 904 and 6 October 1971, page 1999). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-60-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee on <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> set up as long ago as 1963 - 10 years ago - recommended the same action as the committee which I set up in 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the second place, loss of original nationality results automatically from  <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>  in the case of persons who were originally nationals of countries such as the USA, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, France, Austria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We could turn Kings Hall into a great place for <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> ceremonies and all manner of public gatherings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to say that in more than 800 local government areas throughout the whole of Australia there has been over the years a very fine effort made by the overwhelming majority of local government bodies and their officers to assist in the carrying out of what were known in the past as <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> ceremonies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It fought very hard to have the renunciation sentence excluded from the oath, but, as I said earlier, as a result of the efforts of the Opposition in the Senate all candidates for <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> and for citizenship will be required to renounce allegiance to the country within the British Commonwealth of Nations from which they have come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth has power in relation to borrowing money on the public credit of the Commonwealth, <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>, service and execution of documents throughout the Commonwealth, and the recognition throughout the Commonwealth of State laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should these British people fail to register by a certain date they will have to go through the normal process of taking out <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> papers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the average time taken in each capital city in processing applications for Australian citizenship from first contact to the <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> ceremony? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-142-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact he was present at the first <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> ceremony held in South Australia and presided over by  Sir Mellis  Napier, the acting Governor at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be seen that the greatest number of aliens, as shown by the number of people receiving certificates of <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>, is in what are called small divisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it is time we made <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> easier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that there is an enormous hold-up on <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> applications simply because people have to be investigated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once a person has lived here in such a way that it can be determined that he intends to stay, that he is part of the scene and is working and paying taxes, <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> ought to be a right, and ought to be easy to get. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The application for <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> ought to be lodged at the local town hall and processed almost immediately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am inclined towards a ceremonial admission to the Australian community but I would make <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> easier with a shorter qualifying period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is wrong to allow people to live for years in our midst and deny them the rights of <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> and all the things that flow from it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal and National Country Parties will reinforce the significance and dignity of citizenship proceedings and <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> ceremonies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have here a copy of his <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> certificate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to 1949 persons naturalised as British subjects were not required to attend conferment ceremonies, but had their certificates of <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> posted to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-33-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have handled hundreds of cases in my time as a member of Parliament on behalf of people who have been excluded from this country, refused residency or refused <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> on these grounds, and eventually I have won a lot of those cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not necessary to produce a birth certificate or a <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> certificate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not like getting a passport, where one has to take along a birth certificate or <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> certificate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time it holds a <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> ceremony and a small pageant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The modifications, which I am announcing today, are designed to provide a framework for the ‘<span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>’ of” foreign-owned companies over a period of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A company in the process of <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> would be given prior credit for achieving 5 1 per cent Australian ownership and would therefore be able to proceed with a new project on the same basis as outlined above. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government would expect the <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> process to take place primarily by way of new share issues to Australians to fund new projects and expansions, rather than by takeovers which will remain subject to case-by-case examination under the Foreign Takeovers Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As part of the arrangements there would need to be a general understanding with the major shareholder interests of the company on the process of <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> and the exercise of voting powers in re,spect of the Australian business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> process to take place primarily by way of new share issues to Australians to fund new projects and expansions, rather than by takeovers which will remain subject to case-by-case examination under the Foreign Takeovers Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would not only expect but we would require that the <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> process should take place, not primarily, but exactly by way of new share issues, and that that should be achieved within a certain time scale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the statement detail, among other things, specific and rigorous criteria relating to the process of <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span>, a policy announced by the Treasurer some time ago but then with only scant attention to the mechanics? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather than just a consolidated statement or booklet we were looking for a statement of policy principles with much grander embellishment than we were given by the Treasurer when he announced the change to the <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not because of the <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> procedure or policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather than the flimsy notification procedures set out in the document, we should have one which would require a company to keep the registrar advised at all times of changes in equity structure or investment plans, so that the registrar could ensure that the <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> policy was being followed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That opportunity should not be presented to them and we urge the Treasurer to re-think his position on the <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> of companies and the affording of Australian status to those companies which happen to have more than 25 per cent Australian ownership; to bring back a new statement which will close some of the loopholes which exist under the present policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members make long speeches at <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> ceremonies about the benefits of becoming naturalised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For years they were refused <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> on the basis of an adverse security report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hundreds of people have had their <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> suspended, held up or denied because of reports from faceless people in the security service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  <span class="highlight">naturalisation</span> was held up for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
