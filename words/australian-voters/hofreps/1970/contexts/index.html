        <h2 id="contexts-in-which-the-phrase-australian-voters-was-used-in-the-house-of-representatives-during-the-1970s">Contexts in which the phrase <strong>australian voters</strong> was used in the House of Representatives during the 1970s</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This is a blatant attempt to disfranchise those <span class="highlight">Australian voters</span> who support neither the Australian Labor Party nor the Liberal or Country Parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Australian public, and in particular the <span class="highlight">Australian voters</span>, are entitled to know where he stands on all of these issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian voters</span> are entitled to know, before they cast their votes in what I believe will be one of the most important elections in our history - an election in which defence and foreign policy must be a major issue - where the Government and the Opposition stand on these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 71 years since Federation <span class="highlight">Australian voters</span> have been subjected to many dishonest compaigns, but never before have they been subjected to the fraud now being perpetrated by the Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian voters</span> have a right to know - not only the country voters but also the urban voters, whose lives are shaped so decisively by the actions or inactions of the Country Party members who are able to pressure their urban coalition colleagues - the Liberals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I congratulate him for the fluency of his initial performance, I can assure him that he underestimates the intelligence of the average Australian voter if he believes that <span class="highlight">Australian voters</span> will accept that the failure to decentralise, the lack of telephones and the total absence of any attempt to develop our tourist industry is the fault of the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that even the honourable member for Mackellar gave the <span class="highlight">Australian voters</span> credit for a little more intelligence than that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian Federal election results have been as close as could realistically be expected to reflecting the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian voters</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last election results prove that <span class="highlight">Australian voters</span> are doing the same sort of thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The heart of the matter we are considering is the democratic right of all <span class="highlight">Australian voters</span> to enjoy equality of representation in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is incredible that this Labor Government should have to take steps to remove the undemocratic, anomalous and unnecessary provision in the Constitution which denies this fundamental right at this date to 130,700 <span class="highlight">Australian voters</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Australian voters</span> on Saturday denied Federal Labor the power directly to control prices and wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be a privilege open to all <span class="highlight">Australian voters</span> whether they live in States or territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will determine whether this country is to be governed by laws made in Parliament by the people freely chosen by the <span class="highlight">Australian voters</span>, or whether we are to be governed by laws that are made in the streets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will not be forgotten and we as an Opposition would be answerable to the 43 per cent of <span class="highlight">Australian voters</span> who supported us if we said: ‘Okay, let us forget all about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter how hard the Prime Minister tries to pretend he is Australia’s George Washington, the <span class="highlight">Australian voters</span> will remember his growing list of repudiated election promises and Australian road users will recall the folly of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There had been occasions during that period when the leaders of the Labor Party had made the most tremendous offers to the <span class="highlight">Australian voters</span> in the hope of gaining their support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Journal  says the devaluation could undermine the reputation with <span class="highlight">Australian voters</span> that gave  Mr Fraser  victory barely a year ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-23-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On previous occasions people were often asked for additional power for the Commonwealth Parliament, and the natural reaction of <span class="highlight">Australian voters</span> to politicians who ask for more power for themselves is to say no. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just nine months ago, the Liberal-Country Party coalition spent a fortune in the election campaign to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian voters</span> how the Labor Party would take away the tax cuts they had promised would operate early in 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are being represented by a rotten, corrupt Government that thinks more about the telexes it receives from the oil companies than it does about those it receives from millions of <span class="highlight">Australian voters</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790327_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Happily, there is now a new climate in the South Australian economy thanks to the wisdom of the South <span class="highlight">Australian voters</span> last Saturday week when they decisively rejected the Labor Government which had been in office for some years and which stultified development in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
